ITEM 2
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations

General

ADMIRAL FINANCIAL CORP. ("ADMIRAL"), an inactive corporation, is currently seeking to recapitalize the Company in order to resume its prior activities with respect to the acquisition and investment in interest-earning assets and specialty real estate, as well as other new lines of business, as yet unidentified.  

Admiral is presently inactive, other than its efforts to seek a merger, exchange of capital stock, asset acquisition, recapitalization, or other similar business combination (a "Recapitalization") with an operating or development stage business which Admiral management considers to have growth potential.  Admiral currently receives no cash flow. Admiral anticipates no capital infusions prior to effectuating a Recapitalization. Until such time as Admiral effectuates a Recapitalization, Admiral currently expects that it will incur minimal future operating costs.

No officer or director of Admiral is paid any type of compensation by Admiral and presently, there are no arrangements or anticipated arrangements to pay any type of compensation to any officer or director in the near future. Admiral expects that it will meet its cash requirements until such time as a Recapitalization occurs. However, in the event Admiral depletes its present cash reserves, or in the event that Admiral Management ceases to perform its duties on a non-compensatory basis, Admiral may cease operations and a Recapitalization may not occur. There are no agreements or understandings of any kind with respect to any loans from officers or directors of Admiral on the Companys behalf.

This discussion may contain statements regarding future financial performance and results.  The realization of outcomes consistent with these forward-looking statements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties to the Company including, but not limited to, the availability of equity capital and financing sources, the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities once such new equity capital and financing is secured (if at all), the successful integration and profitable management of acquired businesses, improvement of operating efficiencies, the availability of working capital and financing for future acquisitions, the Companys ability to grow internally through expansion of services and customer bases without significant increases in overhead, seasonality, cyclicality, and other risk factors.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Admiral is currently inactive.  Admiral management intends to seek a new line of business. as yet unidentified. In connection therewith, Admiral's management believes that a restructuring of Admiral may be necessary in order to raise capital for new operations, and any such restructuring may have a substantial dilutive effect upon Admiral's existing shareholders. Admiral has no known ongoing commitments or obligations.

Comparison of Three Months Ended December 31. 2019 and 2018

Admiral was inactive, and recorded no revenues or expenses during the period.

Comparison of Six Months Ended December 31. 2019 and 2018

Admiral was inactive, and recorded no revenues or expenses during either period.
