Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements1. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the company’s management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates. In the first quarter of 2019, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system. These changes impacted the company’s reportable segments, but did not impact the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to note 8, “Segments,” for additional information on the changes in reportable segments. The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019.Noncontrolling interest amounts of $4.9 million and $3.8 million, net of tax, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $11.9 million and $11.7 million, net of tax, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the company’s 2018 Annual Report.Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated where applicable.2. Accounting Changes:New Standards to be ImplementedIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which changed the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and defined benefit plans. The guidance is effective for each of the topics on January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively, with early adoption of certain provisions permitted. The company early adopted the provision in the fair value guidance that removed the Level 1/Level 2 transfer disclosures. The company is evaluating the adoption date for the remaining changes. As the guidance is a change to disclosures only, the company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the goodwill impairment test by removing Step 2. The guidance also changes the requirements for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires additional disclosures for these reporting units. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The company expects to adopt the guidance on a prospective basis on the effective date. The company is evaluating the impact of the guidance.10
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)In June 2016, with amendments in 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued guidance for credit impairment based on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model. The guidance requires the consideration of all available relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions and forecasts and their implications for expected credit losses. The new guidance expands the scope of financial instruments subject to impairment, including off-balance sheet commitments and residual value. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 with one-year early adoption permitted. The company will adopt the guidance as of the effective date. A cross-functional team was established to evaluate the impact of the guidance on the financial instruments portfolio. All of the changes to systems, processes and policies are on track for completion before the effective date. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.Standards ImplementedThe FASB issued guidance in February 2016, with amendments in 2018 and 2019, which changed the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The guidance also made some changes to lessor accounting, including elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2019, using the transition option whereby prior comparative periods were not retrospectively presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for all asset classes. The company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes. The guidance had a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of the effective date. As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing ROU assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. The transition adjustment recognized in retained earnings on January 1, 2019 was not material. From a lessor perspective, the changes in lease termination guidance and removal of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. Refer to note 5, “Leases,” for additional information, including further discussion on the impact of adoption.In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on a customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in cloud-computing arrangements that are hosted by a vendor. Certain types of implementation costs should be capitalized and amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows entities to elect an option to reclassify the stranded tax effects related to the application of U.S. tax reform from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) to retained earnings. The guidance was effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted, and can be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to all applicable periods. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018, and elected not to reclassify prior periods. In accordance with its accounting policy, the company releases income tax effects from AOCI once the reason the tax effects were established cease to exist (e.g., when available-for-sale debt securities are sold or if a pension plan is liquidated). This guidance allows for the reclassification of stranded tax effects as a result of the change in tax rates from U.S. tax reform to be recorded upon adoption of the guidance rather than at the actual cessation date. At adoption on January 1, 2018, $2.4 billion was reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings, primarily comprised of amounts relating to retirement-related benefit plans.In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain areas, better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and make targeted improvements to presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective January 1, 2019 with early 11
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)adoption permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2018, and it did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance that impacts the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs (net benefit cost). Under the guidance, the service cost component of net benefit cost continues to be presented within cost, SG&A expense and RD&E expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, unless eligible for capitalization. The other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from service cost within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of the effective date. The guidance is primarily a change in financial statement presentation and did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. This presentation change was applied retrospectively upon adoption.In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018 and early adoption was not permitted except for limited provisions. The company adopted the guidance on the effective date. The guidance required certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The amendment also simplified the impairment test of equity investments that lack readily determinable fair value. The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.The FASB issued guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires specific disclosures relating to revenue recognition. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. At adoption, $557 million was reclassified from notes and accounts receivable-trade and deferred income-current to prepaid expenses and other current assets to establish the opening balance for net contract assets. In-scope sales commission costs previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized in deferred costs in accordance with the transition guidance, in the amount of $737 million. Deferred income of $29 million was recorded for certain software licenses that will be recognized over time versus at point in time under previous guidance. Additionally, net deferred taxes were reduced by $184 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, resulting in a cumulative-effect net increase to retained earnings of $524 million. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized an additional impact to net deferred taxes and retained earnings of $56 million, resulting in a total net increase to retained earnings of $580 million. The decrease to net deferred taxes was the result of the company’s election to include Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in measuring deferred taxes. The revenue guidance did not have a material impact in the company’s consolidated financial results. Refer to note 3, “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information.In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changed the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The guidance was effective and adopted by the company on January 1, 2017, and it did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The ongoing impact of the guidance could result in increased volatility in the provision for income taxes and earnings per share in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, depending on the company’s share price at exercise or vesting of share-based awards compared to grant date, however these impacts are not expected to be material. These impacts are recorded on a prospective basis. The company continues to estimate forfeitures in conjunction with measuring stock-based compensation cost. The guidance also requires cash payments on behalf of employees for shares directly withheld for taxes to be presented as financing outflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The FASB also issued guidance in May 2017 and June 2018, which relates to the accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards and accounting for share-based payments issued to non-employees, respectively. The company adopted the guidance for modifications in the second quarter of 2017, and guidance for non-employees’ payments in the second quarter of 2018. The guidance had no impact in the consolidated financial results.​​12

It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings. The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.  16
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)At June 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to RPO related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $119 billion. Given the profile of contract terms, approximately 60 percent of this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next two years, approximately 35 percent between three and five years and the balance (mostly Infrastructure & Cloud Services) thereafter.At December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to RPO related to customer contracts that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $124 billion. Given the profile of contract terms, approximately 60 percent of this amount was expected to be recognized as revenue over the next two years, approximately 35 percent between three and five years and the balance (mostly Infrastructure & Cloud Services) thereafter. Revenue Recognized for Performance Obligations Satisfied (or Partially Satisfied) in Prior PeriodsFor the three and six months ending June 30, 2019, revenue was reduced by $22 million and $35 million, respectively, for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods mainly due to changes in estimates on percentage-of-completion based contracts.  For the three and six months ending June 30, 2018, the impact to revenue for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods was immaterial.Reconciliation of Contract BalancesThe following table provides information about notes and accounts receivables — trade, contract assets and deferred income balances:  ​​​​​​​​​    At June 30,     At December 31, (Dollars in millions)​2019​2018Notes and accounts receivable—trade (net of allowances of $281 and $309 at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively)​$ 7,414​$ 7,432Contract assets(1)​  594​  470Deferred income (current)​  11,261​  11,165Deferred income (noncurrent)​  3,474​  3,445(1)Included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 that was included within the deferred income balance at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and primarily related to services and software. The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at March 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018 was $4.0 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and primarily related to services and software.4. Financial Instruments:Fair Value MeasurementsAccounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:●Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date;17
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)●Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and●Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.The guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort.When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies described below for several parameters that market participants would consider in determining fair value:●Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.●Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.As an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are available for the full term of the derivative.Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale debt securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security, fair value is measured using a model described above.Certain non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, operating right-of-use assets, land, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for non-financial assets depend on the type of asset. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Accounting guidance permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.18

Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair ValueShort-Term Receivables and PayablesNotes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and including short-term finance lease liabilities) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt which would be classified as Level 2.Loans and Long-Term ReceivablesFair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.Long-Term DebtFair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $58,445 million and $35,605 million, and the estimated fair value was $62,018 million and $36,599 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.Available-for-Sale SecuritiesThere were no gross realized gains/losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and gross realized gains/losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were immaterial. After-tax net unrealized holding gains/losses on available-for-sale securities that have been included in other comprehensive income/loss for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial.The contractual maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less than one year at June 30, 2019.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a 20
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.The company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $325 million and $74 million, respectively, for which $8 million of collateral was posted by the company and reduced the position at June 30, 2019 and no collateral was posted at December 31, 2018. Full collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event that the company’s credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $419 million and $731 million, respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This exposure was reduced by $262 million and $267 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at December 31, 2018, this exposure was reduced by $70 million of cash collateral received from counterparties, and no collateral was received at June 30, 2019. There were no non-cash collateral balances received from counterparties in U.S. Treasury securities at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $157 million and $395 million, respectively.  At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the net position related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $320 million and $116 million, respectively.In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. The amount recognized in other receivables for the right to reclaim cash collateral was $8 million at June 30, 2019. No amount was recognized in other receivables at December 31, 2018 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral was $70 million at December 31, 2018. No amount was recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral at June 30, 2019. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was rehypothecated at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.  The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders’ equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.In its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.21
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)Interest Rate RiskFixed and Variable Rate BorrowingsThe company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the company’s interest-rate swaps was $5.5 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was approximately 2.5 years and 3.5 years, respectively. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Forecasted Debt IssuanceThe company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. On May 15, 2019, the company issued an aggregate of $20 billion of indebtedness (see note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional information). Following the receipt of the net proceeds from this debt offering, the company terminated $5.5 billion of forward starting interest-rate swaps. These instruments were designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges for a portion of this issuance and hedged exposure to the variability in future cash flows over a maximum of 30 years. These swaps were the only instruments outstanding under this program at December 31, 2018, and there were no instruments outstanding at June 30, 2019. In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the company's borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $201 million and net losses of $35 million (before taxes) at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $18 million (before taxes) of the deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.Foreign Exchange RiskLong-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)A large portion of the company’s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $6.5 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.2 years at both periods.Anticipated Royalties and Cost TransactionsThe company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $10.0 billion and $9.8 22
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)billion, respectively. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.8 years at both periods.At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of $238 million and net gains of $342 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $133 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.Foreign Currency Denominated BorrowingsThe company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately 12 years. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $12.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $84 million and net gains of $75 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $305 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2019 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure.Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability ManagementThe company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $6.7 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively.Equity Risk ManagementThe company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the company’s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.2 billion at both periods. Other RisksThe company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the 23
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.The company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures. The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.The company is exposed to market volatility on certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or forwards to economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding. The following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as well as for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.24

Leases: The company conducts business as both a lessee and a lessor. In its ordinary course of business, the company enters into leases as a lessee for property, plant and equipment. The company is also the lessor of certain equipment, mainly through its Global Financing segment.28
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)When procuring goods or services, or upon entering into a contract with its clients, the company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. As part of that evaluation, the company considers whether there is an implicitly or explicitly identified asset in the arrangement and whether the company, as the lessee, or the client, if the company is the lessor, has the right to control that asset.The company determines whether there is a right to control the use of the asset by assessing its rights, as the lessee, or the client’s rights, if the company is the lessor, to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset. If there is either an explicit or embedded lease within a contract, the company determines the classification of the lease (e.g., finance, operating, sales-type lease) at the lease commencement date.Accounting for leases as a lesseeEffective January 1, 2019, when the company is the lessee, all leases with a term of more than 12 months are recognized as ROU assets and associated lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the lease payments not yet paid and the company's incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where the company is the lessee. The ROU asset equals the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs (IDCs), prepaid rent and lease incentives. Fixed and in-substance fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities, however, variable lease payments, other than those based on a rate or index, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The company’s variable lease payments generally relate to payments tied to various indexes, non-lease components and payments above a contractual minimum fixed payment.ROU assets represent the company’s right to control the underlying assets under lease, and the lease liability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying assets under lease. Operating leases are included in operating right-of-use assets – net, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. At June 30, 2019, the total amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt was $63 million, $7 million and $65 million, respectively.Finance lease ROU assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the interest expense on the lease liability recorded using the interest method. The amortization and interest expense are recorded separately in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the interest expense on the lease liability are not separately recorded; rather, the lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a single-line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, unless the ROU asset is impaired. The company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of less than 12 months in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.For all asset classes, the company has elected the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) and account for the combined unit as a single lease component. A significant portion of the company’s lease portfolio is real estate, which are mainly accounted for as operating leases, and are primarily used for corporate offices and data centers. The average term of the real estate leases is approximately five years. Certain real estate leases have renewal and/or termination options, which are assessed to determine if those options would affect the duration of the lease term. The company also has equipment leases, such as IT equipment and vehicles, which have lease terms that range from two to five years. For certain equipment leases, the company applies a portfolio approach to account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.29

The company has elected the practical expedient to not provide comparable presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for periods prior to adoption. Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets, and excluding amounts previously reserved, was $1,944 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Rental expense in agreements with rent holidays and scheduled rent increases was previously recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals were included in the determination of rental expense as accruable.The following table, which was included in the company’s 2018 Annual Report, depicts gross minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases, amounts related to vacant space associated with workforce transformation, sublease income commitments and capital lease commitments at December 31, 2018.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​        ​        ​        ​        ​        ​    Beyond(Dollars in millions)​2019​2020​2021​2022​2023​2023Operating lease commitments ​   ​   ​   ​   ​   ​  Gross minimum rental commitments ​   ​   ​   ​   ​   ​  (including vacant space below)​$ 1,581​$ 1,233​$ 914​$ 640​$ 445​$ 815Vacant space​$ 29​$ 23​$ 14​$ 9​$ 5​$ 8Sublease income commitments​$ 11​$ 7​$ 5​$ 4​$ 4​$ 2Capital lease commitments​$ 3​$ 3​$ 3​$ 3​$ 2​$ 28​The difference between the company’s total lease commitments as reported at December 31, 2018 compared to the January 1, 2019 ROU asset balance in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is primarily due to the required use of a discount factor (imputed interest) under the new lease guidance and certain amounts that are not included in the ROU asset under the new lease guidance (e.g., tenant incentives and vacant space).Accounting for leases as a lessorThe company typically enters into leases as an alternative means of realizing value from equipment that it would otherwise sell. Assets under lease include new and used IBM equipment and certain OEM products. IBM equipment generally consists of IBM Z, Power Systems and Storage Systems products.Lease payments due to IBM are typically fixed and paid in equal installments over the lease term. The majority of the company’s leases do not contain variable payments that are dependent on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate (e.g., property taxes), that are paid directly by the company and are reimbursed by the client, are recorded as revenue, along with the related cost, in the period in which collection of these payments is probable. Payments that are made directly by the client to a third party, including certain property taxes and insurance, are not considered part of variable payments and therefore are not recorded by the company.  The company has made a policy election to exclude from consideration in contracts all collections from sales and other similar taxes.31
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)The company’s payment terms for leases are typically unconditional. Therefore, in an instance when the client requests to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term, the client would typically be required to pay the remaining lease payments in full. At the end of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment at the then-current fair market value or at a pre-stated purchase price or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms. When lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.The following tables present amounts included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to lessor activity:​​​​(Dollars in millions)        ​For the three months ended June 30:​2019Lease income — sales-type and direct financing leases ​  Sales-type lease selling price​$ 179Less: Carrying value of underlying assets, excluding unguaranteed residual value​  74Gross profit​  105Interest income on lease receivables​  73Total sales-type and direct financing lease income​$ 178Lease income — operating leases​  82Variable lease income​  9Total lease income​$ 269​​​​​(Dollars in millions)        ​For the six months ended June 30:​2019Lease income — sales-type and direct financing leases ​  Sales-type lease selling price​$ 328Less: Carrying value of underlying assets, excluding unguaranteed residual value​  129Gross profit​  199Interest income on lease receivables​  151Total sales-type and direct financing lease income​$ 350Lease income — operating leases​  172Variable lease income​  27Total lease income​$ 548​Sales-Type and Direct Financing Leases If a lease is classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from inventory and a net investment in the lease is recorded. For a sales-type lease, the net investment in the lease is measured at commencement date as the sum of the lease receivable and the estimated residual value of the equipment less unearned income and allowance for credit losses. At June 30, 2019, the unguaranteed residual value of sales-type and direct financing leases was $582 million. For further information on the company’s net investment in leases, including residual values, refer to note 6, “Financing Receivables.” Any selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement. Selling profit or loss is presented on a gross basis when the company enters into a lease to realize value from a product that it would otherwise sell in its ordinary course of business, whereas in transactions where the company enters into a lease for the purpose of generating revenue by providing financing, the selling profit or loss is presented on a net basis. Under a sales-type lease, initial direct costs are expensed at lease commencement. Over the term of the lease, the company recognizes finance income on the net investment in the lease and any variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease.32
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)For a direct financing lease, the investment in the lease is measured similarly to a sales-type lease, however, the net investment in the lease is reduced by any selling profit. In a direct financing lease, the selling profit and initial direct costs are deferred at commencement and recognized over the lease term. The company rarely enters into direct financing leases.The estimated residual value represents the estimated fair value of the equipment under lease at the end of the lease. Estimating residual value is a risk unique to financing activities, and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values. The company has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. The company estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technology innovations.The company optimizes the recovery of residual values by extending lease arrangements with, or selling leased equipment to existing clients. The company has historically managed residual value risk both through insight into its own product cycles and monitoring of OEM IT product announcements. The company periodically reassesses the realizable value of its lease residual values. Anticipated decreases in specific future residual values that are considered to be other-than-temporary are recognized immediately upon identification and are recorded as an adjustment to the residual value estimate. For sales-type and direct financing leases, this reduction lowers the recorded net investment and is recognized as a loss charged to finance income in the period in which the estimate is changed, as well as an adjustment to unearned income to reduce future-period financing activities. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, impairment of residual values was immaterial.The following table presents a maturity analysis of the lease payments due to IBM on sales-type and direct financing leases over the next five years and thereafter, as well as a reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to the financing receivables recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at June 30, 2019:​​​​​(Dollars in millions)    Total Remainder of 2019​$ 1,496​2020​  2,199​2021​  1,426​2022​  654​2023​  166​Thereafter​  25​Total undiscounted cash flows​$ 5,967​Present value of lease payments (recognized as financing receivables)​  5,494*Difference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows​$ 473​*  The present value of the lease payments will not equal the financing receivables balances in the Statement of Financial Position, due to certain items including IDC's, allowance for credit losses and residual values, which are included in the financing receivables balance, but are not included in the future lease payments.Operating LeasesEquipment provided to clients under an operating lease is carried at cost within property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method, generally ranging from one to six years. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. At June 30, 2019, the unguaranteed residual value of operating leases was $97 million.At commencement of an operating lease, IDCs are deferred. As lease payments are made, the company records sales revenue over the lease term. IDCs are amortized over the lease term on the same basis as lease income is recorded.33

The impairment test is based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, the asset is written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.  There were no material impairment losses incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 for assets under operating leases.  These assets are included in “Property, plant and equipment — net” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.6. Financing Receivables: Financing receivables primarily consist of client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), investment in sales-type and direct financing leases and commercial financing receivables. Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) are provided primarily to clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years. Client loans and installment payment financing contracts are priced independently at competitive market rates. Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s Systems products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, the company is winding down the portion of its commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers, which has resulted in a reduction of commercial financing receivables. This wind down is consistent with IBM’s capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.A summary of the components of the company’s financing receivables is presented as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​    Investment in        ​    Client Loan and        ​​​Sales-Type and​Commercial​Installment Payment​​​(Dollars in millions)​Direct Financing​Financing​Receivables/​​​At June 30, 2019:​Leases​Receivables​(Loans)​TotalFinancing receivables, gross​$ 5,978​$ 5,936​$ 12,800​$ 24,714Unearned income​  (473)​​ (18)​​ (611)​​ (1,102)Recorded investment​$ 5,505​$ 5,918​$ 12,189​$ 23,612Allowance for credit losses​  (89)​​ (15)​​ (175)​​ (278)Unguaranteed residual value​  582​​ —​​ —​​ 582Guaranteed residual value​  68​​ —​​ —​​ 68Total financing receivables, net​$ 6,066​$ 5,903​$ 12,014​$ 23,984Current portion​$ 2,338​$ 5,903​$ 7,302​$ 15,543Noncurrent portion​$ 3,728​$ —​$ 4,713​$ 8,441​34

Commercial financing receivables are excluded from the presentation of financing receivables by portfolio segment, as they are short term in nature and the current estimated risk of loss and resulting impact to the company’s financing results are not material. The company determines its allowance for credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan receivables, and further segments the portfolio into three classes: Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(Dollars in millions)        ​        ​        ​        ​At June 30, 2019:​Americas​EMEA​Asia Pacific​TotalRecorded investment ​   ​   ​   ​  Lease receivables​$ 3,336​$ 1,149​$ 1,020​$ 5,505Loan receivables​  6,208​  3,443​$ 2,538​$ 12,189Ending balance​$ 9,544​$ 4,592​$ 3,558​$ 17,694Recorded investment collectively evaluated for impairment​$ 9,400​$ 4,544​$ 3,509​$ 17,453Recorded investment individually evaluated for impairment​$ 144​$ 48​$ 49​$ 241​​​​​​​​​​​​​Allowance for credit losses​   ​   ​   ​   Beginning balance at January 1, 2019​   ​   ​   ​   Lease receivables​$ 53​$ 22​$ 24​$ 99Loan receivables​  105​  43​$ 32​$ 179Total​$ 158​$ 65​$ 56​$ 279Write-offs​$ (11)​$ (2)​$ (3)​$ (16)Recoveries​  0​  0​$ 0​$ 0Provision / (benefit)​  (1)​  (6)​$ 0​$ (7)Other*​  6​  0​$ 0​$ 6Ending balance at June 30, 2019​$ 152​$ 57​$ 54​$ 263Lease receivables​$ 48​$ 17​$ 24​$ 89Loan receivables​$ 104​$ 41​$ 30​$ 175​​​​​​​​​​​​​Related allowance, collectively evaluated for impairment​$ 31​$ 12​$ 5​$ 48Related allowance, individually evaluated for impairment​$ 122​$ 45​$ 49​$ 215* Primarily represents translation adjustments.Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $8 million each, for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were $14 million and $2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.When determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. The company considers any receivable with an individually evaluated reserve as an impaired receivable.In addition, the company records an unallocated reserve that is determined by applying a reserve rate to its different portfolios, excluding accounts that have been specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit rating, probability of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.Past Due Financing ReceivablesThe company considers a client’s financing receivable balance past due when any installment is aged over 90 days. The following table summarizes information about the recorded investment in lease and loan financing receivables, 37

The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moody’s, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings.The following tables present the recorded investment net of allowance for credit losses for each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

In addition, the company is presenting the results of its announced divestitures in an “Other” segment, as the realignment of these businesses allows for a better representation of management’s view of the company, as well as the ongoing operational performance of the reportable segments. The company’s segments are as follows:​​​​​2018 Segments    Changes (+/-)    2019 Segments​​​​​Cognitive Solutions + Integration Software Cloud & Cognitive Software​ + Security Services​​​ - Divested Select Software*​​​ + Red Hat (post closing)​​​​​​​Global Business Services - Divested Mortgage Servicing** Global Business Services​​​​​Technology Services & Cloud Platforms - Security Services Global Technology Services​ - Integration Software​​​​​​​Systems    Systems​​​​​Global Financing    Global Financing​​​​​Other + Divested Mortgage Servicing** Other​​+ Divested Select Software*​​*    IBM completed the sales of select software products and marketing and platform commerce offerings (in the U.S.) on June 30, 2019.

As required by U.S. GAAP, this resulted in a change in the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants, which was 18 years as of December 31, 2018. Recognized actuarial losses decreased by approximately $240 million and $480 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily driven by the change in amortization period. There was no impact to funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S. Qualified PPP as a result of this change.In 2019, the company expects to contribute approximately $400 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans, the largest of which will be contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in Japan, Spain and Belgium. This amount generally represents the legally mandated minimum contribution. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six months of 2019 were $128 million, of which $63 million was in cash and $65 million in U.S. Treasury securities. Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six months of 2018 were $237 million, of which $80 million was in cash and $157 million in U.S. Treasury securities. The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.48

Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)11. Acquisitions/Divestitures:AcquisitionsThe company did not enter into any acquisition transactions during the six months ended June 30, 2019.Red Hat - On July 9, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Red Hat. Red Hat’s vast portfolio of open-source technologies, innovative cloud development platform and developer community, combined with IBM’s innovative hybrid cloud technology, industry expertise, and commitment to data, trust and security, will deliver the hybrid multicloud capabilities required to address the next chapter of cloud implementations as well as accelerate the company’s growth. Red Hat’s business model is based upon open-source software, which is an alternative to proprietary software in relation to the development and licensing of the commercial software code. For Red Hat’s open-source software subscriptions, no revenue is recognized upfront from the licensing of the code itself, but rather, is recognized over time throughout the contract term as control of the promised product or service is transferred to the customer.        On the acquisition date, Red Hat shareholders were entitled to receive $190 per share in cash, which represented a total equity value of approximately $34 billion and was remitted to the paying agent. The company funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. Refer to note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional details on the financing of the transaction. The initial accounting for the Red Hat acquisition is not complete due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date. In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance. This will result in a non-cash adjustment to the acquired deferred revenue balance and a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment will reflect the high margin profile of Red Hat’s business.​DivestituresSelect IBM Software Products – On December 6, 2018, IBM and HCL Technologies Limited (HCL) announced a definitive agreement, in which HCL would acquire select standalone Cloud and Cognitive Software products for $1,775 million, inclusive of $150 million of contingent consideration. The software products in-scope include AppScan, BigFix, Unica, Commerce, Portal, Notes, Domino and Connections. The transaction included commercial software, intellectual property and services offerings. In addition, the transaction includes transition services for IT and other services. The initial terms of the transition services are generally less than one year, however, HCL can renew certain services up to an additional year.       The transaction closed on June 30, 2019. The company received cash of $812 million at closing and expects to receive an additional $813 million within 12 months of closing. The company recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $556 million on June 30, 2019 which was recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The total gain on sale may change in the future due to contingent consideration or changes in other transaction estimates, however, material changes are not expected.​Select IBM Marketing Platform and Commerce Offerings – On April 4, 2019, IBM and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (Centerbridge) announced a definitive agreement, in which Centerbridge would acquire select marketing platform and commerce offerings from IBM, including Customer Experience Analytics, Content Hub and Marketing Assistant, among others. The transaction included commercial software and services offerings. In addition, the company will provide Centerbridge with transition services including IT, supply chain management, and other services, with initial terms generally of nine months, with renewal options up to nine months. Upon closing, Centerbridge announced that this business would be re-branded under the name Acoustic. The closing completed for the U.S. on June 30, 2019. The company expects a subsequent closing for the remaining countries to occur within 12 months. The timing of the subsequent closing is subject to change as more information becomes available. The company received a net cash payment of $240 million at the U.S. closing and expects to receive an additional $150 million within 36 months.50

The amount of the pre-tax gain for the remaining countries will not be determinable until the valuation of the final balance sheet transferred is completed, however, it is not expected to be material.​Seterus – On January 3, 2019, IBM and Mr. Cooper Group announced a definitive agreement, in which Mr. Cooper Group acquired IBM’s Seterus home mortgage servicing platform business. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2019. The financial terms related to this transaction were not material.The above three divested businesses are reported in other – divested businesses. Refer to note 8, “Segments,” for additional information. Other – In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Global Financing segment entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain commercial financing capabilities and assign a number of its commercial financing contracts, excluding related receivables which will be collected as they become due in the normal course of business. These commercial financing capabilities and contracts have been reported within IBM’s Global Financing segment. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2019. The financial terms related to this transaction were not material.12.

Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)restrict the company’s ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. The company is in compliance with all of its significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, upon the company’s announcement of its intent to acquire Red Hat, IBM entered into a commitment letter under which certain banks committed to provide the company with a 364-day unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $20 billion to fund the acquisition. The company also entered into a fee letter in connection with the 364-day bridge facility, under which the company incurred $60 million in fees. These fees were capitalized and were fully amortized to SG&A in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings as of June 30, 2019.On May 15, 2019, the company issued an aggregate of $20 billion of indebtedness in the following eight tranches: $1.5 billion of 2-year floating rate notes priced at 3 month LIBOR plus 40 basis points, $1.5 billion of 2-year fixed rate notes with a 2.8 percent coupon, $2.75 billion of 3-year fixed rate notes with a 2.85 percent coupon, $3.0 billion of 5-year fixed rate notes with a 3.0 percent coupon, $3.0 billion of 7-year fixed rate notes with a 3.3 percent coupon, $3.25 billion of 10-year fixed rate notes with a 3.5 percent coupon, $2.0 billion of 20-year fixed rate notes with a 4.15 percent coupon and $3.0 billion of 30-year fixed rate notes with a 4.25 percent coupon. Following receipt of the net proceeds from this multi-tranche debt offering, on May 15, 2019, and in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter, IBM notified the banks of IBM’s termination of all commitments under the commitment letter. There were no early termination penalties. The proceeds from these debt issuances were primarily used for the acquisition of Red Hat. For additional information on this transaction, see note 11, “Acquisitions/Divestitures.”​Additionally, the long-term debt table above includes Euro bonds that were issued in the first quarter of 2019 to partially finance the acquisition of Red Hat upon closing. ​Pre-swap annual contractual obligations of long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2019, are as follows:​​​​​(Dollars in millions)    Total2019 (for Q3-Q4)​$ 3,4862020​  7,4132021​  9,7422022​  7,1042023​  5,3952024 and beyond​  32,429Total​$ 65,569​Interest on Debt​​​​​​​​(Dollars in millions)        ​        ​For the six months ended June 30:​2019​2018Cost of financing​$ 343​$ 375Interest expense​  558​  338Interest capitalized​  3​  3Total interest paid and accrued​$ 904​$ 717​55

In addition, the company and IBM Credit LLC entered into a new $2.5 billion 364-day Credit Agreement to replace the existing $2.5 billion 364-day Credit Agreement, and also extended the maturity date of the existing $2.5 billion Three-Year Credit Agreement. The new maturity dates for the Three-Year and Five-Year Credit Agreements are July 20, 2022 and July 20, 2024, respectively. Each of the facility sizes remain unchanged. As of June 30, 2019, there were no borrowings by the company, or its subsidiaries, under the Credit Facilities.​14. Contingencies:As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise.The company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed in this note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company’s experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the company’s potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter.56
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company.The company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux and the company has asserted counterclaims. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v. IBM case. In February 2016, the Federal Court ruled in favor of IBM on all of SCO’s remaining claims, and SCO appealed.  On October 30, 2017, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of all but one of SCO’s remaining claims, which was remanded to the Federal Court in Utah. On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social service program processing in Indiana. After six weeks of trial, on July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the State’s claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed portions of the trial judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to determine the State’s damages, if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial court’s award of damages to IBM. On March 22, 2016, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the outcome of the Indiana Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the Indiana Superior Court. On August 7, 2017, the Indiana Superior Court awarded the State $128 million, which it then offset against IBM’s previously affirmed award of $50 million, resulting in a $78 million award to the State, plus interest. On September 28, 2018, the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Court’s $78 million award to the State, but reversed the Superior Court by awarding IBM interest on its previously affirmed $50 million award. On June 26, 2019, the Indiana Supreme Court reversed the Indiana Court of Appeals’ award of interest to IBM, but otherwise affirmed the Superior Court’s and the Court of Appeals’ awards.  IBM has petitioned the Indiana Supreme Court for rehearing.  The matter remains pending.​On March 9, 2017, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Department of Labor and Industry sued IBM in Pennsylvania state court regarding a 2006 contract for the development of a custom software system to manage the Commonwealth’s unemployment insurance benefits programs. The matter is pending in a Pennsylvania court.Following the 2017 final judgment of the Appeal Court in London holding that IBM UK acted lawfully in 2010 in closing its UK defined benefit plans to future accruals for most participants and in implementing a new retirement policy, the Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK is expected to address approximately 290 individual actions alleging constructive dismissal and age discrimination brought against IBM UK in 2010 by employees who left the company at that time. The individual actions were previously stayed.In May 2015, a putative class action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York related to the company’s October 2014 announcement that it was divesting its global commercial 57
Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)semiconductor technology business, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Management’s Retirement Plans Committee and three current or former IBM executives are named as defendants. On September 29, 2017, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. On December 10, 2018, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court order. On June 3, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States granted defendants’ request to hear the case.The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately $950 million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.15. Commitments:The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $4,783 million and $7,368 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the company’s business partners to support their working capital needs. The decrease reflects the company’s wind down of its OEM IT commercial financing operations. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $5,033 million and $4,432 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.The company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.The company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the company’s payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $25 million and $26 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, 58

As a result of these changes, the company revised its reportable segments. There is no change to the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to note 8, “Segments” for additional information on the changes in reportable segments. The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. The company provided recast historical segment information reflecting these changes in a Form 8-K dated April 4, 2019.Currency:The references to “adjusted for currency” or “at constant currency” in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When the company refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusts such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for additional information.Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings:In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, the company separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs and discontinued 62
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)operations and their related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), the company characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections, any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company’s acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. The company includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business.Overall, the company believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The company’s reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest the company routinely receives from investors and analysts.The following table provides the company’s operating (non-GAAP) earnings for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018.​​​​​​​​​​​        ​        ​    Yr. to Yr. (Dollars in millions except per share amounts)​​​​​​​Percent For the three months ended June 30:​2019​2018​Change Net income as reported​$ 2,498​$ 2,404  3.9%Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax​  (1)​  1 nm​Income from continuing operations​$ 2,499​$ 2,402  4.0%Non-operating adjustments (net of tax):​ ​​      ​Acquisition-related charges​  217​  160  35.6​Non-operating retirement-related costs/(income)​  97​  286  (66.2)​U.S. tax reform charges​  14​  (14) nm​Operating (non-GAAP) earnings*​$ 2,827​$ 2,834  (0.3)%Diluted operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share​$ 3.17​$ 3.08  2.9%* Refer to page 98 for a more detailed reconciliation of net income to operating earnings.nm - not meaningfulFinancial Performance Summary — Three Months Ended June 30:       In the second quarter of 2019, the company reported $19.2 billion in revenue, $2.5 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.8 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.81 as reported and $3.17 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company also generated 63
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)$2.9 billion in cash from operations, $2.4 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $1.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends. This performance reflects improving fundamentals as the company continues to focus on investment prioritization shifting to higher value areas and the value the company provides to clients in their digital transformations and journey to the cloud. The company has taken significant actions to improve its position over time including the completion of the two software asset divestitures and workforce actions in the second quarter as well as the acquisition of Red Hat on July 9, 2019. This acquisition is an important milestone for the company, and one that will significantly impact the cloud landscape.  It is clear that the next chapter of cloud will be about shifting mission-critical work to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems. This requires a hybrid, multicloud, open approach, to provide portability, management consistency and security for enterprise workloads.​        Total consolidated revenue decreased 4.2 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Cloud & Cognitive Software increased 3.2 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency with growth across all three business lines of the segment. Cognitive Applications grew 2.9 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency, Cloud & Data Platforms increased 4.5 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency and Transaction Processing Platforms grew 2.0 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. Global Business Services (GBS) increased 0.5 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency led by Consulting which grew 2.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency). Global Technology Services (GTS) decreased 6.7 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency), with declines in Infrastructure & Cloud Services and Technology Support Services reflecting actions taken to deemphasize lower-value contracts and third-party content. Systems decreased 19.5 percent as reported (18 percent adjusted for currency), with IBM Z declining 41.8 percent (41 percent adjusted for currency) year to year reflecting the product cycle dynamics. Storage Systems decreased year to year with declines in high-end product sales which is tied to the mainframe cycle and the ongoing competitive dynamics and pricing pressures in the mid-range.  Power Systems grew as reported and adjusted for currency with the continued strong performance of POWER9.​       Total cloud revenue of $4.8 billion in the second quarter of 2019 grew 2 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency. Over the trailing 12 months, total cloud revenue was $19.5 billion, up 5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. As-a-Service revenue increased 4 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the prior-year period and grew 13 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency) over the trailing 12 months. The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue was $11.5 billion. ​       From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 4.4 percent year to year as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) decreased 4.0 percent, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific declined 4.1 percent year to year as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency).        The consolidated gross margin of 47.0 percent increased 1.0 points year to year, and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 47.4 percent increased 1.0 points versus the prior year, reflecting strong software growth, services productivity and cloud scale efficiencies.  ​       Total expense and other (income) decreased 2.8 percent in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by gains from the divestitures (9 points), the impact of currency (4 points) and lower non-operating retirement-related costs (4 points), partially offset by a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges (7 points) and higher spending and litigation matters (5 points). Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 0.2 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors, excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs.​ Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.8 billion decreased 0.3 percent and the pre-tax margin was 14.4 percent, an increase of 0.6 points versus the prior-year period. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 9.7 percent, a decrease of 3.7 points compared to the second quarter of 2018. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by an increase in tax benefits attributable to foreign audit activity (3.7 points). Net income of $2.5 billion increased 3.9 percent and the net income margin was 13.0 percent, an increase of 1.0 points year to year. ​64

The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 11.0 percent, a decrease of 5.0 points compared to the second quarter of 2018. The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factor mentioned above. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.8 billion decreased 0.3 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 14.8 percent, up 0.6 points year to year.​       Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.81 in the second quarter of 2019 increased 7.7 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.17 increased 2.9 percent versus the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.3 billion and had $2.1 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at June 30, 2019.        The company generated $2.9 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.6 billion compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.7 billion). In the second quarter of 2019, investing activities were a net source of cash of $4.2 billion compared to a net use of cash of $0.6 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by non-operating finance receivables ($3.1 billion), an increase in cash provided by current year divestitures ($0.9 billion) and a decrease in net capital expenditures ($0.6 billion).

Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $46.4 billion, an increase of $34.2 billion from December 31, 2018. Cash and debt balances increased since year-end 2018, as the company prepared for the acquisition of Red Hat. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows were:        Total assets increased $31.3 billion ($30.9 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2018 driven by:​●An increase of $34.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, which was subsequently used to fund the Red Hat acquisition on July 9, 2019; and​●An increase in operating right-of-use assets of $5.0 billion resulting from the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019; partially offset by​●A decrease in total receivables of $6.6 billion primarily driven by a decline in financing receivables due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.​       Total liabilities increased $30.4 billion ($30.2 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2018 driven by:​●An increase in total debt of $27.2 billion primarily driven by new issuances; and​●An increase in operating lease liabilities of $5.3 billion resulting from the adoption of the new leasing standard.​       Total equity of $17.8 billion increased $0.8 billion from December 31, 2018 as a result of:​●Increases from net income of $4.1 billion and retirement related plans of $0.8 billion; partially offset by​●Decreases from dividends of $2.8 billion and gross share repurchases of $1.2 billion. ​       The company generated $7.7 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.8 billion compared to the first six months of 2018, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.8 billion). In the first six months of 2019, investing activities were a net source of cash of $3.3 billion compared to a net use of cash of $2.4 billion in the prior year. The year-to-year increase in investing cash flows was driven by an increase in cash provided by non-operating finance receivables ($3.4 billion), cash provided by current year divestitures ($0.9 67
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)billion) and a decrease in net capital expenditures ($0.9 billion). In the first six months of 2019, financing activities were a source of cash of $22.9 billion compared to a use of cash of $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2018. The $28.3 billion increase in financing cash flows year to year was driven by an increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions ($27.8 billion) primarily driven by a higher level of issuances to fund the acquisition of Red Hat.

In the second quarter, Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue of $5,174 million decreased 7.2 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period, driven by declines across the portfolio. As this business is repositioned for the long term, the actions contribute to lower revenue in the short term, but are expected to enable the business to deliver sustained margin improvement. Technology Support Services second-quarter revenue of $1,663 million decreased 4.9 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) due primarily to hardware cycle dynamics.       Within GTS, cloud revenue of $2.0 billion grew 2 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2019, with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $7.4 billion. For the first six months of the year, cloud revenue of $4.1 billion grew 5 percent as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency).​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr. ​​​​​​​​Percent/ (Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Margin For the three months ended June 30:    2019    2018*    Change Global Technology Services:    ​   ​     ​External gross profit​$ 2,353​$ 2,435  (3.3)%External gross profit margin​  34.4%    33.2%   1.2pts.Pre-tax income​$ 235​$ 451  (47.9)%Pre-tax margin​  3.3%    6.0%   (2.7)pts.* Recast to reflect segment changes.73

Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the company’s clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.Services signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.Signings include Infrastructure & Cloud Services, Security Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Technology Support Services (TSS) are generally not included in signings as the maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings.74
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr. ​​​​​​​​​​Percent ​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr.​Change (Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Percent​Adjusted For For the three months ended June 30:    2019    2018    Change    Currency Total signings​$ 9,687​$ 11,528  (16.0)%   (14.2)%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr. ​​​​​​​​​​Percent ​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr.​Change (Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Percent​Adjusted For For the six months ended June 30:    2019    2018    Change    Currency Total signings​$ 17,324​$ 20,836  (16.9)%   (14.0)%​Systems​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr. ​​​​​​​​​​Percent ​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr.​Change (Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Percent​Adjusted For For the three months ended June 30:    2019    2018    Change    Currency Systems external revenue:​$ 1,753​$ 2,177  (19.5)%   (18.0)%Systems Hardware​$ 1,328​$ 1,756  (24.4)%   (23.1)%IBM Z​   ​     (41.8)  (40.9)​Power Systems​   ​     1.0  2.9​Storage Systems​   ​     (22.0)  (20.7)​Operating Systems Software​  425​  421  1.0  3.3​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr. ​​​​​​​​​​Percent ​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr.​Change (Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Percent​Adjusted For For the six months ended June 30:    2019    2018    Change    Currency Systems external revenue:​$ 3,081​$ 3,676  (16.2)%   (14.2)%Systems Hardware​$ 2,241​$ 2,848  (21.3)%   (19.6)%IBM Z​   ​     (40.8)  (39.8)​Power Systems​   ​     3.1  5.7​Storage Systems​   ​     (18.6)  (16.7)​Operating Systems Software​  840​  828  1.4  4.2​​Systems revenue of $1,753 million decreased 19.5 percent as reported (18 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year.

In the second quarter, the company announced IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers available in the IBM Cloud which provide clients with hybrid cloud scaleup compute for AIX and IBM i workloads. There was continued double-digit growth in the high-end Power systems, partially offset by declines in the low-end and midrange systems, as reported and adjusted for currency.Storage Systems revenue decreased 22.0 percent as reported (21 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting a decline in high-end storage, which is tied to the mainframe cycle and the ongoing competitive dynamics and pricing pressures in the mid-range products.In the second quarter, Operating Systems Software revenue of $425 million increased 1.0 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. This growth was driven by strong performance in IBM Z operating system software as clients continue to rely on the IBM Z platform to manage predictable IT spending for mission critical workloads, partially offset by a decline in Power operating system software.

Pre-tax margin decreased 7.6 points year to year to (4.1) percent, primarily due to the IBM Z product cycle.Global FinancingGlobal Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.Results of Operations​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr.​​​​​​​​​Percent/​(Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Margin​For the three months ended June 30:    2019    2018    Change​External revenue​$ 351​$ 394  (11.0)%Internal revenue​  281​  473  (40.6)​Total revenue​$ 632​$ 867  (27.1)%Pre-tax income​$ 239​$ 357  (33.1)%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Yr. to Yr.​​​​​​​​​Percent/​(Dollars in millions)​​​​​​​Margin​For the six months ended June 30:    2019    2018    Change​External revenue​$ 757​$ 799  (5.3)%Internal revenue​  581​  902  (35.6)​Total revenue​$ 1,338​$ 1,701  (21.3)%Pre-tax income​$ 527​$ 734  (28.1)%​In the second quarter, Global Financing total revenue of $632 million declined 27.1 percent compared to the prior year.

External revenue decreased 11.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in external used equipment sales (down 32.1 percent to $65 million), and a decrease in external financing (down 4.2 percent to $286 million).77
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)The decrease in total revenue of $363 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 was due to a decrease in internal revenue of 35.6 percent, driven by a decrease in internal used equipment sales (down 46.0 percent to $377 million), partially offset by an increase in internal financing (up 0.3 percent to $205 million). External revenue decreased 5.3 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), driven by a decline in external used equipment sales (down 28.2 percent to $134 million), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 1.7 percent to $623 million). The decrease in internal and external financing revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to lower average asset balances, partially offset by higher asset yields. The increase in internal and external financing revenue for the first six months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to higher asset yields, partially offset by lower average asset balances.Total sales of used equipment represented 40.1 percent and 38.2 percent of Global Financing’s revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to 54.0 percent and 52.0 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The decrease in both periods was due to lower volumes of both internal and external used equipment sales. The gross profit margin on used sales was 53.7 percent and 58.3 percent in the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 53.0 percent and 58.6 percent in the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Global Financing pre-tax income decreased 33.1 percent to $239 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower gross profit of $165 million, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $47 million. The decline in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for credit losses driven by lower reserve requirements in the current year.  Pre-tax income decreased 28.1 percent to $527 million in the first six months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower gross profit of $299 million, partially offset by a decrease in expense of $92 million, which included a lower provision for credit losses and the gain from the sale of certain commercial financing capabilities in the first quarter of 2019.Global Financing return on equity was 24.9 percent and 19.2 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 31.2 percent and 31.9 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in return on equity in both periods was driven by a decline in net income. Net income included higher tax expense in the first quarter of 2019 due to additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation tax.

Total cost for the first six months of 2019 decreased $561 million versus the first six months of 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($570 million) primarily due to the amortization period change and higher expected return on plan assets ($57 million); partially offset by higher interest costs ($76 million).​       As described in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter of 2019 were $358 million, a decrease of $6 million compared to the second quarter of 2018. Non-operating costs of $136 million in the second quarter of 2019 decreased $258 million year to year, driven primarily by lower recognized actuarial losses ($281 million) and a higher expected return on plan assets ($31 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($40 million). For the first six months of 2019, operating retirement-related costs were $711 million, a decrease of $39 million and non-operating costs were $274 million, a decrease of $522 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the same factors as above. ​Taxes       The continuing operations effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 9.7 percent, a decrease of 3.7 points compared to the second quarter of 2018.  The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was 12.0 percent, an increase of 16.3 points compared to the first six months of 2018.   The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 11.0 percent, a decrease of 5.0 points compared to the second quarter of 2018.  The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was 10.6 percent, an increase of 10.4 points compared to the first six months of 2018.  The decrease in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in tax benefits attributable to foreign audit activity (3.7 points).  The change in the continuing operations tax rate for the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by reduced audit resolution benefits. The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors. ​        With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2014. The company's U.S. income tax returns for 2013 and 2014 continue to be examined by the IRS with specific focus on certain cross-border transactions in 2013.

The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.​The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2019 is $6,520 million which can be reduced by $636 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with timing adjustments, U.S. tax credits, potential transfer pricing adjustments, and state income taxes. The net amount of $5,884 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company’s effective tax rate.Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

In the first six months of 2019, the company generated $7,700 million in net cash from operations, compared to $6,896 million in the first six months of 2018. The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities. The strong free cash flow generated by the company, portfolio actions taken and the suspension of share repurchases position IBM to return to its target leverage ratios within a couple of years.The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial position, which reflects the wind down of its OEM IT commercial financing operations.

Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing. The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at June 30, 2019.91
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note 8, “Segments.” In the company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.EquityTotal equity increased $847 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases from net income ($4,089 million) and retirement-related plans ($760 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends paid ($2,833 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,315 million) primarily due to share repurchases.Cash FlowThe company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.​​​​​​​(Dollars in millions)​​​​​​For the six months ended June 30:    2019    2018Net cash provided by/(used in) continuing operations: ​   ​  Operating activities​$ 7,700​$ 6,896Investing activities​  3,309​  (2,399)Financing activities​  22,894​  (5,428)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash​  27​  (344)Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash​$ 33,930​$ (1,274)​Net cash provided by operating activities increased $804 million as compared to the first six months of 2018 driven primarily by:●An increase of $799 million in cash provided by financing receivables.Investing activities were a net source of cash of $3,309 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to a net use of cash of $2,399 million in the first six months of 2018. The year-to-year increase in cash flow of $5,708 million was driven by:●An increase of $3,406 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations; and●An increase in cash provided by current year divestitures of $888 million; and●A decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures of $852 million.Financing activities were a net source of cash of $22,894 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to a net use of cash of $5,428 million in the first six months of 2018.  The year-to-year increase in cash flow of $28,321 million was driven by:●An increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions of $27,824 million primarily driven by a higher level of issuances as the company prepared to close the Red Hat acquisition.92
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)Looking ForwardThe company’s strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy.As part of its long-term strategic model, the company expects to continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively to investments, and to return value to shareholders. Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the company’s innovation leadership into the future. The company’s key differentiators are built around three pillars — innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model.The company is focused on the next chapter of cloud, which will shift mission-critical work to the cloud and optimize everything from supply chains to core banking systems.  To address this opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services, and workflows across multiple clouds and on-premises. They also need to be able to address security concerns, data protection and protocols, availability, and cloud management.  This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach.  As a result, the company has been reshaping its business to address this opportunity, investing heavily to build capabilities. On July 9, 2019, the company closed the Red Hat acquisition. Due to the timing of the closing, the company has not updated full year expectations to include Red Hat or Red Hat related activity.  Full year expectations will be updated at an investor briefing webcast on August 2, 2019. Through the second quarter, the company remains on track to achieve GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2019 of at least $12.45. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.76 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $0.45 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.24 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is on track to be at least $13.90.  Earnings per share expectations do not include Red Hat or Red Hat related activity, other than pre-closing financing costs, which are included in GAAP results. The company remains on track to achieve free cash flow of approximately $12 billion in 2019. The free cash flow expectation also does not include estimated impacts from Red Hat.At closing, Red Hat shareholders were entitled to receive $190 per share in cash, which represented a total equity value of approximately $34 billion and was remitted to the paying agent. The company funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. The company previously announced its intent to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021. Upon closing of the Red Hat acquisition, the company suspended its share repurchase program, which was earlier than previously stated. With the strong free cash flow generated by the company, portfolio actions taken and the suspension of share repurchases, this positions IBM to return to its target leverage ratios within a couple of years. The company will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and supporting a solid and growing dividend.IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat brings together the best-in-class hybrid cloud providers and will enable companies to securely unlock the full value of cloud for their businesses. The company has been building hybrid cloud capabilities across the business to address the next chapter of cloud and to prepare for this important milestone.  IBM and Red Hat are strongly positioned to address this opportunity and accelerate hybrid cloud adoption. The acquisition of Red Hat reinforces IBM’s high-value model, combining the power and flexibility of Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud technologies with the scale and depth of IBM’s innovation and industry expertise, which is expected to elevate all of IBM as Red Hat grows and the company sells more software and services.         As previously stated, the company continues to expect the acquisition of Red Hat, including related activity to be accretive to free cash flow in the first year, and accretive to operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share by the end of the second year after closing.  Consistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments will result in the acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share expectations. In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition 93
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)date fair value. This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance. This will result in a non-cash adjustment to the acquired deferred revenue balance and a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment will reflect the high margin profile of Red Hat’s business, and deferred revenue is expected to be replenished over the subsequent two to three years, given Red Hat’s high renewal rates and a stable and growing client base.  Additional information will be provided when the company provides updated full-year 2019 expectations at the August 2nd briefing.​Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBM’s Global Financing business is winding down the portion of its commercial financing operations, which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers. This is consistent with IBM’s capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships. The wind down of this activity is expected to reduce IBM’s revenue, with a nominal impact to profit, however it does not change the company’s earnings per share and free cash flow expectations for 2019.Beginning in 2019, within the IBM U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan, substantially all the plan participants are now considered inactive, which, as required by U.S. GAAP, resulted in a change in the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses, from the average remaining service period of active plan participants to the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants. These periods are approximately 6 years and 18 years, respectively. As a result of this change, there will be a reduction to 2019 amortization expense of approximately $900 million. Actuarial loss amortization is reported within non-operating pension costs. There will be no impact to 2019 operating (non-GAAP) retirement-related costs, funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan. However, there will be an impact to free cash flow realization.The company expects 2019 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2018. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2018. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $1 billion compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower actuarial loss amortization resulting from the change in amortization period for the U.S. plan. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2019, approximately flat compared to 2018.Currency Rate FluctuationsChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar (USD) affect the company’s financial results and financial position. At June 30, 2019, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at year-end 2018. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the company’s financial results.The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first six months of 2019. Based on the currency rate movements in the first six months of 2019, total revenue decreased 4.4 94
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)percent as reported and 1.2 percent at constant currency versus the first six months of 2018. On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts mitigated by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $160 million in the first six months of 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $140 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $175 million in the first six months of 2018 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $200 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesIn the company’s 2018 Annual Report, on pages 60 to 62, there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that present three years of data. The table presented on page 60 includes net cash from operating activities, cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, and the size of the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past three years. For the six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2019, those amounts are $7.7 billion of net cash from operating activities, $46.4 billion of cash, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.The major rating agencies’ ratings on the company’s debt securities at June 30, 2019 appear in the following table: ​​​​​​​​​STANDARD​MOODY’S​    ​​AND​INVESTORS​FITCHIBM and IBM Credit LLC ratings:    POOR’S    SERVICE    RATINGSSenior long-term debt A A1 ACommercial paper A-1 Prime-1 F1​On July 9, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Red Hat for $190 per share in cash, representing a total value of approximately $34 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, the company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. Refer to note 13, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.       After closing the transaction, Moody’s, as expected, downgraded IBM and IBM Credit LLC’s long-term debt rating from A1 to A2 and improved its outlook to stable.  The commercial paper rating from Moody’s remains unchanged.  Standard and Poor’s ratings remain unchanged. Additionally, Fitch affirmed its rating before withdrawing coverage on IBM for commercial reasons. ​IBM will continue with a disciplined financial policy and is committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. The company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At June 30, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $589 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the 95
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.In July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.The company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 92. For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.The following is management’s view of cash flows for the first six months of 2019 and 2018 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above.​​​​​​​(Dollars in millions)​​​​​​For the six months ended June 30:    2019    2018Net cash from operating activities per GAAP​$ 7,700​$ 6,896Less: change in Global Financing receivables​  2,577​  1,778Net cash from operating activities, excluding Global Financing receivables​$ 5,123​$ 5,118Capital expenditures, net ​  (1,045)​  (1,897)Free cash flow (FCF) ​$ 4,078​$ 3,221Acquisitions​  (43)​  (122)Divestitures​  888​  —Share repurchase​  (1,236)​  (1,767)Common stock repurchases for tax withholdings​  (152)​  (143)Dividends​  (2,833)​  (2,819)Non-Global Financing debt​  33,399​  (611)Other (includes Global Financing net receivables and Global Financing debt)​  84​  1,325Change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities​$ 34,186​$ (916)​96
Table of ContentsManagement Discussion – (continued)In the first six months of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $4.1 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion versus the prior year. In the first six months of 2019, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $2.8 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in gross common stock repurchases (9.2 million shares).Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in the company’s 2018 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements, periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 14, “Contingencies,” in this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $400 million in 2019. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2019. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.In 2019, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.The company’s cash flows are sufficient to fund its current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, the company has several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing its committed global credit facilities.Global Financing Return on Equity Calculation​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​For Three Months Ended​For Six Months Ended​​​June 30,​June 30,​(Dollars in millions)​2019​2018    2019    2018 Numerator​​​​​​ ​   ​  ​Global Financing after-tax income*​$ 188​$ 272​$ 304​$ 556​Annualized after-tax income (1)​$ 754​$ 1,089​$ 608​$ 1,113​Denominator​   ​   ​   ​   ​Average Global Financing equity (2)**​$ 3,028​$ 3,486​$ 3,175​$ 3,485​Global Financing return on equity (1)/(2)​  24.9%    31.2%    19.2%    31.9%*    Calculated based upon an estimated tax rate principally based on Global Financing’s geographic mix of earnings as IBM’s provision for income taxes is determined on a consolidated basis.**  Average of the ending equity for Global Financing for the last two quarters and three quarters, for the three months ended June 30, and for the six months ended June 30, respectively. 97
