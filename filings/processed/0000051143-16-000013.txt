Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are
unaudited. In the opinion of the company's management, these statements include
all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to
present a fair statement of the company's results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.
 
      
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in
the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from
these estimates. Refer to the company's 2015 Annual Report on pages 64 to 67
for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
      
In January 2016, the company made a number of changes to its organizational
structure and management system. These changes impacted the company’s
reportable segments, but did not impact the company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements. Refer to note 6, “Segments,” on pages 26 to 27 for additional
information on the changes in reportable segments. The periods presented in
this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. The company intends to file
a revised 2015 Annual Report in a Form 8-K in the second quarter of 2016 to
reclassify its historical segment information to reflect these changes.      
 
       In the first quarter 2016, the company classified
certain properties, primarily office space, as held for sale. As a result of
the company's reassessment of its real estate portfolio, certain properties
were approved for sale and are being actively marketed.  The
sales are expected to be completed within twelve months. A pre-tax impairment
charge of $252 million was recorded to other income (expense) related to the
applicable land, buildings and furniture and fixtures. The pre-tax charge
reflected the difference between the net book value and the fair value
(estimated proceeds) less the estimated costs to sell the properties. The fair
value of these assets was not material at March 31, 2016. 
 
       In the first quarter of 2016, the company reported a
benefit from income taxes of $983 million, and its effective tax rate was
(95.1) percent. This was primarily driven by the resolution of a long-standing
non-U.S. tax matter in February 2016. See Taxes on pages 56 to 57 for
additional information.
 
       On
October 20, 2014, the company announced a definitive agreement to divest its
Microelectronics business and manufacturing operations to GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The
assets and liabilities of the Microelectronics business were reported as held
for sale at December 31, 2014, and the operating results of the
Microelectronics business have been reported as discontinued operations. The
transaction closed on July 1, 2015. Refer to note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,”
for additional information on the transaction. 
 
      
Noncontrolling interest amounts of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, net of tax,
for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are included
in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense
line item.
 
      
Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in
this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the company's 2015 Annual Report.

 
      
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows
may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.
Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. This is annotated where applicable.
  

 
2. Accounting
Changes:  
 
New Standards to be Implemented
 
       In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which changes the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. The guidance is effective January 1, 2017 and early
adoption is permitted.  The company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new guidance.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       In February 2016, the FASB issued
guidance which changes the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees
to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The guidance makes some changes
to lessor accounting and aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance.  The
guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to assess the
amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance
is effective January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance and the effective date. The company’s operating lease commitments were $6.4 billion
at December 31, 2015.  
 
        In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which
addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
financial instruments. Certain equity investments will be measured at fair
value with changes recognized in net income. The amendment also simplifies the
impairment test of equity investments that lack readily determinable fair
value. The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 and early adoption is not
permitted except for limited provisions. The guidance is not expected to have a
material impact in the consolidated financial results.     
 
         The FASB issued
guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May
2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of adoption:
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively
with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the
date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The
guidance was initially effective January 1, 2017 and early adoption was not
permitted. The amended guidance provides for a one-year deferral of the
effective date to January 1, 2018, with an option of applying the standard on
the original effective date. The company will adopt the guidance on January 1,
2018 and apply the cumulative catch-up transition method. The company is
continuing to evaluate the impact of the new guidance in the consolidated
financial results.
 
Standards Implemented
 
         In November 2015, the FASB issued
guidance which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as
noncurrent in the statement of financial position. The guidance was effective
January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The
company adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective
basis. The company reclassified current deferred tax assets of $2.0 billion at
December 31, 2014 to deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities
of $19 million at December 31,
2014 to other liabilities from other accrued expenses and liabilities in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. In order to offset deferred tax
assets and liabilities for presentation as a single noncurrent amount by tax
jurisdiction, the company also reclassified $178 million at December 31,
2014 from deferred tax assets to other liabilities in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.
 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance eliminating
the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for a
measurement-period adjustment retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will
recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which the amount
of the adjustment is determined. In addition, the portion of the amount
recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded
in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had
been recognized as of the acquisition date should be presented separately on
the face of the income statement or disclosed in the notes. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The guidance did not have a
material impact in the consolidated financial results.
 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance which removed the requirement to categorize within the fair value
hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset
value per share practical expedient. The amendments also removed the
requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible
to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has
elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The guidance
was effective January 1, 2016. The guidance was a change in disclosure only and
did not have an impact in the consolidated financial results.  
 
  In April 2015, the FASB
issued guidance about whether a cloud
computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for
the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition
of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a
software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a services
contract. All software licenses recognized under this guidance will be
accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and the company
adopted it on a prospective basis. The guidance did not have a material
impact in the consolidated financial results.

10



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which
requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The company adopted
the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis. The
company had debt issuance costs of $95 million and $74 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. Debt issuance costs were previously
included in investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.
 
3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
       The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 
       Certain financial assets
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity
method investments that are recognized at fair value at the measurement date to
the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale
equity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In
the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a financial investment, fair
value is measured using a model described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the
company recorded an impairment on certain 

11



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

assets that
are classified as held for sale. See note 1, “Basis of Presentation,” for
additional information. There were no material impairments of non-financial
assets for the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
 
       Accounting guidance permits the
measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting
standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied the fair
value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015.

       There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
 
Notes and other accounts receivable and
other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate
fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt
(excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities
with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in
the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.    
 
Loans and Long-term
Receivables
 
       Fair values are based on discounted future cash
flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with
similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the difference
between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term
receivables was immaterial. If
measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments
would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

 
Long-Term Debt
 
       Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is
based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an
asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market
price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates
currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $40,254 million and $33,428 million, and the estimated
fair value was $42,980 million and $35,220 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. If
measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including
the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities are
considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.  
 
       The following tables summarize the company’s

       During the
fourth quarter of 2014, the company acquired equity securities in conjunction
with the sale of the System x business which were classified as
available-for-sale securities. Based on an evaluation of available evidence as
of December 31, 2015, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment
loss of $86 million resulting in an adjusted cost basis of $185 million as of
December 31, 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, the company recorded a gross
realized loss of $37 million (before taxes) related to the sale of all the
outstanding shares. The loss on this sale was recorded in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
       Sales of debt and available-for-sale equity investments
during the period were as follows:

Derivative
Financial Instruments 
 
       The company operates in multiple
functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global
markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact
of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser
extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company
limits these risks by following established risk management policies and
procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective,
financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For
interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements
between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease and other
financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt.
Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these
collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015 was $166 million and $28 million, respectively, for which
no collateral was posted at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Full collateralization of these
agreements would be required in the event that the company’s credit rating
falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250
basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security
arrangements. The
aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions as of March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $1,129 million and $994 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This
exposure was reduced by $270 million and $139 million at March 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting
arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at March 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, this exposure was reduced by $131 million and $90 million of
cash collateral, and $71 million and $40 million of non-cash collateral in U.S.
Treasury securities, respectively, received by the company. At March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $657 million and $726
million, respectively.  At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net
exposure related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position was $191 million and $47 million,
respectively.  
 
       In the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against
liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or
payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair
values of the related derivative instruments. No amount was recognized
in other receivables at March 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015 for the right to
reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the
obligation to return cash collateral was $131 million and $90 million at March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash
collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in prepaid 

15



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position. No amount was
rehypothecated at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
 
       The company may employ derivative
instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders’ equity resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the
company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net
investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have
an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow
from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this
cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these
hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative
instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in
the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation
until maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts,
interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the
underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative
instruments.
 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk,
follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The company issues debt in the global
capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to
cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the
underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest
cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt
issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert
specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow
hedges). At March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of the company’s
interest rate swaps was $7.3 billion at both periods. The weighted-average
remaining maturity of these instruments at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015
was approximately 7.0 years and 7.2 years, respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The company is exposed to interest
rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may
use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest
payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges.
The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program
outstanding at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
       At
March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net gains of less than $1 million (before
taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings.
Within these amounts, less than $1 million of gains, respectively, are expected
to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying transactions.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large portion of the company’s
foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net
investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’
equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional
currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The
company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts
for this risk management purpose. At March 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of derivative instruments
designated as net investment hedges was $6.6 billion and $5.5 billion,
respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at
March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was approximately 0.2 years for both
periods.
 
Anticipated
Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The company’s operations generate significant
nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments
for royalties and goods and services among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries
and with the parent company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash
flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company
selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency
risk. These forward contracts are accounted 

16



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

for as
cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged
its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At March 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as
cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $8.2 billion
for both periods. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments
at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 0.7 years for both periods.
 
       At
March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, in connection with cash flow hedges of
anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net losses of
$193 million and net gains of $147 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $232
million of losses and $121 million of gains, respectively, are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 
 
Foreign
Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
       The company is exposed to exchange
rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the
company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency
denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of
the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows is approximately nine years. At March 31, 2016 the
total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of
foreign currency denominated debt was $1.4 billion. At December 31, 2015, no
amounts were outstanding under this program.
 
       At
March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, in connection with cash flow hedges of
foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $18
million and net losses of $2 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $19
million of gains and less than $1 million of losses, respectively, are expected
to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure.      
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The company uses its Global Treasury
Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use
currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition,
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a
net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s
nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and
swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values
of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally
offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.
At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $9.7
billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. 
 
Equity Risk
Management
 
       The company is exposed to market price
changes in certain broad market indices and in the company’s own stock
primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes
derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the
exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are
linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return
on the company’s common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or
losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. At March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.1
billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
       The company may hold warrants to
purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are
deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement
provisions. The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants
in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have
any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at March 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.
 
       The company is exposed to a potential
loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company
may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures.
The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains 

17



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

and
losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. The company
did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at
March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
       The company is exposed to market
volatility on certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or
forwards to economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2016 the
company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program
outstanding. At December 31, 2015 the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of investment securities was less than $0.1
billion.
 
       The
following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and
non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity as of March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

  
      For the three months ending March 31,
2016 and 2015, there were no significant gains or losses recognized in earnings
representing hedge ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness (for fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying
exposure that did not or was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor
are there any anticipated in the normal course of business.

Net investment in sales-type and
direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$627 million and $645 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of
$588 million and $536 million, and net of allowance
for credit losses of $246 million and $213 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $14 million and $19 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), net of allowance for
credit losses of $420 million and $377 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to
clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment
terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment financing contracts are priced
independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $600 million and $545 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding commercial financing receivables and
other miscellaneous financing receivables at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The company determines its allowance
for credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan
receivables, and further segments the portfolio into two classes: major markets
and growth markets.

       When determining the allowances,
financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective
basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the
expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential
loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is
probable, the company records a specific reserve. In addition, the company
records an unallocated reserve that is determined by applying a reserve rate to
its different portfolios, excluding accounts that have been specifically
reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.  
 
Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
        The following table presents the recorded investment in financing
receivables which were on non-accrual status at March 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit
quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available
information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically
based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical
rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service credit ratings as shown
below. The company uses information provided by Moody’s, where available, as
one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings.
 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Receivables with a credit quality
indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others
are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not
reflect mitigation actions that the company takes to transfer credit risk to
third parties.

5. Stock-Based
Compensation: Stock-based compensation cost is
measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized
over the employee requisite service period. The following table
presents total stock-based compensation cost included in income from continuing
operations.

        Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 increased $6 million compared to the corresponding period
in the prior year. This was due to increases related to performance share units
($12 million), conversion of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired
entities ($3 million) and stock options ($1 million), partially offset by
decreases related to restricted stock units ($10 million). 
 
       The amount of
stock-based compensation cost included in the loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was immaterial in both periods.
 
       As of March
31, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $777 million related to
non-vested awards was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.6 years.
 
       There was no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31, 2016 and
2015.
 
6. Segments: 
The table on page 27 reflects the results of continuing operations of the
company’s segments consistent with the management and measurement system
utilized within the company. Performance
measurement is based on operating pre-tax income from continuing operations.
These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker, both in
evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the
segments.
 
       In January 2016, the company made a
number of changes to its organizational structure and management system
consistent with its ongoing transformation to a cognitive solutions and cloud
platform business. With these changes, the company has revised its reportable
segments. The company continues to have five reportable segments as follows:
 
       The Cognitive Solutions segment
includes solutions units that address many of the company’s strategic areas,
including analytics, commerce and security, several of the new initiatives
around Watson, Watson Health, Watson Internet of Things and Transaction
Processing software. The Technology Services & Cloud Platforms segment
includes the company’s cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities, the Global
Technology Services business and Integration software. Operating systems
software has been aligned with the underlying hardware platforms in the Systems
segment. The Global Business Services and Global Financing segments remain
unchanged.
 
       The company also realigned a
portion of its software support revenue, which was previously managed and
reported in Integrated Technology Services within Global Technology Services,
to the underlying software product areas.  
 
       The following tables reflect these reclassifications
for the prior-year period.

     On March 24, 2014, the Supreme Court of Spain issued a ruling
against IBM Spain in litigation involving its defined benefit and defined
contribution plans. As a result of the ruling, the company recorded pre-tax
retirement-related obligations of $233 million in 2015 ($230 million in the first
quarter of 2015) in selling,
general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
These obligations are reflected in "Non-U.S. Plans - Multi-employer
plans/other costs" in the table above. 
 
       In
March 2016, the company initiated a change to the investment strategy of its
U.S. defined benefit plan. The 2016 target asset allocation was modified by
reducing equity securities from 34 percent to 21 percent, other investments
from 10 percent to 9 percent and increasing
debt securities from 56 percent to 70 percent of total plan
assets. This change is designed to reduce the risk associated with the
potential negative impact that equity markets might have on the funded status
of the U.S. defined benefit plan. The change is expected to reduce the 2017
expected long-term rate of return on assets from 7.00 percent to approximately 6.25 percent. See note S,
“Retirement-Related Benefits,” on page 135 in the company’s 2015 Annual Report
for additional information regarding the company’s investment strategy.
 
       In 2016, the company expects to contribute
approximately $500 million to its non-U.S.
defined benefit and multi-employer plans, the largest of which will be
contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in the UK and Japan. This
amount represents the legally mandated minimum contribution. Total net
contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first three months of 2016 were $107 million, of which $65 million was in cash and $42 million in U.S. Treasury
securities. The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a
non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

company contributed $100 million in U.S. Treasury
securities and $126 million in cash to the
U.S. nonpension postretirement benefit plan during the first quarter ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The contribution of U.S. Treasury
securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement

9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:  
 
Acquisitions:
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the company completed six
acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $2,642 million.
 
      
The Weather Company (TWC) – On January 29, 2016, the company completed
the acquisition of TWC’s B2B, mobile and cloud-based web-properties,
weather.com, Weather Underground, The Weather Company brand and WSI, its global
business-to-business brand, for cash consideration of $2,284 million. The cable
television segment was not acquired by IBM, but will license weather forecast
data and analytics from IBM under a long-term contract. TWC was a privately
held business. Goodwill of $1,723 million has been assigned to the Cognitive
Solutions segment. At the acquisition date, it was expected that none of the
goodwill would be deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted-average
useful life of the identified intangible assets acquired is 6.9 years.
 
Other Acquisitions – The Technology Services & Cloud Platforms
segment completed acquisitions of two businesses in the first quarter: Ustream,
Inc. (Ustream), a privately held business, and AT&T’s application and
hosting services business. Global Business Services (GBS) completed
acquisitions of three privately held businesses in the first quarter:
Resource/Ammirati, ecx.io and Optevia.
 
Each acquisition is expected to enhance the
company’s portfolio of product and services capabilities. Ustream provides
cloud-based video streaming to enterprises and broadcasters. Resource/Ammirati
is a leading U.S. based digital marketing and creative agency, addressing the
rising demand from businesses seeking to reinvent themselves for the digital
economy. Ecx.io will enhance IBM Interactive Experience (IBM iX) with new
digital marketing, commerce and platform skills to accelerate clients’ digital
transformations. Optevia is a Software-as-a Service systems integrator
specializing in CRM solutions for public sector organizations. The acquisition
of AT&T’s application and hosting services business is expected to
strengthen the company’s cloud portfolio. 
 
Purchase price consideration for all
acquisitions as reflected in the following table, was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
       The following table reflects the
purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price
allocations as of March 31, 2016.

        The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity were recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the 

32



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

synergies between the acquired businesses and IBM and the
acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify as an amortizable
intangible asset.  
 
       For the
“Other Acquisitions”, the overall weighted-average life of the identified
amortizable intangible assets acquired is 6.2 years. These identified intangible assets
will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill of $91 million
was assigned to the Technology Services & Cloud Platforms segment and
goodwill of $101 million was assigned to the GBS segment. It is expected that
40 percent of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.
 
       On
March 31, 2016, the company announced its intent to acquire Bluewolf Group LLC
(Bluewolf), a globally recognized leader in cloud consulting and implementation
services. Bluewolf will extend the company’s analytics, experience design and
industry consulting leadership with one of the world’s leading Salesforce
consulting practices to deliver differentiated, consumer-grade experiences via
the cloud. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 and the business will be integrated within the
GBS segment.
 
       On April 6, 2016, the company announced that it had
acquired Resilient Systems Inc. (Resilient), a provider of incident response
solutions. Resilient’s technology automates and orchestrates the many processes
needed when dealing with cyber incidents, from breaches to lost devices. The business will be integrated within the
Cognitive Solutions segment. 
 
       On
April 8, 2016, the company announced that it had acquired Truven Health
Analytics (Truven), a leading provider of healthcare analytics solutions, for
cash consideration of $2.6 billion. Truven has developed proprietary analytic
methods and assembled analytic content assets, creating extensive national
healthcare utilization, performance, quality, and cost data. The business will be integrated within the Cognitive
Solutions segment.
 
       On April
19, 2016, the company announced that it had acquired Aperto, a digital agency
with headquarters in Berlin, Germany. Aperto will join the IBM iX team. IBM iX
provides clients a unique fusion of services spanning strategy, analytics and
systems integration for scalable digital, commerce, mobile and wearable
platforms. The business will be
integrated within the GBS segment.
 
       At the
date of issuance of the financial statements, the initial purchase accounting
for the Resilient, Truven and Aperto transactions was not complete.


Divestitures: 
 
        Microelectronics – On October 20,
2014, IBM and GLOBALFOUNDRIES announced a definitive agreement in which
GLOBALFOUNDRIES would acquire the company’s Microelectronics business,
including existing semiconductor manufacturing assets and operations in East
Fishkill, NY and Essex Junction, VT. The commercial OEM business acquired by
GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes custom logic and specialty foundry, manufacturing and
related operations. The transaction closed on July 1, 2015.
 
       The transaction includes a 10-year
exclusive manufacturing sourcing agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES will
provide server processor semiconductor technology for use in IBM Systems. The
agreement provides the company with capacity and market-based pricing for
current semiconductor nodes in production and progression to nodes in the
future for both development and production needs. As part of the transaction,
the company will provide GLOBALFOUNDRIES with certain transition services,
including IT, supply chain, packaging and test services and lab services. The
initial term for these transition services is one to three years, with
GLOBALFOUNDRIES having the ability to renew. 
 
In the third quarter of 2014, the company
recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.7 billion related to the sale of the
Microelectronics disposal group, which was part of the Systems reportable
segment. The pre-tax charge reflected the fair value less the estimated cost of
selling the disposal group including an impairment to the semiconductor
long-lived assets of $2.4 billion, $1.5 billion representing the cash
consideration expected to be transferred to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and $0.8 billion of
other related costs. Additional pre-tax charges of $116 million were recorded
during 2015 related to the disposal, and a pre-tax credit of $1 million was
recorded during the first three months of 2016. The cumulative pre-tax charge
was $4.8 billion as of March 31, 2016. Additional charges may be recorded in
future periods. 
 
       All assets and liabilities of the
business, classified as held for sale at June 30, 2015, were transferred at
closing. The company transferred $515 million of net cash to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in
the third quarter of 2015. This amount included $750 million of cash
consideration, adjusted by the amount of working capital due from
GLOBALFOUNDRIES and other miscellaneous items. The remaining cash consideration
will be transferred over two years.
 

33



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       Reporting the related assets and
liabilities initially as held for sale at September 30, 2014 was based on
meeting all of the criteria for such reporting in the applicable accounting
guidance. While the company met certain criteria for held for sale reporting in
prior periods, it did not meet all of the criteria until September 30, 2014. In
addition, at September 30, 2014, the company concluded that the
Microelectronics business met the criteria for discontinued operations
reporting. The disposal group constitutes a component under accounting
guidance. The continuing cash inflows and outflows with the discontinued
component are related to the manufacturing sourcing arrangement and the
transition, packaging and test services. These cash flows are not direct cash
flows as they are not significant and the company will have no significant
continuing involvement. 
 
Summarized financial information for
discontinued operations is shown in the table below.

Industry Standard Server – On
January 23, 2014, IBM and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) announced a
definitive agreement in which Lenovo would acquire the company’s industry
standard server portfolio (System x) for an adjusted purchase price of $2.1
billion, consisting of approximately $1.8 billion in cash, with the balance in
Lenovo common stock. The stock represented less than 5 percent equity ownership
in Lenovo. The company would sell to Lenovo its System x, BladeCenter and Flex
System blade servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale
and iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and maintenance
operations.
 
IBM and Lenovo entered into a strategic
relationship which included a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales of
IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems, tape
storage systems, General Parallel File System software, SmartCloud Entry
offering, and elements of IBM’s system software, including Systems Director and
Platform Computing solutions. Effective with the initial closing of the
transaction, Lenovo assumed related customer service and maintenance
operations. IBM will continue to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s
behalf for an extended period of time. In addition, as part of the transaction
agreement, the company will provide Lenovo with certain transition services,
including IT and supply chain services. The initial term for these transition
services ranges from less than one year to three years. Lenovo can renew
certain services for an additional year.
 
       The initial closing was completed on October 1,
2014. A subsequent closing occurred in most other countries in which there was
a large business footprint on December 31, 2014. The remaining countries closed on March 31, 2015. An assessment of the ongoing contractual terms
of the transaction resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $63 million
in 2015 and $29 million in the first quarter of 2016.
 
Overall, the company expects to
recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.6 billion, which does not include associated costs related to
transition and performance-based costs. Net of these charges, the pre-tax gain
was approximately $1.3 billion, of which the cumulative gain recorded as of
March 31, 2016 is $1.2 billion. The balance of
the gain is expected to be recognized in 2019 upon conclusion of the
maintenance agreement.
 
       Customer Care – On
September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a definitive agreement in which
SYNNEX would acquire the company’s worldwide customer care business process
outsourcing services business for $501 million, consisting of approximately
$430 million in cash, net of balance sheet adjustments, and $71 million in
SYNNEX common stock, which represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in
SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered into a multi-year agreement
with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s outsourcing business, became an IBM
strategic business partner for global customer care business process
outsourcing services. 
 
       The initial closing was completed on January 31,
2014, with subsequent closings occurring during 2014. For the full year of 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax
gain of $202 million related to this transaction. 
 

34



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       In  the second quarter of 2015, resolution of
the final balance sheet adjustments was concluded. An
assessment of the ongoing contractual terms of the transaction resulted in the
recognition of a pre-tax gain of $7 million in 2015. Through March 31,
2016, the cumulative pre-tax gain attributed to this transaction was $209
million.
 
       Others ‒ In
the first quarter of 2016, the company completed four software product-related divestitures.
The financial terms related to these transactions were not material. Overall,
the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $36 million related to these
transactions in the first three months of 2016.

* Other intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and
nonproprietary business processes, methodologies and systems.  
 
       The net carrying amount of intangible assets
increased $886 million during the first
quarter of 2016, primarily due to intangible asset additions resulting from
acquisitions, partially offset by amortization. The aggregate intangible
amortization expense was $347 million and $298 million for the quarters ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, in the first three months
of 2016, the company retired $163 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.  
 
       The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following
at March 31, 2016:

      In
January 2016, the company made a number of changes to its organizational
structure and management system consistent with the ongoing transformation to a
cognitive solutions and cloud platform business. With these changes, the
company revised its reportable segments. Goodwill was reallocated to the new
reporting segments, and as a result, an impairment assessment was performed. There
were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the first three months of
2016 or the full year of 2015 and the company has no accumulated impairment
losses. For further information regarding the segment change, refer to note 6,
“Segments”. 
 
      Purchase
price adjustments recorded in the first three months of 2016 and full year 2015
were related to acquisitions that were completed on or prior to December 31,
2015 or December 31, 2014, respectively, and were still subject to the
measurement period that ends at the earlier of 12 months from the acquisition
date or when information becomes available. Purchase price adjustments of $4
million were recorded in the first three months of 2016 related to various
asset and liability adjustments.

*      The portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt obligations
that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
as an amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying value plus a fair value
adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt
obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates.
 
       The company’s indenture governing its debt securities
and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which
obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the
aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10 percent of the company’s
consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge
or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also
include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio,
which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 
       The company is in compliance with all of its
significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders.
The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of
default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain
events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to
which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.

12.  Contingencies:   As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries,
IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a
leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will
continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated
products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement
and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company
enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations,
lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and
scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions
involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters
related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may
involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel
questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters
arise.
 
        The company records a provision with
respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Any
recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter
ended March 31, 2016 were not material to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
      
  In accordance with the relevant
accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the
likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the
company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and
qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the
industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.
 
       With
respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any
material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court
rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With
respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed in this Note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is
unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses,
including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following
reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters. It is the company’s experience that damage amounts claimed in
litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as
such are not meaningful indicators of the company’s potential liability.
Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of
other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in
question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing
discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company
reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and
decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and
disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in
the aggregate), to reflect the impact 

38



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

and status of
settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews
by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter.
 
       Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the
Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of
the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the
company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of
these matters.
 
       The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.
 
       The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in
Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux
and the company has asserted counterclaims. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff
filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed.
The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in
March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare
copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize
Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX
license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In
June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v.
IBM case. In February 2016, the Federal Court ruled in favor of IBM on all of
SCO’s remaining claims, and in March 2016, SCO filed a notice of appeal to the
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.   
 
On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on
behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one
another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social
service program processing in Indiana. After six weeks of trial, on July 18,
2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the State’s claims
in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On
February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed portions of the trial
judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and ordered the case remanded
to the trial judge to determine the State's damages, if any. The Indiana Court
of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial court's award
of damages to IBM. On March 22, 2016, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the
outcome of the Indiana Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the Indiana
Superior Court.
 
On April 16, 2014, Iusacell SA de C.V. (Iusacell) sued IBM,
claiming that IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations that induced Iusacell to
enter into an agreement with IBM Mexico. Iusacell claims damages for lost
profits. Iusacell’s complaint relates to a contractual dispute in Mexico, which
is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico initiated by IBM
Mexico against Iusacell for breach of the underlying agreement.   On November
14, 2014, the District Court in the Southern District of New York granted IBM's
motion to stay Iusacell's action against the company pending the arbitration in
Mexico between Iusacell and IBM Mexico.
 
IBM United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal
proceedings in May 2010 before the High Court in London against the IBM UK
Pensions Trust (the UK Trust) and two representative beneficiaries of the UK
Trust membership. IBM UK is seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully both
in notifying the Trustee of the UK Trust that it was closing its UK defined
benefit plans to future accruals for most participants and in implementing the
company’s new retirement policy. In April 2014, the High Court acknowledged
that the changes made to its UK defined benefit plans were within IBM’s
discretion, but ruled that IBM breached its implied duty of good faith both in
implementing these changes and in the manner in which it consulted with
employees. Proceedings to determine remedies were held in July 2014, and in
February 2015 the High Court held that for IBM to make changes to accruals
under the plan would require a new consultation of the participants, but other
changes (including to early retirement policy) would not require such
consultation. IBM UK has appealed both the breach and remedies judgments. If
the appeal is unsuccessful, the Court’s rulings would require IBM to reverse
the changes made to the UK defined benefit plans retroactive to their effective
dates. This could result in an estimated non-operating one-time pre-tax charge
of approximately $250 million, plus ongoing defined benefit related accruals. 
In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290 individual actions
brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined benefits plans who left
IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive dismissal and age
discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       In March 2011, the company announced  that it had
agreed to settle a civil enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) relating to alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA). On July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011
settlement and required that for a two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC
and the court on certain matters, including those relating to compliance with
the FCPA. The two-year period expired in July 2015. In early 2012, IBM notified
the SEC of an investigation by the Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau
involving allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM Poland employee in
connection with sales to the Polish government. IBM is cooperating with the SEC
and Polish authorities in this matter. In April 2013, IBM learned that the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating allegations related to the
Poland matter, as well as allegations relating to transactions in Argentina,
Bangladesh and Ukraine. The DOJ is also seeking information regarding the
company's global FCPA compliance program and its public sector business. The
company is cooperating with the DOJ in this matter. 
 
        In March 2015,
putative class action litigation was commenced in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York related to the company's October
2014 announcement that it was divesting its global commercial semiconductor
technology business. The company and three of its officers are named as
defendants. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated Sections 20(a) and 10(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In May 2015,
a related putative class action was also commenced in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York based on the same
underlying facts, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. The company, management’s Retirement Plans Committee, and three
current or former IBM executives are named as defendants.
 
      
 In August 2015, IBM learned that the SEC is
conducting an investigation relating to revenue recognition with respect to the
accounting treatment of certain transactions in the U.S., UK and Ireland. The
company is cooperating with the SEC in this matter.
 
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in,
proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA),
known as “Superfund,” or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require
potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities
regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting
environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity
of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits,
administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental
agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or
former operating sites.
 
The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and
governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S.
companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various
challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments
and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to
these matters for all applicable years is approximately $520 million. The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a
meaningful indicator of liability.
 
13. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $6,014 million and $5,477 million at March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available
to the company’s business partners to support their working capital needs. In
addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients
in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $2,069 million
and $2,097 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
 
       The company has applied the guidance
requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the
likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The following is a
description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the
assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the
company’s payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the
company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by
the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to 

40



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

the conditional nature of the company’s
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements
have not had a material effect on the company’s business, financial condition
or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $32 million and $34 million at March 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.

14. Subsequent
Events: On April 26, 2016, the company announced that the Board of
Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.40 per common share. The dividend
is payable June 10, 2016 to shareholders of record on May 10, 2016. The
dividend declaration represents an increase of $0.10 per common share, which is
8 percent higher than the prior quarterly dividend of $1.30 per common share.

Organization of Information:
 
      
In January 2016, the company made a number of changes to its organizational
structure and management system. These changes impacted the company’s reportable
segments, but did not impact the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Refer to note 6, “Segments,” on pages 26 to 27 for additional information on
the changes in reportable segments. The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are
reported on a comparable basis. The company intends to file a revised 2015
Annual Report in a Form 8-K in the second quarter of 2016 to reclassify its
historical segment information to reflect these changes.
 
       In October 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business. The assets and
liabilities of the Microelectronics business were reported as held for sale at
December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. The operating results of the
Microelectronics business are reported as discontinued operations. The
transaction closed on July 1, 2015.  
 
Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on pages 62 and 63 for additional information.

Management Discussion –

Operating (non-GAAP)
Earnings:
 
        In an effort to provide better transparency into the
operational results of the business, the company separates business results
into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing
operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain
acquisition-related charges, retirement-related costs, discontinued operations
and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings exclude the
amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable
restructuring and related expenses and tax charges related to acquisition
integration. For retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain
items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes defined
benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost,
amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans
in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost includes defined
benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected
return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any
plan curtailments/settlements and multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency
costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily
related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to
financial market performance and the company considers these costs to be
outside the operational performance of the business.
 
       Overall, the company believes that providing
investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides
increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the
business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves
visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational
performance; enables better comparisons to peer companies; and allows the
company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The
company’s reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from
continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement
system.
 
      
 The following table provides the company’s (non-GAAP)
operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015.

Financial
Performance Summary – Three Months Ended March 31:
 
       In the first quarter of 2016, the company delivered
$18.7 billion in revenue, $2.0 billion in income from continuing operations and
$2.3 billion in operating (non-GAAP) earnings, resulting in diluted earnings
per share from continuing operations of $2.09 as reported and $2.35 on an
operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $5.6 billion in cash from
operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter of 2016
driving shareholder returns of $2.2 billion in gross common stock repurchases
and dividends. The company made significant investments in the first quarter
and took significant actions to accelerate its transformation and shift the
business into new markets.
 
       Total consolidated revenue decreased 4.6 percent as
reported and 2 percent year to year adjusted for currency in the first quarter
of 2016 consistent with performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 on an
adjusted basis.  
 
       Enterprise clients are looking for greater value
from their data and IT environments. They are looking to become digital
enterprises that are differentiated by cognitive, using data to improve
decision making and outcomes. The company’s strategy is based on the point of
view that solving clients’ needs requires solutions, industry expertise, and
innovative technology, all supported by leading edge skills. The company has
been making significant changes to its business by transforming existing
businesses, building new markets and addressing new opportunity areas. The
company is creating cognitive solutions that join digital business with digital
intelligence, bringing its industry expertise together with these cognitive
solutions, and building it all on cloud platforms. The company is in a unique
position to move its clients to the future as it’s already running

their most critical business processes. The company has
continued its acceleration of shifting investments and resources to be more
aligned with its strategy.    
        
       In the first quarter of 2016, the company had
continued strong double-digit growth in the strategic imperatives, which
includes cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security solutions, with revenue
growth of 14 percent year to year as reported and 17 percent adjusted for
currency. Revenue performance was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2015 on
a constant currency basis and continued to outpace the market growth. Over the
past 12 months, the strategic imperatives generated $29.8 billion in revenue,
which represents approximately 37 percent of the company’s total revenue, an
increase of 2 points from full-year 2015. Total Cloud revenue of $2.6 billion
increased 34 percent as reported in the first quarter and 36 percent adjusted
for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 42 percent as reported (46 percent
adjusted for currency). The company exited the first quarter of 2016 with an
annual run rate for as-a-Service revenue of $5.4 billion. Analytics revenue of
$4.2 billion in the first quarter increased 7 percent as reported and 9 percent
year to year adjusted for currency. Security revenue increased 18 percent as
reported (20 percent adjusted for currency) and mobile revenue increased 88
percent (93 percent adjusted for currency). The company continues to invest and
add capabilities to buildout its cognitive and cloud platforms. In the first
quarter, the company:
 
  ·  Completed or announced several
acquisitions which enhance its existing capabilities in cloud video services,
cloud consulting and digital experience and added new capabilities, including
the digital assets of The Weather Company and further expansion into healthcare
with the Truven acquisition. 

·     Entered
into key partnerships to accelerate adoption of enterprise hybrid clouds.
 
·      Expanded the build, use and deployment of Watson.


       From a segment perspective, Cognitive Solutions
revenue declined 1.7 percent as reported, but increased 0.4 percent adjusted
for currency, with growth in Solutions Software mitigated by a decline in
Transaction Processing Software. Global Business Services (GBS) revenue
decreased 4.3 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency, driven
by declines in Consulting. GBS strategic imperatives revenue increased 19
percent as reported and 22 percent at constant currency with strong growth in
the cloud, analytics, mobility and security practices. Technology Services
& Cloud Platforms revenue declined 1.5 percent as reported, but increased 2
percent adjusted for currency, led by Infrastructure Services. Strategic
imperatives grew 41 percent as reported and 45 percent adjusted for currency,
driven by cloud revenue. Systems revenue decreased 21.8 percent as reported and
21 percent adjusted for currency, primarily reflecting the z Systems product
cycle. 
 
  From a geographic perspective, Americas
revenue decreased 6.9 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency.
Performance was consistent sequentially compared with the fourth quarter of
2015 on an adjusted for currency basis, with improvement in the U.S. and a
decline in Latin America driven by Brazil. EMEA revenue decreased 3.6 percent
(1 percent adjusted for currency) and Asia Pacific revenue decreased 0.7
percent as reported, but increased 1 percent adjusted for currency. 
  
  The consolidated gross profit margin
of 46.5 percent decreased 1.8 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP)
gross margin of 47.5 percent also decreased 1.8 points compared to the prior
year primarily driven by higher levels of investment and a mix impact within
the segments. Margin declines in Cognitive Solutions, Technology Services &
Cloud Platforms and GBS, were partially offset by margin improvement in Systems
consistent with the product cycle dynamics in z Systems and improvements in
Power and Storage.
 
       Total
expense and other (income) increased 18.6 percent in the first quarter of 2016
compared to the prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other
(income) increased 24.2 percent year to year. In the first quarter of 2016 the
company took significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its
workforce and shift its skill base to new areas, and also to improve its
structure primarily outside the U.S. The increased expense was primarily driven
by charges for these actions. The key year-to-year drivers were approximately:

       The increase in base expense was driven primarily by
a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges of $998 million in the first
quarter of 2016 compared to $285 million in the first quarter of 2015 to
accelerate the company’s transformation, charges in the first quarter of 2016
for real estate actions of $328 million and actions taken to reposition the
company’s business in Latin America. The increase in operating (non-GAAP)
expense was driven primarily by the same factors. The company is continuing to
shift resources and spending within its operational expense base, driving
productivity and efficiency while increasing investment in support of the
strategic imperatives. 
 
       Pre-tax
income from continuing operations of $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2016
decreased 65.6 percent year to year and the pre-tax margin was 5.5 percent, a
decrease of 9.8 points. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the
first quarter of 2016 was (95.1) percent compared to an effective tax rate of
19.5 percent in the first quarter of 2015. The negative tax rate in the first
quarter of 2016 is primarily the result of a refund ($1.0 billion) of
previously paid non-U.S. taxes, plus interest. Income from continuing
operations of $2.0 billion decreased 16.5 percent and the net income margin was
10.8 percent, a decrease of 1.5 points versus the first quarter of 2015. Losses
from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $3 million in the first quarter
of 2016 compared to $88 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net income of
$2.0 billion decreased 13.5 percent year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax
income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion decreased 62.3 percent year
to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations
decreased 11.2 points to 7.3 percent. The charges for actions to accelerate the
transformation of the company’s business impacted operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax
income from continuing operations by $1.5 billion and pre-tax margin by 8
points in the quarter. These charges also impacted as-reported pre-tax income
and pre-tax margin. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of
$2.3 billion decreased 21.4 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) income margin
from continuing operations of 12.1 percent decreased 2.6 points. The operating
(non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the first quarter
of 2016 was (66.8) percent versus 20.0 percent in the prior year. The first
quarter of 2016 profit and margin performance reflects the actions taken to
transform the business while improving the company’s position for the future. 
 
  Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations of $2.09 in the first quarter of 2016 decreased 14.3
percent year to year. In the first quarter of 2016, the company repurchased 6.6
million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.9 billion. Operating
(non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.35 decreased 19.2 percent versus
the first quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued
operations was ($0.00) in the first quarter of 2016 compared to ($0.09) in the
first quarter of 2015.
 
  At March 31, 2016, the company
continued to have the financial flexibility to support the business over the
long term. Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $14.9 billion, an
increase of $6.7 billion from December 31, 2015. Key drivers in the
balance sheet and total cash flows were:
 
 Total assets increased $8.4 billion
($6.1 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2015 driven by:
 
  ·   Increases in
cash ($6.7 billion), goodwill ($2.3 billion), acquired intangible assets ($0.9
billion) and pension
    assets ($0.6 billion); partially offset by
 
  ·    Decreases in
total receivables ($2.6 billion).
 
Total liabilities increased $7.7 billion
($5.6 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2015 driven by:
 
  ·     Increases in total
debt ($5.7 billion), deferred income ($1.5 billion) and workforce accruals
($0.9 billion); 
    partially offset by 
 
·      Decreases
in accounts payable ($0.7 billion) and income taxes ($0.6 billion). 
 
Total equity of $15.1 billion increased
$0.6 billion from December 31, 2015 as a result of:



45



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

  ·     Higher retained earnings ($0.8 billion) and lower
accumulated other comprehensive losses ($0.6 billion);
    partially offset by 
 
  ·     Increased
treasury stock ($0.9 billion). 
 
      The company generated $5.6 billion in cash flow
provided by operating activities, an increase of $2.0 billion when compared to
the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by lower income tax payments.
Investing activities was a use of cash of $2.0 billion in the first quarter of
2016 compared to a $0.6 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2015.
This year-to-year decrease in cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in
net cash used for acquisitions ($2.4 billion) in the key areas of Watson
Internet of Things, cloud, digital design and analytics. Financing activities
provided $2.8 billion of cash flow in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a
use of cash of $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015. This year-to-year
increase in cash flow was primarily driven by higher net debt issuances ($6.3
billion).
 
       In April 2016, the company disclosed that it now
expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be at least
$12.35 and continues to expect operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.50
per diluted share for 2016. In addition, the company updated its outlook and
now expects 2016 free cash flow to be at the high end of the $11 billion to $12
billion range. Refer to the Looking Forward section on pages 61 and 62 for
additional information on the company’s expectations.

       Cognitive Solutions revenue of
$3,979 million decreased 1.7 percent as reported, but increased 0.4 percent
year to year adjusted for currency. While Solutions Software grew year to year,
it was offset by a decline in Transaction Processing Software.
 
       Solutions Software addresses many
of the company’s strategic areas including analytics, security and social.
Analytics is the largest part of the Solutions portfolio and includes the
traditional analytics platform, industry solutions, commerce and Watson related
businesses. In the first quarter, Solutions Software revenue of $2,691 million
grew 1.4 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency driven by
strong double-digit growth (adjusted for currency) in cloud-based offerings
leveraging Watson and from acquisitions. This performance represents
significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2015. From an
offering perspective, the first-quarter growth was led
by security and analytics solutions. In both of these areas, the company
has highly differentiated strategies and capabilities. Momentum continued in
the first quarter of 2016 with high single-digit growth adjusted for currency
in security software, outpacing the market. The company continues to invest to
build its security platform, including recent acquisitions such as Resilient
Systems, which provides leading incident response capabilities and expands the
company’s overall leadership in security. The company’s approach to analytics
is also unique and differentiated, building on an industrial-strength cognitive
platform that is cloud-based and leverages Watson. It is also supported by
industry-specific data to help provide new insights in key industries. Watson
Healthcare further expands the company’s revenue opportunities through targeted
industry focus. In the past 12 months, the company has invested $4 billion in
four acquisitions in this industry. In early April, the Truven acquisition
closed, which brings more than 8,500 clients to the Watson Health portfolio. 
 
       Transactions Processing Software of
$1,287 million declined 7.6 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for
currency in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. This software
primarily runs mission critical systems in industries such as banking, airlines
and retail. It includes certain offerings running on z Systems, which were
primarily reflected in Other Middleware in the previously reported Software
segment. Most of this software is on-premises and annuity in nature, which is
not a growing part of the software opportunity.
 
      Within Cognitive Solutions, total
first-quarter strategic imperatives revenue of $2,473 million grew 2.2 percent
as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency year to year. Within the
strategic imperatives, Cloud revenue of $402 million grew 32.1 percent as
reported and 34 percent adjusted for currency, with an as-a-Service exit run
rate of $1,154 million.

       The
Cognitive Solutions gross profit margin decreased 2.5 points to 82.0 percent in
the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. The margin was impacted
by a lower level of transactional revenue and higher cloud-based content.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       Pre-tax income of $1,013 million decreased 33.7
percent and pre-tax margin declined 10.8 points to 21.8 percent. This
performance reflects a higher level of investments in areas such as the Watson
Platform, Health and Internet of Things, currency impact and the year to year
impact of the workforce rebalancing charges. In the first quarter of 2016,
there were $231 million of charges primarily related to workforce rebalancing
and real estate actions compared to $44 million of workforce rebalancing charges
in the prior year period.

       In the first quarter of 2016, Global Business
Services revenue of $4,131 million decreased 4.3 percent as reported and 2
percent adjusted for currency as the company continues to shift away from
traditional businesses, such as ERP, to more strategic areas. Application
Management, which represents 47 percent of GBS revenue, continued to have
relatively stable performance in the first quarter consistent with the prior
year. The ongoing shift to new areas in Consulting continued to impact
year-to-year growth rates.
 
       Consulting revenue of $1,835 million declined 5.7
percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency, with sequential
improvement compared to the prior quarter. Application Management revenue of
$1,949 million decreased 3.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for
currency compared to the prior year. Global Process Services revenue of $348
million decreased 3.4 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency.
The company expanded its digital design capabilities with three acquisitions in
the first quarter, that will be integrated into the IBM Interactive Experience,
the largest global digital agency, and expanded skills in other areas. The
company announced its intent to acquire Bluewolf, which will extend GBS’s industry
consulting leadership with one of the world’s leading Salesforce consulting
practices. The company’s Apple partnership continues to redesign workflows and
drive productivity for clients.
 
       Within GBS, total first quarter strategic imperatives
revenue of $1,991 million grew 19.3 percent as reported and 22 percent adjusted
for currency year to year.  In the first quarter, the strategic imperatives
generated nearly 50 percent of the total GBS segment revenue, with strong
growth across cloud, analytics, mobility and security practices. Within the
strategic imperatives, Cloud revenue of $550 million grew 53.5 percent as
reported and 55 percent adjusted for currency, with an as-a-Service exit run
rate of $493 million.

       The GBS gross profit margin decreased 1.6 points to
25.8 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year as the
company continues to invest to drive its transformation, strategically shifting
resources to higher value services which is impacting margin. Continued price
and profit pressure in certain parts of the portfolio is also impacting margin.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       Pre-tax income of $190 million decreased 67.7
percent and pre-tax margin declined 8.7 points to 4.5 percent. This performance
not only reflects the impact of the investment made in new areas, such as
digital, but also includes the impacts of structural actions, including
workforce rebalancing taken this quarter which will help progress the
transformation in GBS. In the first quarter of 2016, there were $328 million of
charges primarily related to workforce rebalancing and real estate actions
compared to $52 million of workforce rebalancing charges in the prior year
period.

       Technology Services & Cloud Platforms revenue of
$8,424 million decreased 1.5 percent as reported, but grew 2 percent adjusted
for currency in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year.
Infrastructure Services revenue of $5,626 million grew 0.2 percent as reported
and 4 percent adjusted for currency. This includes the company’s previous
Strategic Outsourcing and Integrated Technology Services lines. Technical
Support Services revenue of $1,786 million decreased 5.1 percent as reported
and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Integration Software revenue of $1,012
million decreased 4.5 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency.
 
       In Infrastructure Services, hybrid cloud solutions
provide value to enterprises as they enable new business models while
leveraging existing systems and data. In the first quarter, clients continued
to turn to the company as the trusted partner to modernize their most critical
IT systems and move them to hybrid. There was also continued strong momentum in
SoftLayer which again grew at strong double digits adjusted for currency this
quarter as the company continues to invest to build out its global capability.
In the first quarter, there was also continued expansion of cloud capabilities
with the acquisition of Ustream and the formation of the IBM Cloud Video
Services Unit that will provide clients with a powerful portfolio of video
services and digital analytics.  
 
       In Integration Software, the company is
cloud-enabling the portfolio to make it easy for clients to unlock large
investments in existing data and application systems. It was recently announced
that 100 percent of the company’s relevant software is now available in the
cloud through a series of offerings, such as WebSphere Connect, and that
several important strategic partnerships have been formed as the company
continues to build out its ecosystem. Annuity content in Integration Software
is growing, with stability in on-premises content and acceleration in the
adoption of SaaS, specifically in the products that integrate a hybrid cloud
environment. 
 
       Within Technology Services & Cloud Platforms,
total first quarter strategic imperatives revenue of $1,848 million grew 41.2
percent as reported and 45 percent adjusted for currency year to year driven by
hybrid cloud infrastructure engagements. Within the strategic imperatives,
Cloud revenue of $1,173 million grew 46.0 percent as reported and 50 percent
adjusted for currency with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $3,717 million.

       The Technology Services & Cloud Platforms gross
profit margin decreased 1.1 points to 40.9 percent in the first quarter of 2016
compared to the prior year, with year-to-year declines in both Technology
Services and Integration Software.  Margin was impacted by the revenue trajectory
of Integration Software as more of the portfolio moves to an as-a-Service model
delivered through the cloud and, within Integration Services, the company is
investing to contemporize clients’ IT systems as it signs new contracts. Gross
profit detail is provided within this segment for additional information due to
the new alignment of software content into this segment beginning this quarter.

 
       
Pre-tax income of $258 million decreased 77.2 percent and pre-tax margin
declined 10.0 points to 3.0 percent driven by workforce transformational
actions taken during the quarter, continued investment to build out platforms
such as Bluemix and SoftLayer and currency impacts. In the first quarter of
2016, there were $695 million of charges primarily related to workforce
rebalancing and real estate actions compared to $169 million of workforce
rebalancing charges in the prior year period.

       The estimated total services backlog at March
31, 2016 was $122 billion, a decrease of 0.2 percent as reported and 1 percent
adjusted for currency compared to the March 31, 2015 balance.  Global
Technology Services, within the Technology Services & Cloud Platforms
segment, grew 1.6 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. GBS
declined 4.4 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency, which is
a reflection of the company’s shift from large ERP implementations to the new
strategic opportunities.
 
       Total services backlog includes Infrastructure
Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and
Technical Support Services. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of
overall work under contract and therefore includes Technical Support Services. It
does not include as-a-Service offerings given the flexibility in contractual
commitment terms provided to these clients. Backlog estimates are subject to
change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in
the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not
materialized and adjustments for currency.
        
Services signings are management’s initial
estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract. There
are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of
signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments
to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration
of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.
 

50



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

Signings
include Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and
Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope
are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Technical
Support Services is not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to
be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals.
 
Contract portfolios purchased in an
acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those
contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing
will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or
coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       In the
first quarter of 2016, Systems revenue of $1,675 million decreased 21.8 percent
as reported and 21 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.
Systems Hardware revenue of $1,235 million decreased 25.5 percent as reported
and 25 percent adjusted for currency primarily reflecting the z Systems product
cycle. Operating Systems Software revenue of $440 million decreased 9.1 percent
as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency.
 
       Within
Systems Hardware, z Systems decreased 43.4 percent as reported and 42 percent
adjusted for currency compared to the first quarter of 2015. This is attributed
to strong performance in the prior year when the z13 mainframe was launched and
revenue grew 118.4 percent as reported (130 percent adjusted for currency).  
 
       After
four consecutive quarters of constant currency growth, Power Systems decreased
14.4 percent as reported and 14 percent adjusted for currency in the first
quarter of 2016. This is attributed to the strong performance in Unix-based
entry system in the prior-year period. In the first quarter, there was
continued momentum in Linux offerings and expansion of the company’s Open POWER
efforts. There was focus on the growth of Power-based Linux systems which have
now grown to about 10 percent of the overall Power Systems revenue base. There
was also continued traction with the OpenPOWER foundation-based innovations.
 
       Storage Systems revenue decreased
6.7 percent as reported and 6 percent adjusted for currency in the first
quarter compared to the prior year reflecting continued weakness in the overall
storage market. However, the company is well positioned to capture the
strategic growth areas of Flash, Software Defined Storage and Object Storage.
 
       Within Systems, total first quarter strategic
imperatives revenue of $653 million decreased 6.1 percent as reported and 5
percent adjusted for currency year to year. Within the strategic imperatives,
Cloud revenue of $509 million grew 1.3 percent as reported and 2 percent
adjusted for currency.

       The Systems gross profit margin increased 2.4 points
to 57.2 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. This
increase was due to margin (3.7 points) with improvements across all hardware
brands, partially offset by a less favorable product mix (1.3 points). Gross
profit detail is provided within this segment for additional information due to
the new alignment of software content into this segment beginning this quarter.
        
       Systems
had a pre-tax loss of $10 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared with
pre-tax income of $261 million in the prior year with a decrease in pre-tax
margin of 11.8 points year to year. This decline reflects the improved gross
profit margin on lower revenue and the impact of transformation actions,
including workforce rebalancing, which is about half the year-to-year decline.
In the first quarter of 2016, there were $130 million of charges primarily
related to real estate and workforce rebalancing actions compared to $20
million of workforce rebalancing charges in the prior year period.
 
Global
Financing
See pages 65 through 70 for a discussion of Global
Financing’s segment results.
 
Total Software
 
        Under
the company's new segment structure, total Software no longer exists as a
segment, instead the company's software revenue is included within the
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, Cognitive Solutions, and Systems
segments. Given the current focus on IBM’s software revenue performance, the
company will continue to report total software revenue performance throughout
2016. Total Software revenue, which includes
Cognitive Solutions, Integration Software and Operating Systems Software, of
$5,431 million decreased 2.9 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for
currency in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year period.
Performance reflected improvement at constant currency of 5 points from the
fourth quarter of 2015 driven by a higher mix of annuity revenue versus
transactional content. In addition, the company has been adding new
capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions. This quarter’s
software performance reflects the acquisitions that closed over the last year,
and while these acquisitions contribute to revenue growth, they initially
impact profit performance. The annuity revenue was up 2 percent adjusted for
currency, with steady renewal rates and growth in the SaaS business.
 
       From a product offering perspective, revenue growth
in Solutions Software was offset by continued headwinds in Operating Systems
and Transaction Processing Software. Total software includes a portion of
software support line revenue that was previously reported in Integrated
Technology Services. Support line did not have an impact on the software
revenue growth rate at constant currency.  
  
Geographic Revenue
       In addition to the revenue presentation by
reportable segment, the company also measures revenue performance on a
geographic basis. The following geographic, regional and country-specific
revenue performance excludes OEM revenue.

EMEA first quarter revenue of $5,906 million decreased 3.6 percent as reported

 Within Americas, the U.S. decreased 3.6
percent compared to the prior year and improved sequentially from the prior
quarter. Canada was down 10.7 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for
currency. Latin America decreased 23.8 percent as reported and 8 percent
adjusted for currency, driven by Brazil. Although the company has built a
strong business in Brazil over the years, recent quarters’ performance have
been more volatile. This quarter, Brazil revenue declined, partially due to a
strong prior year first quarter, but also due to an economic environment that
appears uncertain. The company has taken certain portfolio actions in this
business which impacts growth in the short term. On an adjusted basis, the decline
in Brazil was partially offset by growth in other Latin American countries,
including Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia. 
 
  Within EMEA, there was continued
growth in the UK on an adjusted basis, with revenue declining 4.3 percent as
reported, but growing 1 percent adjusted for currency. Germany decreased 2.3
percent as reported and France decreased 2.1 percent as reported, but both
countries were flat year to year adjusted for currency. Italy was flat year to

East and Africa region grew 1.4 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for
currency. However, there was a decline in the Central and Eastern European
region including a year-to-year decline in Russia of 34.2 percent.
 
       Within Asia Pacific, Japan grew 5.3 percent as

       Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expense increased 12.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016 versus the prior
year driven primarily by the following factors:


·        
Higher workforce
rebalancing charges (14 points); and


·        
Acquisition-related spending (2
points); partially offset by


·        
A prior year pension
obligation related to litigation in Spain (4 points); and


·        
The effects of
currency (2 points).


        Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 18.4 percent year
to year driven by primarily the same factors excluding the benefit from the
prior-year pension obligation which was not reflected in operating (non-GAAP)
expense. 


       Bad debt expense increased $14 million year to year. The
receivables provision coverage was 2.8 percent at March 31, 2016, an increase
of 20 basis points from both December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2015.

       Research, development and

of 2016 compared to 6.6 percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. 

       RD&E expense in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3 percent
year to year primarily driven by:


·        
Increased base spending
(9 points); and


·        
Higher expense due to
acquisitions (5 points); partially offset by

       Operating (non-GAAP) RD&E expense increased 12.8

primarily by the same factors.

       Total consolidated
other (income) and expense was expense of $253 million in the first quarter of
2016 compared to income of $143 million in the prior year. The decrease in
income of $396 million year over year was primarily driven by:


·       
Real estate capacity charges
related to the first-quarter 2016 workforce transformation ($328 million); and


·       
Higher foreign currency
transaction losses ($136 million), including a current year devaluation in
Venezuela ($43 million); and


·       
Increased losses from securities
and investment assets ($40 million) primarily related to the sale of Lenovo
shares ($37 million); partially offset by

       The increase in interest expense in the first quarter of 2016
compared with the first quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by higher average
debt levels and higher
average interest rates. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related external borrowings
are to support the Global Financing external business. Overall interest expense
(excluding capitalized interest) for the first quarter of 2016 was $285
million, an increase of $38 million year to year.

        In the first

million compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by a prior year
pension obligation related to litigation ($230 million), a decrease in
recognized actuarial losses ($143 million) and lower defined contribution plans
costs ($17 million); partially offset by lower expected return on plan assets
($80 million).  
 
  As discussed in the “Snapshot” on page
43, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and
others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating
retirement-related costs in the first quarter of 2016 were $356 million, a
decrease of $22 million compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven
by lower defined contribution plans cost ($17 million). Non-operating costs of
$142 million in the first quarter of 2016 decreased $299 million year to year,
driven primarily by a prior year pension obligation related to litigation ($230
million) and a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($143 million); partially
offset by lower expected return on plan assets ($80 million).
 
Taxes
 
       The
continuing operations effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was
(95.1) percent, a decrease of 114.6 points compared to the first quarter of
2015. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was
(66.8) percent, a decrease of 86.8 points compared to the first quarter of
2015. The lower continuing operations effective tax rate in the first quarter
of 2016 was primarily driven by the favorable resolution of a long-standing tax
matter in February 2016 related to the determination of certain foreign tax
losses incurred by the company in Japan (113.3 points), a favorable settlement
of the

remaining open items on the company’s U.S.
income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 (3.6 points), and a benefit related to the
first-quarter 2016 real estate capacity actions (5.2 points). These benefits
were partially offset by a tax charge related to intercompany royalties from
foreign subsidiaries (6.9 points). The decline in the operating (non-GAAP) tax
rate was primarily driven by the same factors.  
 
       In April 2010, the company appealed the
determination of the Japanese Tax Authorities with respect to certain foreign
tax losses. The tax benefit of these losses, approximately $1.0 billion
adjusted for currency, had been included in unrecognized tax benefits as of
December 2015. In April 2011, the company received notification that the appeal
was denied, and in June 2011, the company filed a lawsuit challenging this
decision. In May 2014, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of the company.
The Japanese government appealed the ruling to the Tokyo High Court. On March
25, 2015, the Tokyo High Court ruled in favor of IBM and, on April 7, 2015, the
Japanese government appealed the ruling to the Japan Supreme Court. On February
18, 2016, the Supreme Court denied the government appeal thereby upholding the
Tokyo High Court’s decision in favor of the company as the final judgment in
this matter. This led to a refund of the taxes previously paid of $1.0 billion,
which the company received in the first quarter and included in the effective
tax rate. Interest of $0.2 billion was also received. 
 
       With respect to major U.S. state and
foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax
examinations for years prior to 2011. The company is no longer subject to
income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2013.
The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the
amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected
to result for these years.
 
       The amount of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2015 decreased by $908 million in the first quarter of 2016 to
$3,666 million. The decrease was primarily due to the first quarter favorable resolution
of the Japan tax matter. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $2,796 million at
March 31, 2016. 
 
       In the fourth quarter of 2013, the
company received a draft tax assessment notice for approximately $866 million
(approximately $809 million at first quarter 2016 currency rates) from the
Indian Tax Authorities for 2009. The company believes it will prevail on these
matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability. At
March 31, 2016, the company has recorded $553 million as prepaid income taxes
in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits
paid over time to protect the company’s right to appeal various income tax assessments
made by the Indian Tax Authorities.
 
      
In the first quarter of 2016, the IRS commenced its audit of the company’s U.S.
tax returns for 2013 and 2014. The company anticipates that this audit will be
completed by the end of 2017.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

       Actual shares outstanding at March 31, 2016 were
960.0 million. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
assuming dilution during the first quarter of 2016 was 28.0 million shares
lower than the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of
the common stock repurchase program.
  
Results of
Discontinued Operations
       The loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was $3 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to
$88 million in the first quarter of 2015. The discontinued operations effective
tax rate in the first quarter of 2016 was 38.4 percent compared to 26.3 percent
in the first quarter of 2015.  
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At March 31, 2016, the company continued to have the
financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $14,869 million. Total debt of $45,557 million increased $5,667 million from prior
year-end levels, driven by new debt issuances of $8,062 million, partially
offset by maturities of $2,184 million. Within total debt, $26,782 million, or
approximately 59 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business. The
company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital
preservation and liquidity objectives. In the first
three months of 2016, the company generated $5,645 million in cash from
operations, an increase of $2,035 million compared to the first three  months of 2015. The company has consistently
generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to
additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its $10 billion global credit facility. In October 2015,
the term of the five-year global credit facility was extended by one year, and
now expires on November 10, 2020.  
 
       The assets and debt associated with the Global
Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial position.
The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the
consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in the
separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 65, are supplementary data
presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.

       Total debt of $45,557 million was up $5,667 million
from December 31, 2015, consistent with the increase in the cash balance over
that period, driven by the timing of the company’s current year term debt
issuances. 
 
       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Technology Services & Cloud
Platforms, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global
Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Technology Services
& Cloud Platforms assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global
Financing asset base. The debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global
Financing section on page 69.
 
       Non-Global Financing debt of $18,774 million was up
$6,090 million from December 31, 2015 and up $6,269 million from the first
quarter of 2015. 
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions. “Core”
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
62.2 percent at March 31, 2016 compared to 54.3 percent at December 31, 2015
and 59.4 percent at March 31, 2015. 
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization
ratio at March 31, 2016 was 75.1 percent versus 73.4 percent at December 31,
2015 and 75.9 percent at March 31, 2015.

Equity
 
       Total equity increased by $649 million from December
31, 2015 as a result of an increase in retained earnings of $764 million, an
increase in retirement-related pension amounts of $335 million and an increase
of $505 million related to currency translation, partially offset by an
increase in treasury stock of $886 million primarily due to common stock
repurchases. 
 
Looking Forward 
 
      The company’s strategies, investments and actions are
all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term
perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of
major shifts occurring in technology, business and the global economy.
 
Within the IT industry, there are major
shifts occurring—driven by data and analytics, cloud and changes in the ways
individuals and enterprises are engaging. In January 2016, to support this
ongoing transformation, the company made a number of changes to its management
system and organizational structure.  In
February, the company met with investors to discuss the progress of the
transformation, and detailed how IBM is becoming more than a hardware, software
and services company; it is emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud
platform company.  
 
In the first quarter of 2016, the company had continued
strong performance in its strategic imperatives that are focused on these
market shifts. The company’s strategic imperatives - cloud, analytics, mobile,
social and security solutions revenue grew 14 percent year to year as reported
and 17 percent adjusted for currency. Over the past 12 months, the strategic
imperatives generated $29.8 billion in revenue, which represents approximately
37 percent of the company’s total revenue, an increase of 2 points from
full-year 2015. In the first quarter, the company continued to take significant
actions to drive the shift towards its strategic imperatives with targeted investments,
including acquisitions in Cognitive Solutions and GBS, as well as taking
actions to transform the workforce and accelerate the move away from non-strategic
areas. While these actions impacted profit and margins in the first quarter,
they improve the position for the future.
  
The company’s strategic direction is
clear and compelling, and the company continues its shift to the higher value
areas of enterprise IT. The strong revenue growth in the strategic imperatives
confirms that, as does the overall profitability of the business. The company
expects revenue from its strategic imperatives to continue to deliver strong
growth. These offerings are as high value as other parts of the business, which
continue to manage clients’ most critical business processes. In addition, the
company expects to continue to allocate its capital efficiently and effectively
to investments, and to return value to its shareholders through a combination
of dividends and share repurchases. Over the longer term, in consideration of
the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company expects to have the
ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher value
business mix, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth,
with free cash flow realization in the 90’s percent range.
 
In the near term, there are a few
dynamics that are inconsistent with that longer term trajectory. Specifically,
in 2016, the company will be continuing to manage and drive the ongoing
transformation of the business. As an example, GBS continues its transition,
with strong growth in strategic imperatives offset by declines in the more
traditional areas. The company will continue to engineer this shift. The
company expects a continued impact to its software transaction revenue growth,
as many of its largest customers continue to utilize the flexibility that the
company has provided, as they commit to the company’s platform for the longer
term. In addition, while the company is fully participating in the shift to
cloud, the margins in that business are impacted by the level of investment the
company is making, and the fact that the business is not yet at scale.
 
The company continues to expect a
significant impact to profit from currency in 2016 due to year-to-year impacts
from hedging. The company previously reported a full-year expectation of $1.3
billion of negative profit impact (or $1.00 of earnings per share) from
currency. At mid-April 2016 spot rates, modest improvement over previous
expectations could result. 
 
Overall, looking forward, the company
expects to continue to grow in many areas of the business, including continued
strong growth in the strategic imperatives. Recent acquisitions are beginning
to contribute to revenue and while they impact profit negatively initially, the
acquisitions will provide profit contribution over time. The company will
continue to invest at a high level, shifting to areas that have the best
opportunity. Many of the capabilities being built are cloud-based and delivered
as a service. This profile and level of investment will impact margin in the
short-term, but achieve the company’s long-term strategy and profit model. In
January 2016, the company provided expectations for the year that it would
acquire key capabilities, rebalance its workforce, resolve various matters
including tax matters, and return value to shareholders. This was 

61



Management Discussion –

all taken into account in the full-year view of earnings
per share. With the successful resolution of a significant tax matter and large
workforce rebalancing action, the company made significant progress in the
first quarter. Overall, the company now expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing
operations for 2016 to be at least $12.35. The company continues to expect operating
(non-GAAP) earnings per share to be at least $13.50, which excludes acquisition-related
charges of $0.76 per share and non-operating retirement-related items of $0.39
per share. For the first half of 2016, the company expects operating (non-GAAP)
earnings per share to be between 38 and 39 percent of the full year
expectation.
 
As the company continues to build new
businesses in areas such as Watson Health and Watson IoT, this requires
different skills and in different locations. The first quarter workforce
rebalancing actions are about transforming the workforce. Savings from the $1
billion of workforce actions are expected to be approximately $500 million or
slightly more in 2016 and close to $2 billion on an annualized basis. 
 
From a segment perspective, in the first
quarter, mainframe revenues decreased consistent with product cycle dynamics.
Mainframe margins are expected to improve in 2016 in line with that cycle.
Services backlog declined slightly to $122.4 billion with decreased signings in
the quarter. Both Technology Services & Cloud Platforms and GBS expect to
continue to move clients into hybrid environments. GBS gross margins declined
in the quarter, aligned with the shift to higher value services, which has a
near term impact on margin. Under the new segment structure, software value has
been integrated into three of the segments: Cognitive Solutions, Technology
Services & Cloud Platforms, and Systems. The software annuity base
continued to grow with steady renewal rates and growth in the
Software-as-a-Service business. As expected, transactional mix was not as
impactful in the first quarter of 2016 as it was in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The company expects acquisitions to drive improvement in the software revenue
trajectory in 2016.
 
Free cash flow realization, defined as
free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), was 98 percent as
reported in 2015 and is expected to remain in the 90’s percent level in 2016.
At the profit level associated with the earnings per share expectations, this
translates to a free cash flow range of $11 billion to $12 billion in 2016. The
company now expects free cash flow for 2016 at the high end of that range at
the expected profit level.
 
Looking forward to the second quarter of
2016, the company expects the typical seasonal increase in profit improvement
from the first to second quarter, with further improvement as a result of
significant first quarter charges for workforce rebalancing, real estate
actions, and actions in Latin America. The company will have partially
offsetting impacts as a result of acquisitions, and quarter-to-quarter impact
from currency hedges. As a result, the company expects approximately $2 billion
of improvement in pre-tax profit from first to second quarter 2016.
  
The company expects, in the normal
course of business, that its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate will be 19 percent,
plus or minus a couple of percentage points, for 2016. The GAAP tax rate is
expected to be approximately 1 point lower. The rate will change year to year
based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and
changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of
income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
The company expects 2016 pre-tax
retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of
approximately $600 million compared to 2015. This estimate reflects current
pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2015. Within total
retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is
expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, a decrease of approximately $100
million versus 2015. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to
be approximately $500 million, a decrease of approximately $500 million
compared to 2015, driven by decreased recognized actuarial losses and the
Spanish pension litigation impacts in 2015. Contributions for all
retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2016,
approximately flat compared to 2015.
 
The company uses December 31 as the
year-end measurement date for all its retirement-related plans. If a
significant event, such as curtailment occurs, a remeasurement would be
performed. No curtailment gains or losses were recorded as of March 31, 2016 and
the company continues to evaluate the impact of actions on its worldwide
postretirement defined benefit plans. 
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar (USD) affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At March 31, 2016, currency changes resulted in assets and
liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars
than at year-end 2015. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit
specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. 

62



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this
information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could
take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the
company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first three
months of 2016. Based on the currency rate movements in the first three months
of 2016, total revenue decreased 4.6 percent as reported and decreased 2.0
percent at constant currency versus the first three months of 2015. On an income
from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts
offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical
maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) decrease of approximately $20
million in the first three months of 2016 on both an as-reported basis and an
operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in a
decrease of approximately $175 million in the first three months of 2015 on an
as-reported basis and a decrease of approximately $320 million on an operating
(non-GAAP) basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum
impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational
responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and
timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency
impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be
substantially less than the theoretical maximum
given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
 
      
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
       The company continues to monitor the
economic conditions in Venezuela. In mid-February 2016, changes to the
currency exchange systems were announced which eliminated the SICAD exchange
rate and replaced the SIMADI rate with DICOM, which is expected to be a
floating exchange rate. The company recorded a pre-tax loss of $43 million in
the first quarter of 2016 in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings as a result of the elimination of SICAD and devaluation
in the new exchange. The company's net assets denominated in local currency
were $2 million at March 31, 2016. The company’s operations in Venezuela comprised
less than 1 percent of total 2015 and 2014 revenue, respectively.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2015 Annual Report, on pages 61 to 64,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 61 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
three months ended, or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2016, those amounts are
$5.6 billion for net cash from operating activities, $14.9 billion of cash and
marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. 
 
      The major rating agencies’ ratings
on the company’s debt securities at March 31, 2016 appear in the table below.
The agency ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2015. Standard and
Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings reaffirmed their credit
ratings on April 21, 2015, March 30, 2016 and June 24, 2015, respectively. The
company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or
documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and
seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit
rating. The company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments
contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the
agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At March 31, 2016, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability
position was $461 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is
subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of
the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no
other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating,
would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

      The table appearing on page 62 of the company’s
2015 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash flows
for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of the way
cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. The company prepares its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting
standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and
highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format
on page 59. The following is management’s view of cash flows for the first

cash flow of $2.3 billion for the first three months of 2016 increased $1.2
billion year to year. The increase was driven primarily by a refund of
previously paid taxes in Japan of $1.0 billion and a year-to-year decline in
U.S. income tax payments of $0.9 billion; partially offset by a decline in cash
sourced from sales cycle working capital ($0.4 billion). Net capital
expenditures of $1.0 billion were essentially flat year to year, with continued
investment in cloud capacity. In the first three months of 2016, the company
continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders
including $1.2 billion in dividends and $0.9 billion in gross common stock
repurchases. 
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2015 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe
downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in note 12, “Contingencies,” in this
Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $500 million in 2016. Contributions related to all
retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2016.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum
contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent
remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.  
 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options
available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at
reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility,
repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany loans with
certain foreign subsidiaries.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

        The
company does earn a significant amount of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The
company’s policy is to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries, and accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes
has been made on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company
periodically repatriates a portion of these earnings to the extent that it does
not incur an additional U.S. tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax
liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not
practicable. While the company currently does not have a need to repatriate
funds held by its foreign subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for
operations and obligations in the U.S., the company could elect to repatriate
these funds which could result in a reassessment of the company’s policy and
increased tax expense.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  
Global Financing
 
       Global Financing is a reportable segment that is
measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients’
acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by
providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise,
while generating strong returns on equity.

       The decrease in
revenue in the first quarter, as compared to the same period in 2015, was due
to:
 
·        
A decline in internal revenue of
17.1 percent, due to decreases in used equipment sales revenue (down 18.6
percent to $402 million) and financing revenue (down 9.0 percent to $85
million); and
 
·        
A decline in external revenue of
11.2 percent as reported (6.4 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease
in financing revenue (down 14.0 percent to $318 million).
 
       The decreases in
external and internal financing revenue in the first quarter of 2016, compared
to the same period in 2015, were due to lower asset yields and a decrease in the
average asset balance.
 
       Global Financing gross
profit decreased 11.6 percent in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the
same period in 2015, due to decreases in used equipment sales gross profit and
financing gross profit. The gross profit margin increased 2.3 points in the first
quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, due to an increase in the
financing margin. 
 
       Global Financing
pre-tax income decreased 25.0 percent to $386 million in the first quarter of
2016, compared to the same period in 2015, due to a lower gross profit ($82
million) as well as increases in financing receivables provisions ($24 million)
and in selling, general and administrative expenses ($24 million). The increase
in financing receivables provisions was due to higher unallocated reserve
requirements primarily in Brazil, partially offset by lower specific reserve
requirements in the current year.
 
      The decrease in return
on equity in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the same period of 2015,
was due to the decrease in net income, partially offset by the decrease in
equity.

(3) These assets, along with all other
financing assets in this table, are leveraged at the value in the table using
Global Financing     
     debt.
(4) Global Financing debt is comprised of
intercompany loans and external debt. A portion of Global Financing debt is in
support  
of the company's internal business, or
related to intercompany mark-up embedded in the Global Financing assets. 
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and services, but also OEM
equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients’ total solutions
requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type, direct
financing and operating leases for systems products, as well as loans and
installment payment plans for systems, software and services, with terms up to
seven years. Global Financing’s client loans and installment payment plans are
primarily for software and services and are unsecured. These agreements are
subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed
necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks, which include covenants to
protect against credit deterioration during the life of the obligation. 
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
        In addition to the actions previously described,
the company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in
certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including
credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of
receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or
sales of equipment under operating lease.
 
       At March 31, 2016, substantially all financing
assets were IT related assets, and approximately 51 percent of the total
external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to
consumers. The reduction in investment grade year to year (4 points) was driven
primarily by rating changes within the existing portfolio, not by changing the
company’s approach to the market. This
investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in
the portfolio. 

66



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

Additionally, as noted above, the
company takes actions to transfer exposure to third parties. On that basis, the
investment grade content would increase by 14 points to 65 percent.

      Cash collections of both commercial

the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 which resulted in a net decline in financing
assets in these periods. The increase in originations in 2016 versus 2015 was
due to an increase in commercial financing volumes. Internal loan financing with Technology Services
& Cloud Platforms is executed under a loan facility and is not considered
originations.
 
        Cash generated by Global Financing was deployed to pay
intercompany payables and dividends to IBM as well as business partners and OEM
suppliers.

       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 2.1 percent at December 31, 2015, to 2.6 percent at
March 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in unallocated reserve
requirements. Unallocated reserves increased 66 percent from $93 million at
December 31, 2015, to $155 million at March 31, 2016, primarily due to Brazil.
Specific reserves increased 2 percent from $517 million at December 31, 2015,
to $527 million at March 31, 2016. 
 
       Global Financing’s bad debt expense was $76 million for
the first three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to $52 million for the
same period in 2015. The year-to-year increase in bad debt expense was due to
higher unallocated reserve requirements in Brazil driven by deteriorating
economic conditions, partially offset by lower specific reserve requirements in
China. 
  




67



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

Residual Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a
lease, surplus internal equipment, or used equipment purchased externally.
These sales represented 55.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, and 55.9
percent in the first quarter of 2015. The gross profit margins on these sales
were 63.8 percent and 63.6 percent in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 
 
       The
table below presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2016 and March
31, 2016. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of
the related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31, 2016 is expected to
be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on
a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of
the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While primarily focused on IBM
products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM products. These
third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided for
by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for the
covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease
payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a
sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate
asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $91
million and $101 million for the financing transactions originated during
the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate asset
values associated with the guarantees of direct financing leases were $39
million and $50 million for the financing transactions originated during the
quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The associated aggregate
guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $3 million and
$8 million for the financing transactions originated in the quarters ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.3 million
and $0.8 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the

intercompany loans are set by the company to
substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing receivable
and are based on arm's-length pricing.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly,
interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client
and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of
Operations” on page 65 and in “Segment Information” on page 27.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related
interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to the
company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of long-term services
contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these assets should
be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business
model.

       Global
Financing is a segment of the company, and therefore is supported by the
company’s overall liquidity position and access to capital markets. Cash
generated by Global Financing was deployed to pay dividends to the company in
order to maintain an appropriate debt-to-equity ratio.

Looking
Forward
 
       Global Financing's financial position provides
flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to be well
positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s assets and new
financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed to the
company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets
are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term commercial
paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A protracted period
where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown
in originations.  

69



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As previously discussed, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global Financing has policies in
place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies,
combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent
management of the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty
with respect to the global economy.

GAAP
Reconciliation
 
       The tables below provide a reconciliation of the
company’s income statement results as reported under GAAP to its operating
earnings presentation which is a non-GAAP measure. The company’s calculation of
operating (non-GAAP) earnings, as presented, may differ from similarly titled
measures reported by other companies. Refer to the “Snapshot” section on page
43 for the company’s rationale for presenting operating earnings information.
