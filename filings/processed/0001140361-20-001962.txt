NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)






1


BASIS OF PRESENTATION






The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring items) necessary to present
        fairly the financial position of Johnson Outdoors Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, and their results of operations for the three month periods then ended and cash flows for the three
        month periods then ended. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
        September 27, 2019 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2019.


Due to seasonal variations and other factors, the results of operations for the three months ended December 27, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the Company’s full 2020 fiscal
        year.  See “Seasonality” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere herein for additional information.


The Company considers all short-term investments in interest-bearing accounts and all securities and other instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, to be equivalent to cash.  Cash equivalents are
        stated at cost which approximates market value.  Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year.


All monetary amounts, other than share and per share amounts, are stated in thousands.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE






Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $3,062, $2,550 and $1,327 as of December 27, 2019, September 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively. The increase in net accounts
        receivable to $78,249 as of December 27, 2019 from $44,508 as of September 27, 2019 is attributable to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business and the resulting increases in sales volumes between periods. The determination of the allowance
        for doubtful accounts is based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where specific collection concerns about a receivable exist, a reserve is established to value the affected account receivable at an amount the Company believes will be
        collected. For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding for each business segment. Uncollectible accounts are written
        off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company typically does not require collateral on its accounts receivable.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”)






Net income or loss per share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is computed using the two-class method.  Grants of restricted stock which receive non-forfeitable dividends are classified as participating
        securities and are required to be included as part of the basic weighted average share calculation under the two-class method.


Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cash dividends equal to 110% of all dividends declared and paid on each share of Class B common stock. The Company grants shares of unvested restricted stock in the form
        of Class A shares, which carry the same distribution rights as the Class A common stock described above.  As such, the undistributed earnings for each period are allocated to each class of common stock based on the proportionate share of the amount
        of cash dividends that each such class is entitled to receive.


Basic EPS


Basic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss allocated to Class A common stock and Class B common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B
        common stock outstanding, respectively.  In periods with cumulative year to date net income and undistributed income, the undistributed income for each period is allocated to each class of common stock based on the proportionate share of the amount
        of cash dividends that each such class is entitled to receive.  In periods where there is a cumulative year to date net loss or no undistributed income because distributions through dividends exceed net income, Class B shares are treated as
        anti-dilutive and, therefore, net losses are allocated equally on a per share basis among all participating securities.

Index


JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

 





For the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, basic income per share for the Class A and Class B shares has been presented using the two class method and reflects the allocation of
        undistributed income described above.


Diluted EPS


Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing allocated net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options, restricted stock units (“stock
        units” or “units”) and non-vested restricted stock.  Anti-dilutive stock options, units and non-vested stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.  The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes that
        Class B common stock is converted into Class A common stock.  Therefore, diluted net income per share is the same for both Class A and Class B common shares.  In periods where the Company reports a net loss, the effect of anti-dilutive stock
        options and units is excluded and diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share for both classes of stock.


For the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, diluted net income per share reflects the effect of dilutive stock units and assumes the conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common
        stock.


Non-vested stock that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future which were not included in the fully diluted computation because they would have been anti-dilutive totaled 40,312 and 38,562 for the
        three months ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.  There were no stock options outstanding and no stock units that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future for either of the three month periods ended
        December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018.


Dividends per share


Dividends per share for the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 were as follows:

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS






The Company’s current stock ownership plans allow for issuance of stock options to acquire shares of Class A common stock by key executives and non-employee directors. Current plans also allow for issuance of shares of
        restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights in lieu of stock options.


Under the Company’s 2012 Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Plan (the only plan where shares currently remain available for future equity incentive awards) there were a total of 492,411 shares of the Company’s Class
        A common stock available for future grant to key executives and non-employee directors at December 27, 2019.  As of December 13, 2019, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock are no longer eligible for issuance as future equity incentive
        awards to key employees under the Company’s 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan.  Any outstanding awards under the Company’s 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan as of the December 13, 2019 termination date will continue to remain outstanding and be
        subject to the terms of such plan and any award agreement entered into by the Company with the participant.  The Company has adopted the Johnson Outdoors Inc. 2020 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, subject to approval of this plan by the shareholders
        of the Company at the annual meeting of shareholders on February 27, 2020.  The 2020 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan authorizes up to 500,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for issuance as awards to key employees under this new plan.

Non-vested Stock


All shares of non-vested restricted stock awarded by the Company have been granted in the form of shares of Class A common stock at their fair market value on the date of grant and vest within one year from the date of
        grant for stock granted to directors and four years from the date of grant for stock granted to officers and employees.  The fair value at date of grant is based on the number of shares granted and the average of the Company’s high and low Class A
        common stock price on the date of grant or, if the Company’s Class A shares did not trade on the date of grant, the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common stock price on the last preceding date on which the Company’s Class A shares
        traded.


A summary of non-vested stock activity for the three months ended December 27, 2019 related to the Company’s stock ownership plans is as follows:
 



 
Non-vested stock grantees may elect to reimburse the Company for withholding taxes due as a result of the vesting of shares by tendering a portion of the vested shares back to the Company.  Shares tendered back to the
        Company were 4,054 and 3,381 during the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.


Stock compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to non-vested stock was $240 and $116 for the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.  Unrecognized compensation cost
        related to non-vested stock as of December 27, 2019 was $1,367, which amount will be amortized to expense through November 2022 or adjusted for changes in future estimated or actual forfeitures.


The fair value of restricted stock vested during the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 was $839 and $1,237, respectively.


Restricted Stock Units


All restricted stock units (RSUs) awarded by the Company have been granted in the form of units payable in shares of Class A common stock upon vesting.  The units are valued at the fair market value of a share of Class
        A common stock on the date of grant and vest within one year from the date of grant for RSUs granted to directors and three years from the date of grant for RSUs granted to employees.  The fair value at the date of grant is based on the number of
        units granted and the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common stock trading price on the date of grant or, if the Company’s Class A shares did not trade on the date of grant, the average of the Company’s high and low Class A common
        stock trading price on the last preceding date on which the Company’s Class A shares traded.


A summary of RSU activity for the three months ended December 27, 2019 follows:
 



 
Stock compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to RSUs was $420 and $402 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.  Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
        RSUs as of December 27, 2019 was $2,986, which amount will be amortized to expense through September 2021 or adjusted for changes in future estimated or actual forfeitures.

RSU grantees may elect to reimburse the Company for withholding taxes due as a result of the vesting of units and issuance of unrestricted shares of Class A common stock by tendering a portion of such unrestricted
        shares back to the Company.  Shares tendered back to the Company were 3,075 and 6,509 during the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.


The fair value of restricted stock units recognized as a tax deduction during the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 was $1,426 and $2,944, respectively.


Compensation expense related to units earned by employees (as opposed to grants to outside directors) is based upon the attainment of certain Company financial goals related to cumulative net sales and cumulative
        operating profit over a three-year performance period.  Awards are only paid if at least 80% of the target levels are met and maximum payouts are made if 120% or more of target levels are achieved.  The payouts for achievement at the threshold
        levels of performance are equal to 50% of the target award amount.  The payouts for achievement at maximum levels of performance are equal to 150% of the target award amount.  To the extent earned, awards are issued in shares of Company Class A
        common stock after the end of the three-year performance period.


Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan


The Company’s shareholders have adopted the Johnson Outdoors Inc. 2009 Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, which was most recently amended on March 2, 2017, and which provides for the issuance of shares of Class A common
        stock at a purchase price of not less than 85% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant or on the date of purchase, whichever is lower.


During the three month period ended December 27, 2019, the Company issued 0 shares of Class A common stock and recognized $7 of expense in connection with the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan.  During the three month
        period ended December 28, 2018, the Company issued 0 shares of Class A common stock and recognized $18 of expense in connection with the Plan.

PENSION PLANS






The Company has non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its U.S. employees. Retirement benefits are generally provided based on the employees’ years of service and average earnings. Normal
        retirement age is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement.


The Company made contributions of $44 and $45 to its pension plans for the three months ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.


The components of net periodic benefit cost related to Company sponsored defined benefit plans for the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 were as follows:

INCOME TAXES






For the three months ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, the Company’s earnings before income taxes, income tax expense and effective income tax rate were as follows:



 
The key factor impacting the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 27, 2019 was the net excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which were lower in the current period compared to the
        prior year period.


The impact of the Company’s operations in jurisdictions where a valuation allowance is assessed is removed from the overall effective tax rate methodology and recorded directly based on year to date results for the
        year for which no tax expense or benefit can be recognized.  The significant tax jurisdictions that have a valuation allowance for the periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 were:
 




December 27, 2019


December 28, 2018

Switzerland

The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes.  As a result, the Company may adjust
        the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits due to the impact of changes in its assumptions or as a result of new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with
        taxing authorities and lapses of statutes of limitation.  The Company’s 2020 fiscal year tax expense is anticipated to be unchanged related to uncertain income tax positions.


In accordance with its accounting policy, the Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized benefits as a component of income tax expense.  The Company is projecting accrued interest of $100
        related to uncertain income tax positions for the fiscal year ending October 2, 2020.


The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal, state, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions.   As of the date of this report, the following tax years remain open to
        examination by the respective significant tax jurisdictions:

GOODWILL






The changes in goodwill during the three months ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 were as follows:







The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for a reporting unit on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances warrant such an evaluation.  In conducting this analysis, the Company uses
        the income approach to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value to its indicated fair value.  Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions
        and is considered a Level 3 (unobservable) fair value determination in the fair value hierarchy (see Note 13) below.

WARRANTIES






The Company provides warranties on certain of its products as they are sold. The following table summarizes the Company’s warranty activity for the three months ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018.
 



 




10


CONTINGENCIES






The Company is subject to various legal actions and proceedings in the normal course of business, including those related to commercial disputes, product liability, intellectual property and regulatory matters. The
        Company is insured against loss for certain of these matters. Although litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate exposure with respect to these matters cannot be ascertained, management does not believe the final outcome of any
        pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company.






11


INDEBTEDNESS






The Company had no debt outstanding at December 27, 2019, September 27, 2019, or December 28, 2018.


Revolvers
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into an unsecured credit facility with PNC Bank National Association and Associated Bank, N.A. (“the Lending Group”).  This credit facility consists of a $75
        million Revolving Credit Facility among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, PNC Bank National Association, as lender and as administrative agent, and the other lender named therein (the “Credit Agreement” or “Revolver”).  The
        Revolver has an expiration date of November 15, 2022 and provides for borrowing of up to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75,000 with a $50,000 accordion feature that gives the Company the option to increase the maximum financing
        availability (i.e., an aggregate borrowing amount of $125,000) subject to the conditions of the Credit Agreement and subject to the approval of the lenders.



- 11 -






Index


JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

 





The interest rate on the Revolver is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which margin resets each quarter.  The applicable margin ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% and is dependent on the Company’s leverage ratio for
        the trailing twelve month period.  The interest rates on the Revolver at December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 were approximately 2.8% and 3.5%, respectively.


The Credit Agreement restricts the Company’s ability to incur additional debt, includes maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio covenants and is unsecured.


Other Borrowings
The Company had no unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of December 27, 2019 or December 28, 2018.  The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future
        claims under its workers’ compensation insurance, which totaled approximately $181 and $279 as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, respectively.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES






The following disclosures describe the Company’s objectives in using derivative instruments, the business purpose or context for using derivative instruments, and how the Company believes the use of derivative
        instruments helps achieve the stated objectives.  In addition, the following disclosures describe the effects of the Company’s use of derivative instruments and hedging activities on its financial statements.


Foreign Exchange Risk
The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the
        foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated
        financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly.  Approximately 12% of the Company’s revenues for the three month period ended December 27, 2019 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 6% were denominated in
        euros, approximately 3% were denominated in Canadian dollars and approximately 1% were denominated in Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining revenues denominated in various other foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can
        cause the Company to experience unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.


The Company may mitigate a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Foreign currency forward contracts enable the Company to lock in the foreign
        currency exchange rate to be paid or received for a fixed amount of currency at a specified date in the future. The Company may use such foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange
        rates on financial instruments and known commitments, including commitments for inventory purchases, denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, the Company held no foreign currency forward contracts.






13


FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS






Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
        transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy has been established
        based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable.






•


Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets or liabilities.







- 12 -






Index


JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

 









•


Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable
                  instruments.










•


Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
                  liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances.






The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated their fair values at December 27, 2019, September 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 due to the
        short term maturities of these instruments. When indicators of impairment are present, the Company may be required to value certain long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment, and other intangibles at their fair value.


Valuation Techniques


Rabbi Trust Assets
Rabbi trust assets are classified as trading securities and are comprised of marketable debt and equity securities that are marked to fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.  The rabbi trust
        assets are used to fund amounts the Company owes to certain officers and other employees under the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan.  These assets are included in “Other assets” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance
        Sheets, and the mark to market adjustments on the assets are recorded in “Other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The offsetting deferred compensation liability is also reported at fair
        value as “Deferred compensation liability” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the liability are recorded in “Administrative management, finance and information systems” expense in the accompanying Condensed
        Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). In July 2018, the FASB also issued
        ASU 2018-10 Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases and ASU 2018-11 Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements.  In February 2019, the FASB also issued ASU
        2019-01 Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements.  This ASU and the updates to this ASU require organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key
        information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, and may be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the
        beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available.  The Company adopted the provisions of these ASU’s using the modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the
        first quarter of fiscal 2020, coinciding with the standard’s effective date. The additional disclosures required by the ASU and its updates are included in Note 18 “Leases” of these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
          (Topic 220), which allows for a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. ASU No. 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years
        beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update.  The Company early adopted the ASU in the second quarter of fiscal 2019,
        and elected not to make this optional reclassification.
 
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (Topic 715), which modifies the disclosure requirements for
        employers that sponsor defined pension or postretirement plans. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
        of this guidance on its disclosures.

REVENUES






Adoption of Topic 606


In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and all subsequent ASUs that modified accounting standards Topic 606 using the modified retrospective adoption method.  Upon adoption, the Company
        recorded a right to returns asset of $763 and a corresponding increase in the accrued return liability, resulting in an accrued returns liability of $2,725.  Other than as discussed above, the adoption of this
          new revenue standard did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the timing and amount of its revenue recognition remained substantially unchanged under this new guidance.


Revenue recognition


Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control of our goods at a point in time based on shipping terms and
        transfer of title.  Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods.  The amount of consideration received can vary, primarily because of customer incentive or rebate arrangements.  The
        Company estimates variable consideration based on the expected value of total consideration to which customers are likely to be entitled based on historical experience and projected market expectations.   Included in the estimate is an assessment
        as to whether any variable consideration is constrained.  Revenue estimates are adjusted at the earlier of a change in the expected value of consideration or when the consideration becomes fixed.  For all contracts with customers, the Company has
        not adjusted the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer’s payment is expected to be one year or less.  Sales are made on normal
        and customary short-term credit terms, generally ranging from 30 to 90 days, or upon delivery of point of sale transactions.  Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.

JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

 





The Company enters into contractual arrangements with customers in the form of individual customer orders which specify the goods, quantity, pricing, and associated order terms. The Company does not have contracts
        which are satisfied over time. Due to the nature of these contracts, no significant judgment exists in relation to the identification of the customer contract, satisfaction of the performance obligation, or transaction price. The Company expenses
        incremental costs of obtaining a contract due to the short-term nature of the contracts.


Estimated costs of returns, allowances and discounts, based on historic experience, are accrued as a reduction to sales when revenue is recognized.  The Company provides customers the right to return eligible products
        under certain circumstances.  At December 27, 2019, the right to returns asset was $1,112 and the accrued returns liability was $3,394.  The Company also offers
        assurance-type warranties relating to its products sold to end customers that continue to be accounted for under ASC 460 Guarantees.


The Company generally accounts for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment activity, consistent with the timing of revenue recognition; that is, when a customer takes control of the transferred goods. In the
        event that a customer were to take control of a product upon or after shipment, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat such shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost.  Shipping and handling fees billed to customers
        are included in “Net Sales,” and shipping and handling costs are recognized within “Marketing and selling expenses” in the same period the related revenue is recognized.


The Company has a wide variety of seasonal, outdoor recreation products used primarily for fishing from a boat, diving, paddling, hiking and camping, that are sold to a variety of customers in multiple end markets.
        While there are multiple products sold, the nature of products are similar in terms of the nature of the revenue recognition policies.


See Note 16 for required disclosures of disaggregated revenue.

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS






The Company conducts its worldwide operations through separate business segments, each of which represents major product lines. Operations are conducted in the United States and various foreign countries, primarily in
        Europe, Canada and the Pacific Basin.  During the three month period ended December 27, 2019, combined net sales to two customers of the Company’s Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation segments represented approximately $32,321 of the
        Company’s consolidated revenues.  During the three month period ended December 28, 2018, combined net sales to two customers of the Company’s Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation segments represented approximately $31,876 of the Company’s
        consolidated revenues.


Net sales and operating profit include both sales to customers, as reported in the Company’s accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and interunit transfers, which are priced to recover cost plus
        an appropriate profit margin. Total assets represent assets that are used in the Company’s operations in each business segment at the end of the periods presented.

LEASES






Adoption of Topic 842


On September 28, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02 and all subsequent ASUs that modified accounting standards Topic 842 using a modified retrospective adoption method, in which right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and
          lease liabilities are recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Under the effective date transition method, financial results reported in periods prior to fiscal year 2020 are unchanged.  The Company also elected the package of
          practical expedients permitted under the standard, which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to contracts containing a lease, lease classification and initial direct lease costs.  As an ongoing accounting policy election,
          the Company will exclude short-term leases (terms of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation and will account for non-lease and lease components in a contract as a single lease component for most asset classes.  All leases in which
          the Company is the lessee are classified as operating leases, and the Company does not have any finance leases or sublease agreements.  Additionally, the Company does not have any leases in which it is the lessor.

 

The adoption of the new standard had a significant impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of approximately $41 million of lease liabilities with corresponding ROU assets for
        operating leases.  The new standard did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated statements of operations or cash flows, and did not impact our debt covenant compliance under our current credit agreements.


The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  The Company leases certain facilities and machinery and equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases.   As of December 27, 2019, the
        Company had approximately 200 leases, with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to 15 years.  Some of the leases contain variable payment terms, such as payments based on fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Some leases also
        contain options to extend or terminate the lease.  To the extent the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options, they have been considered in the calculation of the ROU assets and lease liabilities.  Under current lease agreements,
        there are no residual value guarantees or restrictive lease covenants.  In calculating the ROU assets and lease liabilities, several assumptions and judgments are made, including whether a contract is or contains a lease under the new definition,
        and the determination of the discount rate, which is assumed to be the incremental borrowing rate.  The incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date based on lease length and location.


As of December 27, 2019, the components of lease expense recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations were as follows:





Included in the amounts in the table above, was rent expense to related parties of $246 for the quarter ended December 27, 2019.


As of December 27, 2019, the Company did not have any finance leases.  There were no significant new leases entered into during the quarter ended December 27, 2019.  Supplemental balance sheet, cash flow, and other
        information related to operating leases was as follows:

Overview


The Company is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded seasonal outdoor recreation products used primarily for fishing, diving, paddling and camping.  The Company’s portfolio of well-known consumer brands has attained leading
        market positions due to continuous innovation, marketing excellence, product performance and quality.  The Company’s values and culture support innovation in all areas, promoting and leveraging best practices and synergies within and across its
        subsidiaries to advance the Company’s strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.  The Company is controlled by Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, members
        of her family and related entities.


Highlights


Net sales of $128,054 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $23,614, or 23%, from the same period in the prior year, reflecting increased sales volumes across all businesses.  This sales volume increase, partially offset by additional
        deferred compensation costs related to marking the deferred compensation plan’s assets to market, was the primary driver of an increase of $823 in operating profit over the prior year quarter.


Seasonality


The Company’s business is seasonal in nature. The first fiscal quarter falls prior to the Company’s primary selling season for its warm-weather outdoor recreation products.  The table below sets forth a historical view of the Company’s
        seasonality during the last three fiscal years.

Results of Operations


The Company’s net sales and operating profit (loss) by business segment for the periods shown below were as follows:



 
See “Note 16 – Segments of Business” of the notes to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition of segment net sales and operating profit.


Net Sales


Consolidated net sales for the three months ended December 27, 2019 were $128,054, an increase of $23,614, or 23%, compared to $104,440 for the three months ended December 28, 2018.  Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of less
        than 1% on current year first quarter net sales compared to the prior year’s first quarter net sales.


Net sales for the three months ended December 27, 2019 for the Fishing business were $99,278, an increase of $20,481, or 26%, from $78,797 during the first fiscal quarter of the prior year.  Availability of new products in the current year drove
        much of the growth over the prior year quarter.


Net sales for the Camping business were $7,514 for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, an increase of $1,694, or 29%, from the prior year net sales during the same period of $5,820.  Increased sales volume across both Jetboil and
        Eureka was the primary driver of growth.


Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 for the Watercraft Recreation business were $4,809, an increase of $484, or 11%, compared to $4,325 in the prior year same period.  The increase was mainly driven by success of new products.


Diving net sales were $16,459 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 versus $15,538 for the three months ended December 28, 2018, an increase of $921, or 6%.  The increase is largely due to growth in Europe, partially offset by foreign
        currency translation unfavorably impacting sales in this segment by approximately 2% versus the prior year quarter.


Cost of Sales


Cost of sales for the three months ended December 27, 2019 was $74,442 compared to $60,121 for the three months ended December 28, 2018.  The increase year over year was driven primarily by higher sales volume in the current year quarter over
        the prior year quarter.  Additionally, tariffs on the import of certain components and other supplies from China increased the cost of sales in the current year quarter by approximately $800 over the prior year three month period.


The Company anticipates an aggregate negative impact of Section 301 tariffs on China sourced goods on the Company’s fiscal 2020 operating profit of approximately $4 to $5 million.

Gross Profit Margin


For the three months ended December 27, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 41.9% compared to 42.4% in the three month period ended December 28, 2018.  The slight decline in margin was due primarily to the impact of the
        additional tariffs noted above which were not in effect during our fiscal first quarter of 2019.


Operating Expenses


Operating expenses were $46,811 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 compared to $38,341 for the three months ended December 28, 2018.  The increase of $8,470 was partially due to higher sales volume related expenses between quarters. 
        Additionally, the impact of favorable market conditions on the Company’s deferred compensation plan assets resulted in approximately $3,400 of higher deferred compensation expense in the current year quarter and an offsetting gain in Other Income
        related to marking the assets to market.


Operating Profit


Operating profit on a consolidated basis for the three month period ended December 27, 2019 was $6,801 compared to an operating profit of $5,978 in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.   The increase year over year was driven primarily by
        the increased sales volume and the other factors noted above.


Interest


For the three months ended December 27, 2019, interest expense was $35 compared to $37 in the three months ended December 28, 2018. Interest income for the three month periods ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 was $655 and $540,
        respectively. The increase in interest income year over year was mainly driven by the increase in interest earnings on increased balances of interest bearing cash in fiscal 2020 versus the corresponding periods of fiscal 2019.


Other (Income) Expense, net


Other income was $1,168 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 compared to other expense of $2,150 in the prior year period.  For the three months ended December 27, 2019, foreign currency exchange losses were $33 compared to gains of $165
        for the three months ended December 28, 2018.  Investment gains and earnings on the assets related to the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan were $1,324 in the three month period ended December 27, 2019 compared to investment losses
        of $2,122 in the three month period ended December 28, 2018.  This $3,446 increase year over year in investment gains is offset by the deferred compensation expense included in the Company’s Operating expenses.


Income Tax Expense


The Company’s provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  The effective tax rate for the three month period ended December 27, 2019 was 25.1% compared to
        18.7% in the corresponding period of the prior year.  The key factor impacting the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 27, 2019 was the net excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which were lower in the current
        period compared to the prior year period.


Net Income


Net income for the three months ended December 27, 2019 was $6,430, or $0.64 per diluted common class A and B share, compared to net income of $3,521, or $0.35 per diluted common class A and B share, for the first quarter of the prior fiscal
        year.


Liquidity and Financial Condition


Cash and cash equivalents totaled $138,257 as of December 27, 2019, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $104,214 as of December 28, 2018.  The Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio was 0% as of December 27, 2019 and December 28,
        2018.  The Company’s total debt balance was $0 as of each of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018.  See “Note 11 – Indebtedness” in the notes to the Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.


Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $78,249 as of December 27, 2019, an increase of $22,691 compared to $55,558 as of December 28, 2018.  The increase year over year was consistent with increased sales volumes
        between the same periods.  Inventories, net of inventory reserves, were $103,885 as of December 27, 2019, a decrease of $12,393, compared to $116,278 as of December 28, 2018.  The decrease over the prior year period is due, in part, to pulling
        forward certain purchases in anticipation of the implementation of further Section 301 tariffs on China sourced goods in the prior year.  Accounts payable were $35,384 at December 27, 2019 compared to $41,820 as of December 28, 2018, which
        decreased consistent with the decrease in inventories.

JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

 





The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as presented in the Company’s accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:



 
Operating Activities


Cash used for operations totaled $29,088 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 compared to $39,195 during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The decrease in cash used for operations over the prior year three month period
        was due primarily to the increase in net income between periods, as well as changes between periods in working capital.  Depreciation and amortization charges were $3,432 for the three month period ended December 27, 2019 compared to $3,349 for the
        corresponding period of the prior year.


Investing Activities


Cash used for investing activities totaled $3,307 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 compared to $7,505 for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  Cash used in the prior year period reflected increased investment in
        short-term investments versus cash in that period.  Cash usage for capital expenditures totaled $3,307 for the current year three month period and $4,081 for the prior year period.  Any additional capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 are expected to
        be funded by working capital.


Financing Activities


Cash used for financing activities totaled $2,149 for the three months ended December 27, 2019 compared to $2,092 for the three month period ended December 28, 2018 and represents the payment of dividends and purchase of treasury stock.  The
        Company had no debt during either quarter ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018.  See Note 11 “Indebtedness” to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities.


As of December 27, 2019 the Company held approximately $39,317 of cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts in foreign taxing jurisdictions.


Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements


The Company has contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments including under operating leases and open purchase orders.  The following schedule details these significant contractual obligations existing at December 27, 2019.

JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC.

 





The Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers compensation insurance.  Letters of credit outstanding were approximately $181 and $279 as of December 27, 2019 and December 28,
        2018, respectively.


The Company anticipates making contributions of $128 to its defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of fiscal 2020.


The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates


The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are identified in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019 in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
          Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates.”  There were no significant changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended December 27,
        2019.


 



Item 3.


Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk






The Company’s exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuations in raw material commodity prices, interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under our secured credit facilities and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign
        operations.  The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes.


Foreign Exchange Risk


The Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars, and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the
        Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, increase or
        decrease, accordingly. Approximately 12% of the Company’s revenues for the three month period ended December 27, 2019 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 6% were denominated in euros, approximately 3% in
        Canadian dollars and approximately 1% in Hong Kong dollars, with the remaining revenues denominated in various other foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.  The
        Company may mitigate a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Foreign currency forward contracts enable the Company to lock in the foreign currency exchange rate to be paid
        or received for a fixed amount of currency at a specified date in the future. The Company may use such foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on financial instruments and
        known commitments, including commitments for inventory purchases, denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018, the Company held no foreign currency forward contracts.


Interest Rate Risk


The Company operates in a seasonal business and experiences significant fluctuations in operating cash flow as working capital needs increase in advance of the Company’s primary selling and cash generation season, and decline as accounts
        receivable are collected and cash is accumulated or debt is repaid.  The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its seasonal working capital needs if such needs are funded with short term floating rate debt.


Commodities


Certain components used in the Company’s products are exposed to commodity price changes.  The Company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non-cancelable supply contracts.  Primary commodity price exposures include
        costs associated with metals, resins and packaging materials.


Impact of Inflation


The Company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and, accordingly, the prices of its products.  The Company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through
        changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies.  Price increases and, in certain situations, price decreases are implemented for individual products, when appropriate.

Item 4.


Controls and Procedures






The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be
        disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that the information
        required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
        decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
        and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the
        end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at reaching a level of reasonable assurance. It should be noted that in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that
        any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit
        relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company has designed its disclosure controls and procedures to reach a level of reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.


There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a‑15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
        likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
