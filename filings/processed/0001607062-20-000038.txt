FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
 
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.
 
In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects,"
"plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential,"
"proposed," "intended," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our expectations about our future operating
results or our future financial condition or state other "forward-looking" information. There may be events in the future
that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence
of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial
condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could
lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, and levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under
no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to
actual results.

NOTE
1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The
Company
 
Veritec,
Inc. (Veritec) formed in the State of Nevada on September 8, 1982. Veritec’s wholly-owned subsidiaries include Veritec Financial
Systems, Inc., Tangible Payment Systems, Inc., and Public Bell, Inc. (collectively the “Company”).
 
Nature
of Business
 
Veritec
is primarily engaged in the mobile banking and payment processing business.
 
As
a Cardholder Independent Sales Organization, Veritec can promote and sell Visa-branded card programs. As a Third-Party Servicer,
Veritec provides back-end cardholder transaction processing services for Visa-branded card programs on behalf of its sponsoring
bank. Veritec has a portfolio of five United States and eight foreign patents. Also, Veritec has seven U.S. and twenty-eight
foreign pending patent applications. Veritec had agreements with various banks in the past and is currently seeking a bank to
sponsor its Prepaid Card programs.
 

On May 14, 2019, The US Patent Office issued
Veritec, Inc. Patent No. US 10,289,942 B2 titled Combined Event Driver and Financial Card. On July 23, 2019, the US Patent Office
issued Veritec, Inc. Patent No. US 10,360,556 B2 titled Financial Card Transaction Security and Processing Methods. The Company
is seeking to sell a fractional interest in the patents to investors, and to license the use of the patents. 
 
BASIS
OF PRESENTATION 
 
The
accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States of America
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q. Accordingly, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required
for complete financial statements.
 
In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the period ended December 31, 2019, are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2020. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet information as of June 30, 2019, was
derived from the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019, included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on
September 30, 2019. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.
 
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Veritec and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Veritec
Financial Systems, Inc., Tangible Payment Systems, Inc., and Public Bell, Inc. Inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated
in consolidation.
 
GOING
CONCERN 
 
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period
ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred a loss from operations of $184,081 and used cash in operating activities of $205,547,
and on December 31, 2019, the Company had a stockholders’ deficit of $5,473,388. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the
Company is delinquent in payment of $642,511 of its notes payable. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition,
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2019 financial statements, has
raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
 

 9 
 

 

The
Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through fiscal 2020 and to continue to develop its
existing projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to purchase the Company’s securities, generating
sufficient sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination thereof. There is no assurance that the Company
can be successful in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales, or reducing major costs. Further, if the Company is successful
in raising such funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales may cause significant dilution to existing holders
of common stock. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from this uncertainty.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Those
estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts, analysis of impairments of long-lived assets,
accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions used in valuing stock-based compensation, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
 
Revenue
Recognition
 
Revenues
for the Company are classified into mobile banking technology revenue and management fee revenue.


 

 
The
Company recognized revenue in accordance Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”) which
superseded previous revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities
to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with
a customer, (2) identifying the Company’s performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.
 
Mobile
Banking Technology Revenue
 
The
Company, as a merchant payment processor and a distributor, recognizes revenue from transaction fees charged to cardholders for
the use of its issued mobile debit cards. The fees are recognized monthly after all cardholder transactions have been summarized
and reconciled with third party processors.
 
The
Company has entered into certain long-term agreements to provide application development and support. Some customers paid the
agreement in full at signing, and the Company recorded the receipt of payment as deferred revenue. The Company records revenue
relating to these agreements on a pro-rata basis over the term of the agreement and reduces its deferred revenue balance accordingly.
 
Other
Revenue, Management Fee - Related Party
 
On
December 31, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology, which was comprised solely of its intellectual
property, to The Matthews Group, a related party (see Note 6). The Company subsequently entered into a management services agreement
with The Matthews Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations through June 30, 2020. The Company earns a fee
of 35% of all revenues billed up to June 30, 2020, and recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 
The
Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities based on the exchange price in U.S. dollars that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy with
three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:
 


 
•
Level 1 —
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 
•
Level 2 —
    Inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
    market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

 
•
Level 3 —
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
    or liabilities.

 
The
carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate
the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
 
Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share
 
Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued, using the treasury
stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation as their effect is antidilutive. 
 
For
the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential
dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive effect.
 
As
of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we excluded the outstanding securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire
shares of common stock, from our calculation of earnings per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
 

 
Concentrations
 
During
the three and six month period ended December 31, 2019, the Company had one customer, a related party, that represented 62% and
75% of our revenues, respectively. During the three and six month period ended December 31, 2018, the Company had one customer,
a related party that represented 60% and 74% of its revenues, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of our
revenues during the period ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
During
the period ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, all of the Company’s revenues were earned in the United States of America.
 
Segments
 
The
Company operates in one segment, the mobile financial banking industry. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting”
Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President,
who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing
guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information
quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which
the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under “Segment
Reporting” due to their similar customer base and similarities in economic characteristics; nature of products and services;
and procurement, manufacturing, and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information
required by “Segment Reporting” can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 

 11 
 

 

Stock-Based
Compensation
 
The
Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock, and equity interests as share-based compensation to employees
and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation
– Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value
of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
 
In
prior periods through June 30, 2019, the Company accounted for share-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants
in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505-50, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees . Measurement of share-based
payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or
services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The final fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined
at the performance completion date. For interim periods, the fair value is estimated, and the percentage of completion is applied
to that estimate to determine the cumulative expense recorded.
 
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
 
In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases,
which was subsequently amended in 2018 by ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11 and ASU 2018-20 (collectively, Topic 842). Topic 842 will require
the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease
payments, for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases, the asset and liability will be expensed over
the lease term on a straight-line basis, with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
For finance leases, interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset
in the statement of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified
as a financing activity while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
Topic 842 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 on July 1, 2019, which had no impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures
as the Company does not have leases with terms longer than 12 months.
 
Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company's present or future financial statements.

NOTE
3 – GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE
 
In
May 2009, the Company issued a convertible note payable for $100,000. The note was unsecured, convertible into shares of the Company’s
common stock at $0.30 per share, with interest at 8% per annum, and due November 15, 2010. The note was not paid when due and
the Company went into default on the convertible note payable. The Company continued to accrue interest on the unpaid principal
at 8% per annum, and repaid $10,000 principal in 2014.
 
On
November 13, 2017, the noteholder filed a lawsuit in district court in Hennepin County, Minnesota asserting that the Company breached

promissory note payable to the noteholder was discharged. As the Company was legally released from its obligation under the convertible
note, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of the convertible note payable of $166,921 during the period ended December
31, 2019.

The
Matthews Group is owned 50% by Ms. Tran, the Company’s CEO/Executive Chair and a director, and 50% by Larry Johanns, a significant
stockholder of the Company. The Company has relied on The Matthews Group for funding (see Note 2).
   
Management
Services Agreement and Related Notes Payable with Related Party
 
The
Company’s Barcode Technology was invented by the founders of Veritec as a product identification system for identification
and tracking of parts, components, and products mostly in the liquid crystal display (LCD) markets and for secure identification
documents, financial cards, medical records, and other high-security applications. On December 31, 2015, the Company sold all
of its assets of its Barcode Technology comprised solely of its intellectual property to The Matthews Group. The Company then
entered into a management services agreement with The Matthews Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations,
on behalf of The Matthews Group, through June 30, 2020. The Matthews Group bears the risk of loss from the barcode operations
and has the right to the residual benefits of the barcode operations.
  
In
consideration of the services provided by the Company to The Matthews Group, the Company earned a fee of 20% of all revenues up

ITEM
2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Results
of Operations – Three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to December 31, 2018
 
We
had a net loss of $214,138 in three month period ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $182,597 for the three month
period ended December 31, 2018.
 
Revenues
 
Details
of revenues are as follows:
 

  


 
•
Mobile banking technology

 
Mobile
Banking Technology revenues include products such as the Company’s Blinx On-Off™ prepaid toggle Card and its Open
Loop/Closed Loop System and Bio ID Card Platform. Mobile Banking Technology uses web-based mobile technology to offer financial
cardholders the very best technology in conducting secure financial transactions in real-time, protecting personal identity, and
financial account security. Mobile Banking Technology revenues for the period ended December 31, 2019, and 2018 were $26,014 and
$31,490, respectively. The decrease in Mobile Banking Technology revenues was due to both the conclusion of certain long-term
contracts during the prior year and the Company not having a bank to sponsor its mobile banking solutions since fiscal year 2016
(see Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements).
 


 
•
Other revenue, management
    fee - related party

 
Effective
October 1, 2015, the Company entered into a management services agreement with the Matthews Group for which the Company agreed
to manage its previous barcode technology business, on behalf of the Matthews Group, from October 1, 2015 to June 30, 2020. Per
the terms of the management services agreement, the Company earned 20% of all revenues through May 31, 2017, and 35% of all revenues
through June 30, 2020. For the period ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, revenue earned from the management services agreement
was $45,990 and $50,885, respectively.
 
Cost
of Sales
 
Cost
of sales for the period ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $54,722 and $55,188, respectively. The decrease in the cost of
sales was primarily from expense reductions, including bank sponsor fees, associated with our decline in Mobile Banking Technology
revenues discussed above, as compared to the same period of the prior year.
 
Operating
Expenses
 
General
and administrative expenses for the period ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $143,913 and $135,500, respectively. The decrease

Other
Income (Expenses)
 
On
July 10, 2019, the Company and Plaintiffs entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, whereas, both the
Company and the Plaintiffs agreed to generally discharge and forever release each other from future claims, to pay their own legal
fees, and the promissory note payable to the Plaintiffs was discharged (see Note 4 to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements). During the period ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of convertible
note payable of $166,921.
 
Interest
expense for the period ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $166,957 and $146,477, respectively. The increase was due to the
increase in our notes payable balance.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
Our
cash balance on December 31, 2019 increased to $167,108 as compared to $91,112 on June 30, 2019. The increase was the result of
$205,547 in cash used in operating activities offset by $281,543 in cash provided by financing activities. Net cash used in operations
during the period ended December 31, 2019, was $205,547, compared with $231,594 of net cash used in operations during the same
period of the prior year. Cash used in operations during the period ended December 31, 2019, was primarily from our net loss of
$184,081, reduced by a gain on settlement and extinguishment of a promissory note payable of $166,921, increased by stock-based
compensation expense of $10,070, and general changes to our working capital accounts of $135,385. Net cash provided by financing
activities of $281,543 during the period ended December 31, 2019, was due to proceeds received from notes payable. During the
same period of the prior year, net cash provided by financing activities of $192,590 was from proceeds received from notes payable.
 
The
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period
ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred a loss from operations of $184,081 and used cash in operating activities of $205,547,
and on December 31, 2019, the Company had a working capital deficit of $5,318,388 and a stockholders’ deficiency of $5,473,388.
In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Company is delinquent in payment of $642,511 of its notes payable. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial
statements are issued. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June
30, 2019 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.
 
The
Company believes its cash and forecasted cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to continue operations through fiscal
2020 without continued external investment. The Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through
fiscal 2020 and to continue to develop its existing projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to
purchase the Company’s securities, generating sufficient sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination
thereof. There is no assurance that the Company can be successful in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales or reducing
major costs. Further, if the Company is successful in raising such funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales
may cause significant dilution to existing holders of common stock.
 
The
Company has traditionally been dependent on The Matthews Group, LLC, a related party, for its financial support. The Matthews
Group is owned 50% by Van Tran, the Company’s CEO/Executive Chair and a director, and 50% by Lawrence J. Johanns, a significant
Company stockholder.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
We

Critical
Accounting Policies
 
Revenue
Recognition 
 
The
Company recognized revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”) which
superseded previous revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities
to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with
a customer, (2) identifying the Company’s performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.
 

 20 
 

 

Mobile
Banking Technology Revenue
 
The
Company, as a merchant payment processor and a distributor, recognizes revenue from transaction fees charged to cardholders for
the use of its issued mobile debit cards. The fees are recognized monthly after all cardholder transactions have been summarized
and reconciled with third party processors.
 
The
Company has entered into certain long-term agreements to provide application development and support. Some customers paid the
agreement in full at signing, and the Company recorded the receipt of payment as deferred revenue. The Company records revenue
relating to these agreements on a pro-rata basis over the term of the agreement and reduces its deferred revenue balance accordingly.
 
Other
Revenue, Management Fee - Related Party
 
On
December 31, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology, which was comprised solely of its intellectual
property, to The Matthews Group, a related party (see Note 6). The Company subsequently entered into a management services agreement
with The Matthews Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations through June 30, 2020. The Company earned a
fee of 20% of all revenues billed from the barcode technology operations up to May 31, 2017, and now earns a fee of 35% of all
revenues billed up to June 30, 2020. The Company recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed. 
 
Stock-Based
Compensation
 
The
Company issues stock options and warrants, shares of common stock, and equity interests as share-based compensation to employees
and non-employees. The Company accounts for its share-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation
– Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value
of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
 
In
prior periods through December 31, 2018, the Company accounted for share-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants
in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505-50, Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees . Measurement of share-based
payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or
services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The final fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined
at the performance completion date. For interim periods, the fair value is estimated, and the percentage of completion is applied
to that estimate to determine the cumulative expense recorded.
 
In
June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. The guidance was issued to simplify the accounting for share-based transactions by expanding the scope
of Topic 718 from only being applicable to share-based payments to employees to also include share-based payment transactions
for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. As a result, nonemployee share-based transactions will be measured by estimating
the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date, taking into consideration the probability of satisfying performance
conditions. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 on July 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our
financial statements.

ITEM
4 -- CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 
Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
Date”).  Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that,
as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  As of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance
level due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in our Form 10-K on June 30, 2019.
 
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 
In
our Form 10-K on June 30, 2019, we identified certain matters that constitute material weaknesses (as defined under the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2) in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed on Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  We are undergoing ongoing evaluation and improvements in our internal
control over financial reporting.  Regarding our identified weaknesses, we have performed the following remediation
efforts:
 


 
•
We have assigned
    our audit committee with oversight responsibilities.

 


 
•
Our financial statements,
    periodic reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, our monthly bank statements and imaged
    checks are now continuously reviewed by our chief financial officer and chief executive officer.

 


 
•
All significant
    contracts are now being reviewed and approved by our board of directors in conjunction with the chief executive officer.

 
There
was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that
has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II 
 
ITEM
1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
On
or about November 13, 2017, a noteholder (“Plaintiff”) filed a lawsuit in district court in Hennepin County, Minnesota
asserting that the Company breached the terms of a promissory note. Plaintiff sought repayment on the principal of the promissory
note, in the amount of $100,000, $10,000 of which Plaintiff contend Veritec previously paid, plus interest, collection costs and
attorney’s fees. As of May 15, 2018, the date of the last communication on the amount of recovery from Plaintiff, the Plaintiff
sought an award or settlement in the amount of $162,990. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had recorded a promissory note payable
of $166,921 related to this proceeding.
 
On
July 10, 2019, the Company and Plaintiff entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, whereas, both the Company and
the Plaintiff agreed to generally discharge and forever release each other from future claims, to pay their own legal fees, and
the promissory note payable to the Plaintiff was discharged. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded
a gain on settlement and extinguishment of the promissory note payable of $166,921.
 
On
September 21, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with an individual who was a former officer of the Company. 
The individual in prior years was also issued 500,000 shares of common stock for services.  The Company alleged that the
individual used the Company's intellectual property without approval.   Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the
individual agreed to relinquish a convertible note payable and unpaid interest aggregating $364,686 and return 500,000 shares
of common stock previously issued to him.  In turn, the Company agreed to release and discharge the individual against all
claims arising on or prior to the date of the settlement agreement.  As of June 30, 2019, the 500,000 shares have not been
relinquished. When the Company receives the shares, it will record a cancellation of shares.
