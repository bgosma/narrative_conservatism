NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(UNAUDITED) 
Note 1 — Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the condensed consolidated statements of equity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been prepared by the management of Viasat, Inc. (also referred to hereafter as the Company or Viasat), and have not been audited. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s results for the periods presented. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). 
The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Viasat, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its majority-owned subsidiary, TrellisWare Technologies, Inc. (TrellisWare). During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, Viasat Europe Sàrl (formerly known as Euro Broadband Retail Sàrl), which was previously a majority-owned subsidiary, became a wholly owned subsidiary when the Company purchased the remaining 49% interest in the company for an insignificant amount. All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using the equity method and are included as investment in unconsolidated affiliate in other assets (long-term) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best available information and actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, self-insurance reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty accruals, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, patents, orbital slots and other licenses, software development, property, equipment and satellites, long-lived assets, derivatives, contingencies and income taxes including the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
Revenue recognition 
Effective April 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606). This update established ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers.
The Company applied the five-step model under ASC 606 to its contracts with its customers to determine the impact of the new standard. Under this model the Company (1) identifies the contract with the customer, (2) identifies its performance obligations in the contract, (3) determines the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocates the transaction price to its performance obligations and (5) recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies its performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts.

Performance obligations
 
The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. The Company’s obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). The Company evaluates whether broadband equipment provided to its customers as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with ASC 842. As discussed further below under “Leases - Lessor accounting”, for broadband equipment leased to consumer broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity service arrangements as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.
The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, the Company considers indicators that include, but are not limited to whether (1) the Company has the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.
The vast majority of the Company’s revenues from long-term contracts to develop and deliver complex equipment built to customer specifications are derived from contracts with the U.S. government (including foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government). The Company’s contracts with the U.S. government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of the Company’s U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the Company either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, the Company’s U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which the Company presents as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For the Company’s U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays the Company for its actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, the Company typically receives interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment. The Company recognizes a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and presents it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect the Company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. 
 
Performance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost measure of progress for its contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on its contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined.

Contract costs on U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contracting Management Agency (DCMA), the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and other U.S. government agencies, as well as negotiations with U.S. government representatives. The Company’s incurred cost audits by the DCAA have not been concluded for fiscal year 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the DCAA had completed its incurred cost audit for fiscal years 2004 and 2016 and approved the Company’s incurred costs for those fiscal years, as well as approved the Company’s incurred costs for fiscal years 2005 through 2015, 2017 and 2018 without further audit based on a determination of low risk. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to fiscal year 2018 based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments, and if future adjustments exceed the Company’s estimates, its profitability would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had $6.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in contract-related reserves for its estimate of potential refunds to customers for potential cost adjustments on several multi-year U.S. government cost reimbursable contracts (see Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies for more information).
 
Evaluation of transaction price
 
The evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and, where applicable, the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. The Company’s contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. The Company estimates variable consideration at the amount to which it expects to be entitled. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company’s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, the Company recognizes interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
 
If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, the Company utilizes the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.
 
Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations
 
The Company’s remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm contracts and orders for which work has not been performed. The Company includes in its remaining performance obligations only those contracts and orders for which it has accepted purchase orders. Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company’s subscribers for fixed consumer and business broadband services in its satellite services segment exclude month-to-month service contracts in accordance with a practical expedient and are estimated using a portfolio approach in which the Company reviews all relevant promotional activities and calculates the remaining performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average time remaining under the contract. The Company’s future recurring in-flight connectivity (IFC) service contracts in its satellite services segment do not have minimum service purchase requirements and therefore are not included in the Company’s remaining performance obligations. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $1.9 billion, of which the Company expects to recognize a little over half over the next twelve months, with the balance recognized thereafter.

Disaggregation of revenue
 
The Company operates and manages its business in three reportable segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services, customer type, contract type, and geographic area, respectively, as the Company believes this approach best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. 
 
The following sets forth disaggregated reported revenue by segment and product and services for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
 
 


 
Revenues from the U.S. government as an individual customer comprised approximately 30% of total revenues for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, and approximately 23% and 27% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, mainly reported within the government systems segment. Revenues from the Company’s commercial customers, mainly reported within the commercial networks and satellite services segments, comprised approximately 70% of total revenues for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, and approximately 77% and 73% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. 
 
The Company’s satellite services segment revenues are primarily derived from the Company’s fixed broadband services, IFC services and worldwide managed network services.

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
 
Revenues in the Company’s commercial networks and government systems segments are primarily derived from three types of contracts: fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Fixed-price contracts (which require the Company to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 89% of the Company’s total revenues for these segments for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, and approximately 89% of the Company’s total revenues for these segments for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018. The remainder of the Company’s revenues in these segments for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which the Company is reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit) and from time-and-materials contracts (under which the Company is reimbursed for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract, plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services). 
 
Historically, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues in its commercial networks and government systems segments has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer’s specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for the Company’s funded development from its customer contracts were approximately 24% and 23% of its total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and approximately 18% and 17% of its total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
Revenues by geographic area for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
 


 
The Company distinguishes revenues from external customers by geographic area based on customer location.
 
Contract balances
 
Contract balances consist of contract assets and contract liabilities. A contract asset, or with respect to the Company, an unbilled accounts receivable, is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of the Company’s right to bill and receive consideration, typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts. Unbilled accounts receivable are generally expected to be billed and collected within one year. The unbilled accounts receivable will decrease as provided services or delivered products are billed. The Company receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule established in the Company’s contracts. 
 
When consideration is received in advance of the delivery of goods or services, a contract liability, or with respect to the Company, collections in excess of revenues or deferred revenues, is recorded. Reductions in the collections in excess of revenues or deferred revenues will be recorded as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.
 
The following table presents contract assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019:

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
 
Unbilled accounts receivable increased $14.8 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by revenue recognized in the Company’s government systems segment in excess of billings.
Collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues decreased $5.3 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by revenue recognized in excess of advances on goods or services received in the Company’s government systems and satellite services segments.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $13.5 million and $84.7 million, respectively, that was previously included in the Company’s collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues at March 31, 2019. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $12.6 million and $94.7 million, respectively, that was previously included in the Company’s collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues at April 1, 2018.
Property, equipment and satellites 
Satellites and other property and equipment, including internally developed software, are recorded at cost or, in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentives expected to be payable to satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. The Company also constructs earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support its satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in service, the Company estimates the useful life of its satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite’s performance against the original manufacturer’s orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. Costs incurred for additions to property, equipment and satellites, together with major renewals and betterments, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset. Costs incurred for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations, which for the periods presented, primarily related to losses incurred for unreturned customer premise equipment (CPE). The Company computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to 17 years. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the improvement. 
Costs related to internally developed software for internal uses are capitalized after the preliminary project stage is complete and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are approximately three to seven years. Capitalized costs for internal-use software are included in property, equipment and satellites, net in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Interest expense is capitalized on the carrying value of assets under construction, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the capitalization of interest (ASC 835-20). With respect to the ViaSat-3 class satellites, gateway and networking equipment and other assets under construction, the Company capitalized $14.3 million and $38.6 million of interest expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and $15.6 million and $29.3 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
The Company owns three satellites in service (ViaSat-2 (its second-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018), ViaSat-1 (its first-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, which was placed into service in January 2012) and WildBlue-1 (which was placed into service in March 2007)) and has lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. The Company also has two third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites that have entered the phase of full construction. In July 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company (Boeing) for the construction and purchase of a third ViaSat-3 class satellite and the integration of Viasat’s payload technologies into the satellite. The Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful life of its satellites to determine if revisions to estimated useful lives are necessary. The Company procures indoor and outdoor CPE units leased to subscribers under a retail leasing program as part of the Company’s satellite services segment, which are reflected in investing activities and property, equipment and satellites, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company depreciates the satellites, earth stations and networking equipment, CPE units and related installation costs over their estimated useful lives. The total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in property, equipment and satellites, net, as of December 31, 2019 were $401.7 million and $160.4 million, respectively. The total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in property, equipment and satellites, net, as of March 31, 2019 were $373.4 million and $142.6 million, respectively.

On June 1, 2017, the Company’s second-generation ViaSat-2 satellite was successfully launched into orbit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, shortly before the launch of commercial broadband services on the satellite, the Company reported an antenna deployment issue. The Company worked with the satellite manufacturer to determine the root cause of the antenna deployment issue, potential correcting measures, and resulting damage. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the root cause analysis was completed. Based on that analysis, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a reduction to the carrying value of the ViaSat-2 satellite of $177.4 million, with a corresponding insurance receivable of $177.4 million, based on the Company’s estimated ViaSat-2 output capabilities as compared to the anticipated, potential and configured capacity of the ViaSat-2 satellite. During the first three months of fiscal year 2020, the Company received the remaining insurance proceeds of $2.3 million, which were in addition to the $185.7 million of insurance proceeds received in fiscal year 2019 related to the ViaSat-2 satellite. The ViaSat-2 satellite was primarily financed by the Company’s direct loan facility with the Export-Import Bank of the United States for ViaSat-2 (the Ex-Im Credit Facility) (see Note 7 — Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt for more information). Pursuant to the terms of the Ex-Im Credit Facility, the proceeds received from the insurance claims for ViaSat-2 were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility. 
Occasionally, the Company may enter into finance lease arrangements for various machinery, equipment, computer-related equipment, software, furniture, fixtures, or satellites. The Company records amortization of assets leased under finance lease arrangements within depreciation expense (see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation – Leases and Note 6 – Leases for more information).
Leases
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases, as amended, commonly referred to as ASC 842, on April 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. Under the optional transition method, the Company applied the new guidance to all leases that commenced before and were existing as of April 1, 2019. Accordingly, the Company did not adjust comparative periods or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the adoption date of April 1, 2019.  The primary impact of ASC 842 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the recognition of right-of-use assets and related liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet for operating leases where the Company is the lessee. The Company’s adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on its results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, or on its cash flow for the nine months ended December 31, 2019. 
The Company elected certain practical expedients under its transition method, including the practical expedient package to not reassess (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the classification of existing leases, and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also elected the land easement transition practical expedient, and did not reassess whether an existing or expired land easement is a lease or contains a lease if it has not historically been accounted for as a lease. In addition, for real estate leases, the Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components and instead will account for each separate lease and non-lease component as a single lease component.
The following table presents the summary of the impact of adopting the new standard:

Lessee accounting
For contracts entered into on or after April 1, 2019, the Company assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, the Company determines that a lease exists when (i) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) the Company obtains the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (i) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (iv) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (v) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria. 
At the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying leases. 
Lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (i) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (ii) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (iii) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of the Company’s real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate established at lease commencement. Such payments and changes in payments based on a rate or index are recognized in operating expenses when incurred. 
Lease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the depreciation of assets obtained under finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense on the lease liability based on the discount rate at lease commencement. For both operating and finance leases, lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.
Lessor accounting
For broadband equipment leased to consumer broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, the Company has made an accounting policy election not to separate the broadband equipment from the related connectivity services. The connectivity services are the predominant component of these arrangements. The connectivity services are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. The Company is also a lessor for certain insignificant communications equipment. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.
Patents, orbital slots and other licenses 
The Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining or acquiring patents, orbital slots and other licenses. Amortization of intangible assets that have finite lives is provided for by the straight-line method over the shorter of the legal or estimated economic life. Total capitalized costs of $3.3 million and $3.2 million related to patents were included in other assets as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The Company capitalized costs of $39.3 million and $22.9 million related to acquiring and obtaining orbital slots and other licenses included in other assets as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. Accumulated amortization related to these assets was $3.5 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to these assets was an insignificant amount for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. If a patent, orbital slot or other license is rejected, abandoned or otherwise invalidated, the unamortized cost is expensed in that period. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not write off any significant costs due to abandonment or impairment.

Debt issuance costs 
Debt issuance costs are amortized and recognized as interest expense using the effective interest rate method, or, when the results are not materially different, on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the related debt. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, no debt issuance costs were capitalized. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to extinguished debt are expensed at the time the debt is extinguished and recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Debt issuance costs related to the Company’s revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and in other long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the authoritative guidance for imputation of interest (ASC 835-30). Debt issuance costs related to the Company’s 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes), the Company’s 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes) and the Ex-Im Credit Facility are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, consistent with debt discounts, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for imputation of interest (ASC 835-30). 
Software development 
Costs of developing software for sale are charged to independent research and development expense when incurred, until technological feasibility has been established. Software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility is reached until the product is available for general release to customers are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Once the product is available for general release, the software development costs are amortized based on the ratio of current to future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, generally within five years. Capitalized costs, net, of $241.8 million and $244.4 million related to software developed for resale were included in other assets as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The Company capitalized $13.4 million and $37.0 million of costs related to software developed for resale for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company capitalized $11.7 million and $32.7 million of costs related to software developed for resale for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Amortization expense for capitalized software development costs was $13.9 million and $39.6 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and $11.5 million and $34.6 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. 
Self-insurance liabilities 
The Company has self-insurance plans to retain a portion of the exposure for losses related to employee medical benefits and workers’ compensation. The self-insurance plans include policies which provide for both specific and aggregate stop-loss limits. The Company utilizes internal actuarial methods as well as other historical information for the purpose of estimating ultimate costs for a particular plan year. Based on these actuarial methods, along with currently available information and insurance industry statistics, the Company has recorded self-insurance liability for its plans of $6.0 million and $5.4 million in accrued and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The Company’s estimate, which is subject to inherent variability, is based on average claims experience in the Company’s industry and its own experience in terms of frequency and severity of claims, including asserted and unasserted claims incurred but not reported, with no explicit provision for adverse fluctuation from year to year. This variability may lead to ultimate payments being either greater or less than the amounts presented above. Self-insurance liabilities have been classified as a current liability in accrued and other liabilities in accordance with the estimated timing of the projected payments. 
Indemnification provisions 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company includes indemnification provisions in certain of its contracts, generally relating to parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company will indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses relating to third-party intellectual property claims. To date, there have not been any material costs incurred in connection with such indemnification clauses. The Company’s insurance policies do not necessarily cover the cost of defending indemnification claims or providing indemnification, so if a claim was filed against the Company by any party that the Company has agreed to indemnify, the Company could incur substantial legal costs and damages. A claim would be accrued when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, no such amounts were accrued related to the aforementioned provisions.

Noncontrolling interests 
A noncontrolling interest represents the equity interest in a subsidiary that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the Company and is reported as equity of the Company, separately from the Company’s controlling interest. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements at the consolidated amounts, which include the amounts attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interest. 
Investments in unconsolidated affiliate — equity method 
Investments in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using the equity method and are included as investment in unconsolidated affiliate in other assets (long-term) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company records its share of the results of such entities within equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliate, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company monitors such investments for other-than-temporary impairment by considering factors including the current economic and market conditions and the operating performance of the entities and records reductions in carrying values when necessary. The fair value of privately held investments is estimated using the best available information as of the valuation date, including current earnings trends, undiscounted cash flows, quoted stock prices of comparable public companies, and other company specific information, including recent financing rounds. 
Common stock held in treasury 
As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had no shares of common stock held in treasury. 
During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 932,074 and 863,318 shares of common stock, respectively, based on the vesting terms of certain restricted stock unit agreements. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 1,047,557 and 1,172,049 shares of common stock, respectively, based on the vesting terms of certain restricted stock unit agreements. In order for employees to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements related to the issuance of common stock underlying these restricted stock unit agreements, during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased 340,385 and 314,128 shares of common stock, respectively, at cost and with a total value of $25.1 million and $21.5 million, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased 376,517 and 417,465 shares of common stock, respectively, at cost and with a total value of $28.3 million and $28.1 million, respectively. Although shares withheld for employee withholding taxes are technically not issued, they are treated as common stock repurchases for accounting purposes (with such shares deemed to be repurchased and then immediately retired), as they reduce the number of shares that otherwise would have been issued upon vesting of the restricted stock units. These retired shares remain as authorized stock and are considered to be unissued. The retirement of treasury stock had no impact on the Company’s total consolidated stockholders’ equity.
Derivatives 
The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts from time to time to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in other income (expense) as gains (losses) on derivative instruments. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign currency forward and option contracts which are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction affects the Company’s earnings, at which time they are then recorded in the same income statement line as the underlying transaction. 
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company settled certain foreign exchange contracts and in connection therewith for each period recognized an insignificant gain or loss recorded in cost of revenues based on the nature of the underlying transactions. The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was an insignificant amount recorded as an accrued liability as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019. The notional value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was an insignificant amount as of December 31, 2019 and $9.9 million as of March 31, 2019. 
As of December 31, 2019, the estimated net amount of unrealized gains or losses related to foreign currency forward contracts that was expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next 12 months was insignificant. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2019 will mature within approximately 21 months from their inception. There were no gains or losses from ineffectiveness of these derivative instruments recorded for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Stock-based compensation 
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments (ASC 718), the Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Expense for restricted stock units and stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period. Expense for total shareholder return (TSR) performance stock options that vest is recognized regardless of the actual TSR outcome achieved and is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company recognized $21.9 million and $64.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company recognized $20.2 million and $58.7 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. 
Income taxes 
Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (ASC 740). The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. 
Ordinarily, the Company calculates its provision for income taxes at the end of each interim reporting period on the basis of an estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for tax items that are discrete to each period. However, when a reliable estimate cannot be made, the Company computes its provision for income taxes using the actual effective tax rate (discrete method) for the year-to-date period. The Company’s effective tax rate is highly influenced by the amount of its research and development (R&D) tax credits. A small change in estimated annual pretax income (loss) can produce a significant variance in the annual effective tax rate given the Company’s expected amount of R&D tax credits. This variability provides an unreliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate. As a result, and in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes in interim periods, the Company has computed its provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, by applying the actual effective tax rate to the quarter-to-date and year-to-date income (loss) for the three-month and nine-month periods.
A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax credit and loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
Recent authoritative guidance 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets and eliminates certain real estate-specific provisions. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (ASC 842). ASU 2018-01 permits an entity to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate land easements that exist or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASC 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases under ASC 840. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to ASC 842, Leases, which was issued to provide more detailed guidance and additional clarification for implementing ASU 2016-02. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC 842): Targeted Improvements, which provides an additional (and optional) transition method whereby the new lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20, Leases (ASC 842): Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, and in March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01 (ASC 842): Codification Improvements, both of which provide certain amendments that affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2016-02. The Company adopted the new guidance using the optional transition method in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Therefore, the periods prior to the effective date of adoption continue to be reported under the current authoritative guidance for leases (ASC 840). The adoption of this guidance materially impacted the Company’s consolidated balance sheet upon adoption due to the recognition of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation – Leases and Note 6 — Leases for more information).

 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (ASC 326). ASU 2016-13 requires credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model). It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC 326), which clarifies that impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. In April 2019 the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, in May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (ASC 326) Targeted Relief, and in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. These recently issued ASUs do not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU 2016-13 but rather are intended to clarify and improve operability of certain topics included within ASU 2016-13. ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05 and ASU 2019-11 have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2016-13. The new guidance will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance is required to be applied on a modified-retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASC 350). ASU 2017-04 removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The standard will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables — Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (ASC 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities. ASU 2017-08 amends the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. The amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP. The amendments in this update better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and presentation of hedge results. In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index SWAP (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes, which permits use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes and has the same effective date as ASU 2017-12. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which clarifies certain aspects of ASC 815 and has the same effective date as ASU 2017-12. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements, which is related to a project by the FASB to facilitate codification updates for technical corrections, clarifications and other minor improvements. The new standard contains amendments that affect a wide variety of topics in the ASC. The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some amendments do not require transition guidance and were effective upon the issuance of this standard. A majority of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 became effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020. The Company adopted the remainder of the amendments of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Note 3 — Fair Value Measurements 
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (ASC 820), the Company determines fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, and prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value from market-based assumptions to entity specific assumptions: 




 

•

Level 1 — Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. 




 

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 




 

•

Level 3 — Inputs which reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation. 
The Company had $5.0 million in cash equivalents (Level 1) and no assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The Company had an insignificant amount of foreign currency forward contract liabilities (Level 2) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019. 
 
The following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure financial instruments at fair value: 
Cash equivalents — The Company’s cash equivalents consist of money market funds. Money market funds are valued using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions (Level 1). 
Foreign currency forward contracts — The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk relating to foreign exchange rates. The Company does not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company’s objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and are measured at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivative instruments are recorded to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) depending on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are valued using standard calculations/models that are primarily based on observable inputs, such as foreign currency exchange rates, or can be corroborated by observable market data (Level 2). 
Long-term debt — The Company’s long-term debt consists of borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility and Ex-Im Credit Facility (collectively, the Credit Facilities), finance lease obligations reported at the present value of future minimum lease payments with current accrued interest, as well as $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes and $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes. Long-term debt related to the Revolving Credit Facility is reported at the outstanding principal amount of borrowings, while long-term debt related to the Ex-Im Credit Facility, 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes is reported at amortized cost. However, for disclosure purposes, the Company is required to measure the fair value of outstanding debt on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding long-term debt related to the 2025 Notes was determined based on actual or estimated bids and offers for the 2025 Notes in an over-the-counter market (Level 2) and was $721.0 million and $670.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding long-term debt related to the 2027 Notes was determined based on actual or estimated bids and offers for the 2027 Notes in an over-the-counter market (Level 2) and was $641.9 million. The fair value of the Company’s outstanding long-term debt as of March 31, 2019 related to the 2027 Notes approximated its carrying amount due to the proximity of the closing of the 2027 Notes compared to the reporting date. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt related to the Revolving Credit Facility approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate, which approximates a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt related to the Ex-Im Credit Facility was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using observable market interest rates for instruments with similar terms (Level 2) and was approximately $117.0 million and $134.9 million, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s finance lease obligations is estimated at their carrying value based on current rates (Level 2).

Satellite performance incentive obligations — The Company’s contracts with the manufacturers of the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites require the Company to make monthly in-orbit satellite performance incentive payments, including interest, through approximately fiscal year 2028 subject to the continued satisfactory performance of the applicable satellites. The Company records the net present value of these expected future payments as a liability and as a component of the cost of the satellites. However, for disclosure purposes, the Company is required to measure the fair value of outstanding satellite performance incentive obligations on a recurring basis. The fair value of the Company’s outstanding satellite performance incentive obligations is estimated to approximate their carrying value based on current rates (Level 2). As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company’s estimated satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites, including accrued interest, were $27.9 million and $28.2 million, respectively.

The weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Viasat, Inc. common stockholders is the same for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, as the Company incurred a net loss attributable to Viasat, Inc. common stockholders for such periods and inclusion of potentially dilutive weighted average shares of common stock would be antidilutive. Potentially dilutive weighted average shares excluded from the calculation for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 consisted of 201,761 shares related to stock options (other than TSR performance stock options), 910,494 shares related to TSR performance stock options, 949,324 shares related to restricted stock units, and 230,588 shares related to certain terms of the ViaSat 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Potentially dilutive weighted average shares excluded from the calculation for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 consisted of 1,276,242 and 1,297,427 shares related to stock options (other than TSR performance stock options), respectively, 630,102 and 498,062 shares related to TSR performance stock options, respectively, 1,101,149 and 707,353 shares related to restricted stock units, respectively, and 289,006 and 249,077 shares related to certain terms of the ViaSat 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively.

Note 5 — Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 
During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the increase in the Company’s goodwill related to the effects of foreign currency translation recorded within all three of the Company’s segments. During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, the increase in the Company’s goodwill related to an insignificant acquisition, partially offset by the effects of foreign currency translation recorded within all three of the Company’s segments. 
Other acquired intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years. Amortization expense related to other acquired intangible assets was $1.9 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $5.9 million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
The expected amortization expense of amortizable acquired intangible assets may change due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations as a result of international businesses acquired. Current and expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows: 
 


 
Note 6 – Leases
The Company’s operating leases consist primarily of leases for office space, data centers and satellite ground facilities and have remaining terms from less than one year to ten years, some of which include renewal options, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year. Certain earth station leases have renewal terms that have been deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised and as such have been recognized as part of the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for such leases in connection with its adoption of ASC 842 as of April 1, 2019 (see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation — Leases for more information). The Company reports operating lease right-of-use assets in operating lease right-of-use assets and the current and non-current portions of its operating lease liabilities in accrued and other liabilities and non-current operating lease liabilities, respectively. 
The Company’s finance leases consist primarily of satellite lifetime Ka-band capacity leases and have remaining terms from one to seven years. The Company reports assets obtained under finance leases in property, equipment and satellites, net and the current and non-current portions of its finance lease liabilities in current portion of long-term debt and other long-term debt, respectively.

Note 7 — Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt 
Total long-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019: 
 


 
Revolving Credit Facility 
As of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility provided a $700.0 million revolving line of credit (including up to $150.0 million of letters of credit), with a maturity date of January 18, 2024. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $110.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $27.6 million outstanding under standby letters of credit, leaving borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 of $562.4 million.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (1) the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, or the administrative agent’s prime rate as announced from time to time, or (2) the Eurodollar rate, plus, in the case of each of (1) and (2), an applicable margin that is based on the Company’s total leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average effective interest rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.28%. The Company has capitalized certain amounts of interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the construction of various assets during the construction period. The Revolving Credit Facility is required to be guaranteed by certain significant domestic subsidiaries of the Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and secured by substantially all of the Company’s and any such subsidiaries’ assets. As of December 31, 2019, none of the Company’s subsidiaries guaranteed the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants regarding a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that restrict, among other things, the Company’s ability to sell assets, make investments and acquisitions, make capital expenditures, grant liens, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019.
Ex-Im Credit Facility 
The Ex-Im Credit Facility originally provided a $362.4 million senior secured direct loan facility, which was fully drawn. Of the $362.4 million in principal amount of borrowings made under the Ex-Im Credit Facility, $321.2 million was used to finance up to 85% of the costs of construction, launch and insurance of the ViaSat-2 satellite and related goods and services (including costs incurred on or after September 18, 2012), with the remaining $41.2 million used to finance the total exposure fees incurred under the Ex-Im Credit Facility (which included all previously accrued completion exposure fees). As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $117.9 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility. 
Borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.38%, payable semi-annually in arrears. The effective interest rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility, which takes into account timing and amount of borrowings and payments, exposure fees, debt issuance costs and other fees, is 4.54%. Borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility are required to be repaid in 16 semi-annual principal installments, which commenced on April 15, 2018, with a maturity date of October 15, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of the Ex-Im Credit Facility, certain insurance proceeds related to the ViaSat-2 satellite must be used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility upon receipt. During the first three months of fiscal year 2020, the Company received the remaining insurance proceeds of $2.3 million, which were in addition to the $185.7 million of insurance proceeds received in fiscal year 2019 related to the ViaSat-2 satellite, all of which were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility upon receipt (see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation – Property, equipment and satellites for more information). The Ex-Im Credit Facility is guaranteed by Viasat and is secured by first-priority liens on the ViaSat-2 satellite and related assets, as well as a pledge of the capital stock of the borrower under the facility. 
The Ex-Im Credit Facility contains financial covenants regarding Viasat’s maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the Ex-Im Credit Facility contains covenants that restrict, among other things, the Company’s ability to sell assets, make investments and acquisitions, make capital expenditures, grant liens, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Ex-Im Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019. 
Borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility are recorded as current portion of long-term debt and as other long-term debt, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The discount of $42.3 million (consisting of the initial $6.0 million pre-exposure fee, $35.3 million of completion exposure fees, and other customary fees) and deferred financing cost associated with the issuance of the borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility are amortized to interest expense on an effective interest rate basis over the weighted average term of the Ex-Im Credit Facility and in accordance with the related payment obligations. 
Senior Notes 
Senior Secured Notes due 2027
In March 2019, the Company issued $600.0 million in principal amount of 2027 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2027 Notes were issued at face value and are recorded as long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The 2027 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.625% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments commenced in October 2019. Debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2027 Notes are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2027 Notes, the results of which are not materially different from the effective interest rate basis. 
The 2027 Notes are required to be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, none of the Company’s subsidiaries guaranteed the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes are secured, equally and ratably with the Revolving Credit Facility and any future parity lien debt, by liens on substantially all of the Company’s assets.

The 2027 Notes are the Company’s general senior secured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future unsubordinated debt. The 2027 Notes are effectively senior to all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured debt (including the 2025 Notes) as well as to all of any permitted junior lien debt that may be incurred in the future, in each case to the extent of the value of the assets securing the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes are effectively subordinated to any obligations that are secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the collateral securing the 2027 Notes, are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2027 Notes (including obligations of the borrower under the Ex-Im Credit Facility), and are senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness.
The indenture governing the 2027 Notes limits, among other things, the Company’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to: incur, assume or guarantee additional debt; issue redeemable stock and preferred stock; pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; make loans and investments; grant or incur liens; restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; reduce the Company’s satellite insurance; and consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of their assets to, another person. 
Prior to April 15, 2022, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the 2027 Notes at a redemption price of 105.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, from the net cash proceeds of specified equity offerings. The Company may also redeem the 2027 Notes prior to April 15, 2022, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable premium and any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. The applicable premium is calculated as the greater of: (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such 2027 Notes and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such date of redemption of (1) the redemption price of such 2027 Notes on April 15, 2022 plus (2) all required interest payments due on such 2027 Notes through April 15, 2022 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the date of redemption), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate (as defined under the indenture governing the 2027 Notes) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the then-outstanding principal amount of such 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time during the 12 months beginning on April 15, 2022 at a redemption price of 102.813%, during the 12 months beginning on April 15, 2023 at a redemption price of 101.406%, and at any time on or after April 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100%, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. In the event a change of control triggering event occurs (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes), each holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s 2027 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
 
Senior Notes due 2025
In September 2017, the Company issued $700.0 million in principal amount of 2025 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2025 Notes were issued at face value and are recorded as long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The 2025 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.625% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments commenced in March 2018. Debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2025 Notes are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2025 Notes, the results of which are not materially different from the effective interest rate basis. 
The 2025 Notes are required to be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, none of the Company’s subsidiaries guaranteed the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are the Company’s general senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured unsubordinated debt. The 2025 Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future secured debt, including under the Credit Facilities and the 2027 Notes (to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt), are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2025 Notes, and are senior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future subordinated indebtedness. 
The indenture governing the 2025 Notes limits, among other things, the Company’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to: incur, assume or guarantee additional debt; issue redeemable stock and preferred stock; pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; make loans and investments; grant or incur liens; restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; reduce the Company’s satellite insurance; and consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of their assets to, another person.

Note 8 — Product Warranty 
The Company provides limited warranties on its products for periods of up to five years. The Company records a liability for its warranty obligations when products are shipped or they are included in long-term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs. Amounts expected to be incurred within 12 months are classified as accrued liabilities and amounts expected to be incurred beyond 12 months are classified as other liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For mature products, the warranty cost estimates are based on historical experience with the particular product. For newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs, the Company bases its estimates on its experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur. It is possible that the Company’s underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience and, in that case, future adjustments will be made to the recorded warranty obligation. The following table reflects the change in the Company’s warranty accrual during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: 
 


 
Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies 
In July 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Boeing for the construction and purchase of a third ViaSat-3 class satellite and the integration of Viasat’s payload technologies into the satellite. This satellite is expected to provide broadband services over the Asia and Pacific (APAC) region.
 
From time to time, the Company is involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including government investigations and claims, and other claims and proceedings with respect to intellectual property, breach of contract, labor and employment, tax and other matters. Such matters could result in fines; penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages; or non-monetary relief. A violation of government contract laws and regulations could also result in the termination of its government contracts or debarment from bidding on future government contracts. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of its current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company has contracts with various U.S. government agencies. Accordingly, the Company is routinely subject to audit and review by the DCMA, the DCAA and other U.S. government agencies of its performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, accounting and management internal control business systems, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. An adverse outcome to a review or audit or other failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could result in material civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions being imposed on the Company, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, significant customer refunds, fines and suspension, or a prohibition on doing business with U.S. government agencies. In addition, if the Company fails to obtain an “adequate” determination of its various accounting and management internal control business systems from applicable U.S. government agencies or if allegations of impropriety are made against it, the Company could suffer serious harm to its business or its reputation, including its ability to bid on new contracts or receive contract renewals and its competitive position in the bidding process. The Company’s incurred cost audits by the DCAA have not been concluded for fiscal year 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the DCAA had completed its incurred cost audit for fiscal years 2004 and 2016 and approved the Company’s incurred costs for those fiscal years, as well as approved the Company’s incurred costs for fiscal years 2005 through 2015, 2017 and 2018 without further audit based on the determination of low risk. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to fiscal year 2018 based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments, and if future adjustments exceed the Company’s estimates, its profitability would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had $6.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in contract-related reserves for its estimate of potential refunds to customers for potential cost adjustments on several multi-year U.S. government cost reimbursable contracts. This reserve is classified as either an element of accrued liabilities or as a reduction of unbilled accounts receivable based on the status of the related contracts. 
 
Note 10 — Income Taxes 
Ordinarily, the Company calculates its provision for income taxes at the end of each interim reporting period on the basis of an estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for tax items that are discrete to each period. However, when a reliable estimate cannot be made, the Company computes its provision for income taxes using the actual effective tax rate (discrete method) for the year-to-date period. The Company’s effective tax rate is highly influenced by the amount of its R&D tax credits. A small change in estimated annual pretax income (loss) can produce a significant variance in the annual effective tax rate given the Company’s expected amount of R&D tax credits. This variability provides an unreliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate. As a result, and in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes in interim periods, the Company has computed its provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 by applying the actual effective tax rate to the quarter-to-date and year-to-date income (loss) for the three-month and nine-month periods. 
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively, resulting in effective tax benefit rates of negative 80% and positive 211%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of federal and state R&D tax credits. 
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.2 million and an income tax benefit of $35.7 million, respectively, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 36% and an effective tax benefit rate of 32%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of federal and state R&D tax credits, offset by an increase in valuation allowances on state net operating losses and state R&D tax credits.
Future realization of existing deferred tax assets ultimately depends on future profitability and the existence of sufficient taxable income of appropriate character (for example, ordinary income versus capital gains) within the carryforward period available under tax law. In the event that the Company’s estimate of taxable income is less than that required to utilize the full amount of any deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is established, which would cause a decrease to income in the period such determination is made. 
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $3.6 million and $10.0 million, respectively. In the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not change significantly.

Note 11 — Equity Method Investments and Related-Party Transactions 
Eutelsat strategic partnering arrangement 
In March 2017, the Company acquired a 49% interest in Euro Broadband Infrastructure Sàrl (Euro Infrastructure Co.) for $139.5 million as part of the consummation of the Company’s strategic partnering arrangement with Eutelsat. The Company’s investment in Euro Infrastructure Co. is accounted for under the equity method and the total investment, including basis difference allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, deferred income taxes and goodwill, is classified as a single line item, as an investment in unconsolidated affiliate, on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Because the underlying net assets in Euro Infrastructure Co. and the related excess carrying value of investment over the proportionate share of net assets are denominated in Euros, foreign currency translation gains or losses impact the recorded value of the Company’s investment. The Company recorded foreign currency translation losses, net of tax, of approximately $4.2 million and $5.0 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recorded foreign currency translation losses, net of tax, of an insignificant amount and $3.8 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company records its proportionate share of the results of Euro Infrastructure Co., and any related basis difference amortization expense, within equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliate, net, one quarter in arrears. Accordingly, the Company included its share of the results of Euro Infrastructure Co. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 in its condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and the Company included its share of the results of Euro Infrastructure Co. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 in its condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company’s investment in Euro Infrastructure Co. is presented at cost of investment plus its accumulated proportional share of income or loss, including amortization of the difference in the historical basis of the Company’s contribution, less any distributions it has received. 
The difference between the Company’s carrying value of its investment in Euro Infrastructure Co. and its proportionate share of the net assets of Euro Infrastructure Co. as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 is summarized as follows: 
 


 
The identifiable intangible assets have useful lives of up to 11 years and a weighted average useful life of approximately ten years, and tangible assets have useful lives of up to 11 years and a weighted average useful life of approximately 11 years. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
The Company’s share of income on its investment in Euro Infrastructure Co. was income of $1.8 million and $4.3 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and income of $1.4 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, consisting of the Company’s share of equity in Euro Infrastructure Co.’s income, including amortization of the difference in the historical basis of the Company’s contribution. 
Since acquiring its interest in Euro Infrastructure Co., the Company has recorded $10.7 million in retained earnings of undistributed cumulative earnings in equity interests, net of tax, as of December 31, 2019.

Company Overview 
We are an innovator in communications technologies and services. Our end-to-end platform of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions to enterprises, consumers and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, on the move or in flight. In addition, we develop and provide advanced wireless communications systems, military tactical data link systems, secure networking systems and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. Our product, system and service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies, customer applications and market relationships. We believe that our portfolio of products and services, combined with our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial segments and across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies. Viasat, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1986, and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996. 
We conduct our business through three segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems. 
35

 
Satellite Services 
Our satellite services segment uses our proprietary technology platform to provide satellite-based high-speed broadband services with multiple applications to consumers, enterprises and mobile broadband customers (including commercial airlines and maritime vessels) both in the United States and abroad. Our Viasat Internet and Viasat Business Internet fixed broadband services offer high-speed, high-quality broadband internet access. For commercial aircraft, we offer high-speed internet and other in-flight services, including our wireless in-flight entertainment (W-IFE) platform. Our Community and Urban Wi-Fi hotspot services provide satellite-powered Wi-Fi to rural, suburban and urban areas in a number of countries in the Americas.
Our proprietary Ka-band satellites are at the core of our technology platform. We own three Ka-band satellites in service: ViaSat-2 (our second-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot beam satellite, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018), ViaSat-1 (our first-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, which was placed into service in January 2012), and WildBlue-1 (which was placed into service in March 2007) and have lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. We also have two third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites that have entered the phase of full construction. In July 2019, we entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company (Boeing) for the construction and purchase of a third ViaSat-3 class satellite and the integration of Viasat’s payload technologies into the satellite.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, shortly before the launch of commercial broadband services on our ViaSat-2 satellite, we reported an antenna deployment issue. We worked with the satellite manufacturer to determine the root cause of the antenna deployment issue, potential correcting measures, and resulting damage. In fiscal year 2019, we filed insurance claims for resulting damages and collected most of the claims. Pursuant to the terms of our direct loan facility with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Ex-Im Credit Facility) used to finance the ViaSat-2 satellite, insurance proceeds received from such claims were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility (see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation – Property, equipment and satellites to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information).
The primary services offered by our satellite services segment are comprised of: 




 

•

Fixed broadband services, which provide consumers and businesses with high-speed broadband internet access and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.

Sources of Revenues 
Our satellite services segment revenues are primarily derived from our fixed broadband services, in-flight services (including services using our IFC systems and W-IFE platform) and worldwide managed network services. 
Revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments are primarily derived from three types of contracts: fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Fixed-price contracts (which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 89% of our total revenues for these segments for both the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and approximately 89% of our total revenues for these segments for both the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The remainder of our revenues in these segments for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit) and from time-and-materials contracts (which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract, plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services). 
Our ability to grow and maintain our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has to date depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution, and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards. Due to the nature of this process, it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets. 
37

 
Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer’s specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for our funded development from our customer contracts were approximately 24% and 18% of our total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately 23% and 17% of our total revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
We also incur IR&D expenses, which are not directly funded by a third party. IR&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies, prototype materials, testing and certification related to research and development (R&D) projects. IR&D expenses were approximately 5% of total revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and approximately 6% of total revenues during both the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As a government contractor, we are able to recover a portion of our IR&D expenses pursuant to our government contracts. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment. 
Revenue recognition 
We apply the five-step revenue recognition model under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606) to our contracts with our customers. Under this model we (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts.
 
The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. Our obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). We evaluate whether broadband equipment provided to our customer as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with ASC 842. As discussed in Note 1 – Basis of Presentation – Leases to our condensed consolidated financial statements, for broadband equipment leased to consumer broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we account for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity services arrangement as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.
We also derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, we consider indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) we have the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.
 
38

 
The vast majority of our revenues from long-term contracts to develop and deliver complex equipment built to customer specifications are derived from contracts with the U.S. government (including foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government). Our contracts with the U.S. government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. 
 
Performance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.  When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. A one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed-price contracts as of December 31, 2019 would change our income (loss) before income taxes by an insignificant amount.
 
The evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and where applicable the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Our contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, we recognize interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. We have elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
 
If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, we utilize the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.
39

 
Warranty reserves 
We provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years. We record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long-term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs. Amounts expected to be incurred within 12 months are classified as accrued liabilities and amounts expected to be incurred beyond 12 months are classified as other liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. For mature products, we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product. For newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs, we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur. It is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience, and in that case, we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation. 
Property, equipment and satellites 
Satellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentive payments expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. We also construct earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in service, we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite’s performance against the original manufacturer’s orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. 
We own three satellites in service (ViaSat-2 (our second-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018), ViaSat-1 (our first-generation high-capacity Ka-band spot-beam satellite, which was placed into service in January 2012) and WildBlue-1 (which was placed into service in March 2007)) and have lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. We also have two third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites that have entered the phase of full construction. In July 2019, we entered into an agreement with Boeing for the construction and purchase of a third ViaSat-3 class satellite and the integration of Viasat’s payload technologies into the satellite. In addition, we own related earth stations and networking equipment for all of our satellites. Property, equipment and satellites, net also includes the CPE units leased to subscribers under a retail leasing program as part of our satellite services segment.
Leases
We assess at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, we determine that a lease exists when (i) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) we obtain the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (iii) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (i) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (iv) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (v) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria. 
Starting at April 1, 2019, at the lease commencement date, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying leases. 
Lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (i) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (ii) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (iii) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of our real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate established at lease commencement. Such payments and changes in payments based on a rate or index are recognized in operating expenses when incurred. 
40

 
Lease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the depreciation of assets obtained under finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense on the lease liability based on the discount rate at lease commencement. For both operating and finance leases, lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.
For broadband equipment leased to consumer broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we have made an accounting policy election not to separate the broadband equipment from the related connectivity services. The connectivity services are the predominant component of these arrangements.  The connectivity services are accounted for in accordance ASC 606. We are also a lessor for certain insignificant communications equipment. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.
Impairment of long-lived and other long-term assets (property, equipment and satellites, and other assets, including goodwill) 
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), we assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, including property, equipment and satellites and other assets, when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of the satellite to determine if revisions to the estimated useful life are necessary. We recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) are less than the asset’s carrying value. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. No material impairments were recorded by us for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 
We account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets (ASC 350) and the provisions of ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which simplifies how we test goodwill for impairment. Current authoritative guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value, resulting in goodwill impairment. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. 
The qualitative analysis includes assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including: (1) changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections, (2) changes in the industry or our competitive environment since the acquisition date, (3) changes in the overall economy, our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date, (4) trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values, (5) trends in peer companies total enterprise value metrics, and (6) additional factors such as management turnover, changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters. 
Based on our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of March 31, 2019 and, therefore, determined it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. 
Income taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
Management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to determine if the weight of available evidence suggests that an additional valuation allowance is needed. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes (ASC 740), net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event that our estimate of taxable income is less than that required to utilize the full amount of any deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is established, which would cause a decrease to income in the period such determination is made. Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased from $33.5 million at March 31, 2019 to $40.0 million at December 31, 2019. The valuation allowance relates to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, state R&D tax credit carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. 
41

 
Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets considered historical as well as forecasted future operating results. In addition, our evaluation considered other factors, including our contractual backlog, our history of positive earnings, current earnings trends assuming our satellite services segment continues to grow, taxable income adjusted for certain items, and forecasted income by jurisdiction. We also considered the period over which these net deferred tax assets can be realized and our history of not having federal tax loss carryforwards expire unused. 
Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (ASC 740). Under the authoritative guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. 
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business, there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision. We believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal, state and foreign tax authorities. However, if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, an additional charge to expense would result. 
Results of Operations 
The following table presents, as a percentage of total revenues, income statement data for the periods indicated: 
 


 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended December 31, 2018
Revenues 
 


 
42

 
Our total revenues grew by $33.5 million as a result of a $32.3 million increase in service revenues and a $1.2 million increase in product revenues. The service revenue increase was due to an increase of $34.0 million in our satellite services segment, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in our government systems segment. The product revenue increase was driven primarily by an increase of $43.5 million in our government systems segment, partially offset by a decrease in product revenues of $42.2 million in our commercial networks segment.
 
Cost of revenues 
 


 
The slight increase in cost of revenues compared to the prior year period was due to an increase of $13.4 million in cost of service revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $11.9 million in cost of product revenues. The cost of service revenue increase primarily related to increased revenues, mainly from revenue increases in our satellite services segment, causing a $22.6 million increase in cost of service revenues on a constant margin basis. The increase in cost of service revenues was partially offset by improved margins, primarily driven by our fixed broadband services and in-flight internet services in our satellite services segment. The cost of product revenue decrease was primarily due to improved margins, mainly from tactical satcom radio products in our government systems segment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 


 
The $21.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses was primarily due to an increase in support costs of $21.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in selling costs of $3.8 million. The increase in support costs was reflected in all three segments, and the decrease in selling costs was driven by our satellite services segment. Additionally, in the prior year period we recorded a gain of approximately $4.0 million related to our ViaSat-2 satellite insurance claims recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses in our satellite services segment. SG&A expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development, marketing and sales, bid and proposal, facilities, finance, contract administration and general management.
Independent research and development 
 


 
The $3.2 million increase in IR&D expenses was primarily the result of an increase of $4.6 million in IR&D efforts in our commercial networks segment (primarily related to an increase in IR&D expenses related to next-generation satellite payload technologies and mobile broadband satellite communications systems), partially offset by a decrease of $1.3 million in our government systems segment. 
43

 
Amortization of acquired intangible assets 
We amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to ten years. The slight decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of certain acquired intangibles in our satellite services segment becoming fully amortized during the prior fiscal year. Current and expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows: 
 


 
Interest income 
The slight increase in interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was the result of higher average invested cash balances during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior year period. 
Interest expense 
The $5.6 million decrease in interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense attributable to the Ex-Im Credit Facility, as the insurance recovery proceeds related to the ViaSat-2 satellite were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in interest expense attributable to the 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes), which were issued in March 2019.  
Income taxes 
For the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.9 million, resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of negative 80%. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $3.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 36%. The effective tax rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of federal and state R&D tax credits.
Ordinarily, the effective tax rate at the end of an interim period is calculated using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. However, when a reliable estimate cannot be made, we compute our provision for income taxes using the actual effective tax rate (discrete method) for the year-to-date period. Our effective tax rate is highly influenced by the amount of our R&D tax credits. A small change in estimated annual pretax income (loss) can produce a significant variance in the annual effective tax rate given our expected amount of R&D tax credits. This variability provides an unreliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate. As a result, and in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes in interim periods, we have computed our provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2019 by applying the actual effective tax rate to the quarter-to-date income for the three-month period.
Segment Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended December 31, 2018
Satellite services segment 
Revenues 
 


44

 
 
Our satellite services segment revenues increased by $34.0 million due to an increase in service revenues. The increase in service revenues was primarily driven by the expansion of our fixed broadband services and in-flight internet services. The fixed broadband service revenue increase was driven by higher average revenue per fixed broadband subscriber in the United States when compared to the same period last fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of new and existing subscribers choosing Viasat’s premium highest speed plans. Total subscribers at December 31, 2019 were approximately 586,000 compared to 584,000 subscribers at December 31, 2018. The in-flight service revenue increase was driven primarily by the increase in the number of commercial aircraft receiving our in-flight services through our IFC systems, with 1,379 commercial aircraft in service utilizing our IFC systems as of December 31, 2019, compared to 1,123 commercial aircraft in service as of December 31, 2018. 
Segment operating profit (loss)
 


 
The change from satellite services segment operating loss to operating profit was driven primarily by higher earnings contributions of $23.8 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues and improved margins from our fixed broadband services and in-flight internet services as services scaled efficiently, partially offset by higher support costs and our investments in global broadband businesses.
Commercial networks segment 
Revenues 
 


 
Our commercial networks segment revenues decreased by $42.3 million, primarily due to a $42.2 million decrease in product revenues. The decrease in product revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $46.5 million in mobile broadband satellite communication systems products as IFC terminal deliveries returned to more normalized levels, following accelerated deliveries in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $4.3 million in fixed satellite networks products. 
Segment operating loss 
 


 
45

 
The $15.7 million increase in our commercial networks segment operating loss was driven primarily by lower earnings contributions of $7.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in revenues of our mobile broadband satellite communication systems products. Additionally the segment experienced a $4.6 million increase in IR&D expenses (primarily related to next-generation satellite payload technologies and mobile broadband satellite communications systems) and a $3.3 million increase in SG&A costs. 
Government systems segment 
Revenues 
 


 
Our government systems segment revenues increased by $41.7 million due to an increase of $43.5 million in product revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in service revenues. The product revenue increase was due to a $24.4 million increase in tactical satcom radio products, a $14.0 million increase in government mobile broadband products, a $10.3 million increase in tactical data link products, and a $6.1 million increase in government satellite communication systems products, partially offset by a decrease of $11.2 million in cybersecurity and information assurance products. The service revenue decrease was primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in government satellite communication systems services.
 
Segment operating profit 
 


 
The $9.2 million increase in our government systems segment operating profit was primarily due to higher earnings contributions of $16.0 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues in our tactical satcom radio products, government mobile broadband products and tactical data link products, and improved margins from our tactical satcom radio products. This increase was partially offset by higher SG&A costs of $8.1 million. 
Nine Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2018 
Revenues 
 


 
46

 
Our total revenues grew by $206.5 million as a result of a $133.4 million increase in service revenues and a $73.1 million increase in product revenues. The service revenue increase was due to increases of $120.1 million in our satellite services segment, $7.7 million in our commercial networks segment and $5.6 million in our government systems segment. The product revenue increase was driven primarily by an increase of $165.6 million in our government systems segment, partially offset by a decrease in product revenues of $92.5 million in our commercial networks segment.
Cost of revenues 
 


 
Cost of revenues increased by $59.1 million due to increases of $41.3 million in cost of service revenues and $17.7 million in cost of product revenues. The cost of service revenue increase primarily related to increased revenues, mainly from our satellite services segment, causing a $98.2 million increase in cost of service revenues on a constant margin basis. The increase in cost of service revenues was partially offset by improved margins, primarily driven by our fixed broadband services and in-flight internet services in our satellite services segment. The cost of product revenue increase was primarily due to increased revenues, causing a $56.3 million increase in cost of product revenues on a constant margin basis mainly from revenue increases in our government systems segment, partially offset by decreased revenues in our commercial networks segment. The increase in cost of product revenues was partially offset by improved margins, driven primarily by our tactical satcom radio products, cybersecurity and information assurance products and government satellite communication systems products in our government systems segment and our satellite networking development program products in our commercial networks segment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 


 
The $48.2 million increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to an increase in support costs of $45.6 million, which was reflected in all three segments. Additionally, in the prior year period we recorded a gain of approximately $4.0 million related to our ViaSat-2 satellite insurance claims recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses in our satellite services segment. SG&A expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development, marketing and sales, bid and proposal, facilities, finance, contract administration and general management. 
Independent research and development
 


 
The $6.3 million increase in IR&D expenses was primarily due to an increase in IR&D efforts in our commercial networks segment (primarily related to an increase in IR&D expenses related to next-generation satellite payload technologies and mobile broadband satellite communications systems).

Amortization of acquired intangible assets
We amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to ten years. The $1.5 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of certain acquired intangibles in our satellite services segment becoming fully amortized during the prior fiscal year. Current and expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows: 
 


 
Interest income
The $1.4 million increase in interest income for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was the result of higher average invested cash balances during the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior year period.
Interest expense
The $10.3 million decrease in interest expense in the nine months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period was primarily related to a decrease in interest expense attributable to the Ex-Im Credit Facility, as the insurance recovery proceeds related to the ViaSat-2 satellite were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility in the prior year period, coupled with an increase in the amount of interest capitalized. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest expense attributable to the 2027 Notes, which were issued in March 2019. Capitalized interest expense during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 related to the construction of our ViaSat-3 class satellites, gateway and networking equipment and other assets.
Income taxes
For the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $8.7 million, resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of 211%. For the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit of $35.7 million, resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of 32%. The effective tax benefit rates for the periods differed from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to the benefit of federal and state R&D tax credits. 
Ordinarily, the effective tax rate at the end of an interim period is calculated using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. However, when a reliable estimate cannot be made, we compute our provision for income taxes using the actual effective tax rate (discrete method) for the year-to-date period. Our effective tax rate is highly influenced by the amount of our R&D tax credits. A small change in estimated annual pretax income (loss) can produce a significant variance in the annual effective tax rate given our expected amount of R&D tax credits. This variability provides an unreliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate. As a result, and in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes in interim periods, we have computed our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 by applying the actual effective tax rate to the year-to-date income (loss) for the nine-month period.

Segment Results for the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2018
Satellite services segment 
Revenues 
 


 
Our satellite services segment revenues increased by $120.1 million due to an increase in service revenues. The increase in service revenues was primarily driven by the expansion of our fixed broadband services and in-flight internet services. The fixed broadband service revenue increase was driven by higher average revenue per fixed broadband subscriber in the United States when compared to the same period last fiscal year, reflecting a higher mix of new and existing subscribers choosing Viasat’s premium highest speed plans. Total subscribers at December 31, 2019 were approximately 586,000 compared to 584,000 subscribers at December 31, 2018. The in-flight service revenue increase was driven primarily by the increase in the number of commercial aircraft receiving our in-flight services through our IFC systems, with 1,379 commercial aircraft in service utilizing our IFC systems as of December 31, 2019, compared to 1,123 commercial aircraft in service as of December 31, 2018.
Segment operating profit (loss)
 


 
The change in our satellite services segment operating loss to an operating profit was driven primarily by higher earnings contributions of $90.9 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues and improved margins from our fixed broadband services and in-flight internet services as services scaled efficiently, partially offset by higher support costs and our investments in global broadband businesses.
Commercial networks segment
Revenues 
 


 
Our commercial networks segment revenues decreased by $84.8 million, primarily due to a $92.5 million decrease in product revenues partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in service revenues. The decrease in product revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $117.5 million in mobile broadband satellite communication systems products as IFC terminal deliveries returned to more normalized levels, following accelerated deliveries in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase of $10.8 million in satellite networking development program products. The increase in service revenues was primarily due to an increase of $9.7 million in mobile broadband satellite communication systems services, partially offset by a decrease of $3.1 million in fixed satellite network services.
Segment operating loss
 


 
49

 
The $26.1 million increase in our commercial networks segment operating loss was driven primarily by a $10.3 million increase in SG&A costs, an increase of $9.4 million in IR&D expenses (primarily related to next-generation satellite payload technologies and mobile broadband satellite communications systems), and lower earnings contributions of $6.4 million (primarily due to a decrease in revenues of our mobile broadband satellite communication systems products). 
Government systems segment
Revenues 
 


 
Our government systems segment revenues increased by $171.2 million due to increases of $165.6 million in product revenues and $5.6 million in service revenues. The product revenue increase was due to a $55.3 million increase in tactical satcom radio products, a $44.1 million increase in government satellite communication systems products, a $41.5 million increase in tactical data link products and a $31.1 million increase in government mobile broadband products, partially offset by a decrease of $6.6 million in cybersecurity and information assurance products. The service revenue increase was primarily due to a $5.6 million increase in government mobile broadband services.
Segment operating profit
 


 
The $47.4 million increase in our government systems segment operating profit was primarily due to higher earnings contributions of $63.0 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues from our tactical satcom radio products, government satellite communication systems products and tactical data link products, and improved margins from our tactical satcom radio products and cybersecurity and information assurance products. This increase was partially offset by higher SG&A costs of $18.2 million. 
Backlog
As reflected in the table below, our overall firm and funded backlog increased during the first nine months of fiscal year 2020. The increases in both firm and funded backlog were primarily attributable to increases in our commercial networks systems and satellite services segments. 
 


The firm backlog does not include contract options. Of the $1.9 billion in firm backlog, a little over half is expected to be delivered during the next twelve months, with the balance delivered thereafter. We include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders, and not anticipated purchase orders and requests. In our satellite services segment, our backlog includes fixed broadband service revenues under our subscriber agreements, but does not 
50

 
include future recurring in-flight internet service revenues under our agreements with commercial airlines. As of December 31, 2019, we provided in-flight internet services to 1,379 commercial aircraft, with in-flight internet services anticipated to be activated on over 690 additional commercial aircraft under our existing customer agreements with commercial airlines. There can be no assurance that all anticipated purchase orders and requests will be placed or that anticipated in-flight internet services will be activated. 
Our total new awards exclude future revenue under recurring consumer commitment arrangements and were approximately $577.4 million and $1,775.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and approximately $448.6 million and $1,756.9 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. 
Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. A majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer. Orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery, and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties. In addition, purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development. A failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract. 
Firm backlog amounts are comprised of funded and unfunded components. Funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts. Unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods. Our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long-term contracts on a periodic basis. Our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts. Although we do not control the funding of our contracts, our experience indicates that actual contract funding has ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Overview 
We have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations, bank line of credit financing, debt financing, export credit agency financing and equity financing. At December 31, 2019, we had $47.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $211.8 million in working capital, $110.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) and borrowing availability of $562.4 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2019, we had $261.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $401.7 million in working capital, and no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $680.4 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short-term, highly liquid bank money market accounts. 
Our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including the timing and amount of cash required for our satellite projects and any future broadband satellite projects we may engage in, expansion of our R&D and marketing efforts, and the nature and timing of orders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in complementary businesses, products and technologies which may require the use of cash or additional financing. 
The general cash needs of our satellite services, commercial networks and government systems segments can vary significantly. The cash needs of our satellite services segment tend to be driven by the timing and amount of capital expenditures (e.g., payments under satellite construction and launch contracts and investments in ground infrastructure roll-out), investments in joint ventures, strategic partnering arrangements and network expansion activities, as well as the quality of customer, type of contract and payment terms. In our commercial networks segment, cash needs tend to be driven primarily by the type and mix of contracts in backlog, the nature and quality of customers, the timing and amount of investments in IR&D activities (including with respect to next-generation satellite payload technologies) and the payment terms of customers (including whether advance payments are made or customer financing is required). In our government systems segment, the primary factors determining cash needs tend to be the type and mix of contracts in backlog (e.g., product or service, development or production) and timing of payments (including restrictions on the timing of cash payments under U.S. government procurement regulations). Other factors affecting the cash needs of our commercial networks and government systems segments include contract duration and program performance. For example, if a program is performing well and meeting its contractual requirements, then its cash flow requirements are usually lower. 
To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance the construction and launch of any future satellites, acquisitions, strategic partnering arrangements, joint ventures or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets. In February 2019, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC for the future sale of an unlimited amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants and rights. The securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by us, by selling security holders, or through 
51

 
underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities along with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
Cash flows 
Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 was $293.4 million compared to $214.7 million in the prior year period. This $78.7 million increase was primarily driven by our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges) which resulted in $117.0 million of higher cash provided by operating activities year-over-year, partially offset by a $38.3 million year-over-year increase in cash used to fund net operating assets. The increase in cash used to fund net operating assets during the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 when compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher cash payments made in our accrued liabilities due to timing of payments. 
Cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 was $595.6 million compared to $340.4 million in the prior year period. This $255.1 million increase in cash used in investing activities year-over-year reflects an increase of $78.3 million in cash used for satellite construction, as well as $169.9 million in proceeds received from the insurance claims for the ViaSat-2 satellite and $14.0 million of cash proceeds from sales of real property during the prior year period compared to none in the current year period. 
Cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 was $88.5 million compared to $100.6 million for the prior year period. This $12.2 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities year-over-year was primarily related to a decrease of $355.0 million in proceeds from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in payments on borrowings of debt of $323.0 million, primarily due to $140.0 million in payments under our Revolving Credit Facility in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 compared to none in the current year period and a $188.5 million decrease in payments on borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility year-over-year. Cash provided by financing activities for both periods included cash received from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases, offset by cash used for the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement of certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards.
Satellite-related activities 
On June 1, 2017, our second-generation ViaSat-2 satellite was successfully launched into orbit. Following satellite launch, in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 we incurred additional operating costs as we prepared for and launched commercial services on the satellite. These additional operating costs included depreciation, amortization of capitalized software development, earth station connectivity, marketing and advertising costs, logistics, customer care and various support systems, and contributed to an operating loss for our satellite services segment in fiscal year 2019. However, as the services we provide using the new satellite continue to scale, we expect to expand the revenue base for our fixed broadband and in-flight services and gain operating cost efficiencies, which together we expect will yield incremental segment earnings contributions, partially offset by investments associated with our global business and emerging markets growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in significantly increasing revenues or achieving operating profit in our satellite services segment. Moreover, we anticipate that we will incur a similar cycle of increased operating costs as we prepare for and launch commercial services on future satellites, including our ViaSat-3 constellation, followed by increases in revenue base and in scale.
Our first two ViaSat-3 class satellites, which are expected to cover the Americas and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, respectively, entered the phase of full construction during the second half of fiscal year 2018. In July 2019, we entered into an agreement with Boeing for the construction and purchase of a third ViaSat-3 class satellite and the integration of Viasat’s payload technologies into the satellite. This satellite is expected to provide broadband services over the Asia and Pacific (APAC) region, enabling us, following the launch of commercial service on all three ViaSat-3 class satellites, to deliver affordable connectivity worldwide. We are targeting to launch the first ViaSat-3 class satellite in mid calendar 2021, although the actual launch date will be dependent on the completion of deliverables by our contract manufacturers, subcontractors, and other third party service providers, available launch windows, and other variables. We believe we have adequate sources of funding for the ViaSat-3 class satellites, which include our cash on hand, borrowing capacity and the cash we expect to generate from operations over the next few years. Our total cash funding may be reduced through various third-party agreements, including potential joint service offerings and other strategic partnering arrangements. 
Our IR&D investments are expected to continue through fiscal year 2020 and beyond relating to ViaSat-3 ground infrastructure and support of our growing government and commercial air mobility businesses. We expect to continue to invest in IR&D at a significant level as we continue our focus on leadership and innovation in satellite and space technologies. However, the level of investment in a given fiscal year will depend on a variety of factors, including the stage of development of our satellite projects, new market opportunities and our overall operating performance. In fiscal year 
52

 
2020, capital expenditures are expected to increase when compared to fiscal year 2019, as we have a third ViaSat-3 class satellite under construction, as well as increased ground network investments related to international expansion. 
Revolving Credit Facility 
As of December 31, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility provided a $700.0 million revolving line of credit (including up to $150.0 million of letters of credit), with a maturity date of January 18, 2024. As of December 31, 2019, we had $110.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $27.6 million outstanding under standby letters of credit, leaving borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 of $562.4 million.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (1) the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, or the administrative agent’s prime rate as announced from time to time, or (2) the Eurodollar rate, plus, in the case of each of (1) and (2), an applicable margin that is based on our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.28%. The Revolving Credit Facility is required to be guaranteed by certain significant domestic subsidiaries of Viasat (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and secured by substantially all of our assets. As of December 31, 2019, none of our subsidiaries guaranteed the Revolving Credit Facility. 
The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants regarding a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, make investments and acquisitions, make capital expenditures, grant liens, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments. 
Ex-Im Credit Facility 
The Ex-Im Credit Facility originally provided a $362.4 million senior secured direct loan facility, which was fully drawn. Of the $362.4 million in principal amount of borrowings made under the Ex-Im Credit Facility, $321.2 million was used to finance up to 85% of the costs of construction, launch and insurance of the ViaSat-2 satellite and related goods and services (including costs incurred on or after September 18, 2012), with the remaining $41.2 million used to finance the total exposure fees incurred under the Ex-Im Credit Facility (which included all previously accrued completion exposure fees). At December 31, 2019, we had $117.9 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.38%, payable semi-annually in arrears. The effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility, which takes into account timing and amount of borrowings and payments, exposure fees, debt issuance costs and other fees, is 4.54%. Borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility are required to be repaid in 16 semi-annual principal installments, which commenced on April 15, 2018, with a maturity date of October 15, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of the Ex-Im Credit Facility, certain insurance proceeds related to the ViaSat-2 satellite must be used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility upon receipt. During the first three months of fiscal year 2020, we received the remaining insurance proceeds of $2.3 million, which were in addition to the $185.7 million of insurance proceeds received during fiscal year 2019 related to the ViaSat-2 satellite, all of which were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility upon receipt. The Ex-Im Credit Facility is guaranteed by Viasat and is secured by first-priority liens on the ViaSat-2 satellite and related assets as well as a pledge of the capital stock of the borrower under the facility. 
The Ex-Im Credit Facility contains financial covenants regarding Viasat’s maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the Ex-Im Credit Facility contains covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, make investments and acquisitions, make capital expenditures, grant liens, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments. 
The borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility are recorded as current portion of long-term debt and as other long-term debt, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The discount of $42.3 million (consisting of the initial $6.0 million pre-exposure fee, $35.3 million of completion exposure fees and other customary fees) and deferred financing cost associated with the issuance of the borrowings under the Ex-Im Credit Facility are amortized to interest expense on an effective interest rate basis over the weighted average term of the Ex-Im Credit Facility and in accordance with the related payment obligations.

Senior Notes 
Senior Secured Notes due 2027
In March 2019, we issued $600.0 million in principal amount of 2027 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2027 Notes were issued at face value and are recorded as long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, in our consolidated financial statements. The 2027 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.625% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments commenced in October 2019. Debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2027 Notes are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2027 Notes, the results of which are not materially different from the effective interest rate basis. 
The 2027 Notes are required to be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, none of our subsidiaries guaranteed the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes are secured, equally and ratably with the Revolving Credit Facility and any future parity lien debt, by liens on substantially all of our assets.
The 2027 Notes are our general senior secured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated debt. The 2027 Notes are effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured debt (including our 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes)) as well as to all of any permitted junior lien debt that may be incurred in the future, in each case to the extent of the value of the assets securing the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes are effectively subordinated to any obligations that are secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the collateral securing the 2027 Notes, are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2027 Notes (including obligations of the borrower under the Ex-Im Credit Facility), and are senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. 
The indenture governing the 2027 Notes limits, among other things, our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to: incur, assume or guarantee additional debt; issue redeemable stock and preferred stock; pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; make loans and investments; grant or incur liens; restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; reduce our satellite insurance; and consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of their assets to, another person. 
Prior to April 15, 2022, we may redeem up to 40% of the 2027 Notes at a redemption price of 105.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, from the net cash proceeds of specified equity offerings. We may also redeem the 2027 Notes prior to April 15, 2022, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable premium and any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. The applicable premium is calculated as the greater of: (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such 2027 Notes and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such date of redemption of (1) the redemption price of such 2027 Notes on April 15, 2022 plus (2) all required interest payments due on such 2027 Notes through April 15, 2022 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the date of redemption), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate (as defined under the indenture governing the 2027 Notes) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the then-outstanding principal amount of such 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time during the 12 months beginning on April 15, 2022 at a redemption price of 102.813%, during the 12 months beginning on April 15, 2023 at a redemption price of 101.406%, and at any time on or after April 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100%, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. 
In the event a change of control triggering event occurs (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes), each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s 2027 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
 
Senior Notes due 2025
In September 2017, we issued $700.0 million in principal amount of the 2025 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2025 Notes were issued at face value and are recorded as long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The 2025 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.625% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments commenced in March 2018. Debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2025 Notes are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2025 Notes, the results of which are not materially different from the effective interest rate basis. 
The 2025 Notes are required to be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, none of our subsidiaries guaranteed the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are our general senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated debt. The 2025 Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to our 
54

 
existing and future secured debt, including under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Ex-Im Credit Facility (collectively, the Credit Facilities) and the 2027 Notes (to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt), are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2025 Notes, and are senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. 
The indenture governing the 2025 Notes limits, among other things, our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to: incur, assume or guarantee additional debt; issue redeemable stock and preferred stock; pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; make loans and investments; grant or incur liens; restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; reduce our satellite insurance; and consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of their assets to, another person. 
Prior to September 15, 2020, we may redeem up to 40% of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price of 105.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, from the net cash proceeds of specified equity offerings. We may also redeem the 2025 Notes prior to September 15, 2020, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable premium and any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. The applicable premium is calculated as the greater of: (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such 2025 Notes and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such date of redemption of (1) the redemption price of such 2025 Notes on September 15, 2020 plus (2) all required interest payments due on such 2025 Notes through September 15, 2020 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the date of redemption), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate (as defined under the indenture governing the 2025 Notes) plus 50 basis points, over (b) the then-outstanding principal amount of such 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time during the 12 months beginning on September 15, 2020 at a redemption price of 102.813%, during the 12 months beginning on September 15, 2021 at a redemption price of 101.406%, and at any time on or after September 15, 2022 at a redemption price of 100%, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. 
In the event a change of control triggering event occurs (as defined in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes), each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s 2025 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). 
Contractual Obligations 
The following table sets forth a summary of our obligations at December 31, 2019: 
 


 
 




(1)

To the extent that the interest rate is variable and ultimate amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility may fluctuate, amounts reflected represent estimated interest payments on our current outstanding balances based on the weighted average effective interest rate at December 31, 2019 until the maturity date in January 2024. 
 
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with subcontractors, contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. We also enter into agreements and purchase commitments with suppliers for the construction, launch, and operation of our satellites. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Consequently, only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable and unconditional commitments. 
55

 
Our condensed consolidated balance sheets included $118.1 million and $120.8 million of “other liabilities” as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively, which primarily consisted of the long-term portion of deferred revenues, the long-term portion of our satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites, our long-term warranty obligations, the long-term portion of deferred rent and deferred income taxes. With the exception of the long-term portion of our satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites (which is included under “Satellite performance incentive obligations”), these remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and/or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain. See Note 11 — Commitments to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019 for additional information regarding satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites. See Note 10 — Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our income taxes and related tax positions and Note 8— Product Warranty to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our product warranties. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2019 as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4) other than as discussed under Contractual Obligations above or disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019. 
Recent Authoritative Guidance 
For information regarding recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Interest Rate Risk 
Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term and long-term obligations, including the Credit Facilities, the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes, and foreign currency forward contracts. We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2019, we had $110.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, $117.9 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our Ex-Im Credit Facility, $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2025 Notes and $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2027 Notes, and we held $5.0 million in short-term investments. Our 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes and borrowings under our Ex-Im Credit Facility bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term obligations. 
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain a significant amount of our cash balance in money market accounts. In general, money market accounts are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates. Our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by low market interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, assuming balances remain constant over a year, changed by 50 basis points, interest income would have increased or decreased by an insignificant amount for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative, interest-bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio, we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material. 
As of December 31, 2019, we had $110.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility is the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that is based on our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was 3.28%. Assuming the outstanding balance remained constant over a year, a 50 basis point increase in the interest rate would increase interest incurred, prior to effects of capitalized interest, by an insignificant amount over a twelve-month period. 
Foreign Exchange Risk 
We generally conduct our business in U.S. dollars. However, as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our investment in Euro Broadband Infrastructure Sàrl during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, which is denominated in Euros, increases our exposure to foreign currency risk. A five percent variance in foreign currencies in which our international business is 
56

 
conducted would change our income (loss) before income taxes by an insignificant amount for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency risk is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, from time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions. 
As of December 31, 2019, we had a number of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding which are intended to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in Euros. The foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of an insignificant amount had an insignificant amount of fair value recorded in accrued and other liabilities as of December 31, 2019. If the foreign currency forward rate on these foreign currency forward contracts had changed by 10%, the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2019 would have changed by an insignificant amount. 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2019. 
During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
PART II — OTHER INFORMATION 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
From time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including government investigations and claims, and other claims and proceedings with respect to intellectual property, breach of contract, labor and employment, tax and other matters. Such matters could result in fines; penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages; or non-monetary relief. A violation of government contract laws and regulations could also result in the termination of our government contracts or debarment from bidding on future government contracts. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular period. For further information on the risks we face from existing and future claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, which factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or future results. The risks described in our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or future results.
