TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying
(a) condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2019, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and (b) unaudited
interim condensed financial statements as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared by the Company
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information,
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain
financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements have been condensed or omitted. However,
in the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary
for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the interim periods presented. Operating
results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any
other interim period, due to variability in customer purchasing patterns and seasonal, operating and other factors. These
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019.
 
In preparation of the Company’s financial
statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
related revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision,
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
Effective October 1, 2019 we adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases, using the
effective date method under the modified retrospective approach. The amended guidance requires lessees, at the commencement date,
to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis, and to record a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the
use of, a specified asset for the lease term. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases, Targeted Improvements,
which gave companies the option of applying the new standard at the adoption date, rather than retrospectively to the earliest
period presented in the financial statements. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new standard,
which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company also elected the
practical expedient to not recognize a lease liability and ROU asset for short-term leases less than 12 months. We chose the option
to apply the new standard at the adoption date, and therefore we are not required to restate the financial statements for prior
periods, nor are we required to provide the disclosures required by the new standard for prior periods. Upon adoption, we
recognized an approximate $2.4 million right-of-use asset, and an approximate $2.6 million lease liability. Our adoption of
the new standard did not impact our cash flows or have a material impact on our results of operations. We have expanded our financial
statement disclosures to comply with the requirements of the new standard.
 
Note 2. Net Income Per Share
 
Basic net income per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted EPS equals net income divided by the sum of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus all additional common stock equivalents, such as stock options, when
dilutive.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerator
and denominator of the net income per common share computations for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
 


 
Note 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments
 
The Company currently invests its excess cash
in bank certificates of deposit (“CDs”) that are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
and Unites States Treasury (“Treasuries”) securities with terms of not more than five years, as well as money market
accounts. CDs and Treasuries with original maturities of more than three months are reported as held-to-maturity investments and
are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the negligible risk of changes in value due to interest rates.
The maturity dates of the Company’s investments as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019
are as follows:
 

 
Note 4. Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company recorded $240,586 of compensation
expense related to current and past restricted stock grants, non-qualified stock options and the Company’s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) for the three months ended December 31, 2019 of which $235,788 is included in selling, general
and administrative expense, and $4,798 is included in cost of sales. The Company recorded $538,524 of compensation expense related
to current and past restricted stock grants, non-qualified stock options and the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
for the three months ended December 31, 2018 of which $507,284 is included in selling, general and administrative expense, and
$31,240 is included in cost of sales. As of December 31, 2019, $2,650,700 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to
non-vested restricted stock awards and stock options is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 4.7 years.   
 
Stock Options
 
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing
model to determine the fair value of options granted. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted employees
non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 116,600 shares of common stock with a weighted average contractual term
of 5.78 years, a weighted average 4.78 year vesting term, and an exercise price of $12.43. During the three months ended December
31, 2018, the Company granted employees non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 172,000 shares of common stock
with a weighted average contractual term of four years, a three year vesting term, and a weighted average exercise price of $12.17.
The weighted average fair value at the grant date for options issued during the three months ended December 31, 2019 was $4.93.

 


9


 
This fair value was estimated as of the grant
date using the range of assumptions listed below:
 

 
The expected stock price volatility is based
on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected life represents
the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding after their grant date. The risk-free interest rate reflects the
interest rate as of the grant date on zero-coupon U.S. governmental bonds having a remaining life similar to the expected option
term.
 
Options are granted at fair market values determined
on the date of grant and vesting normally occurs over a three to five-year period. Shares issued upon exercise of a stock option
are issued from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares.
 
The following is a summary of stock option activity
during the three months ended December 31, 2019:
 

 

The intrinsic value of an option is the amount
by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds its exercise price. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining
contractual term for all outstanding and exercisable stock options was 2.40 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $362,123.
During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company received proceeds of $2,580 from the exercise of stock options. During
the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds of $17 from the exercise of stock options.
 
Restricted Stock
 
The Company’s 2007 Stock Compensation
Plan permits its Compensation Committee to grant stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock, to key employees
and non-employee directors. The Company has made restricted stock grants that vest over one to ten years.
 


There were no restricted stock awards granted during the three
months ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted 8,625 performance
stock units which entitles the participant to receive the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock, upon achievement
of a fiscal year 2020 performance goal. The shares issued to the participant in settlement of the performance stock unit, if any,
will be restricted stock subject to forfeiture that will vest one year following the settlement date of the performance stock
unit. The Company has determined the fair value per underlying share of the performance stock unit awards to be $11.86 as of the
grant date. The Company believes it is probable that these performance stock unit awards will vest.

 
Restricted stock transactions during the three
months ended December 31, 2019 are summarized as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
Clearfield, Inc.’s ESPP allows participating
employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP is available
to all employees subject to certain eligibility requirements. Terms of the ESPP provide that participating employees may purchase
the Company’s common stock on a voluntary after-tax basis. Employees may purchase the Company’s common stock at a price
that is no less than the lower of 85% of the fair market value of one share of common stock at the beginning or end of each stock
purchase period or phase. The ESPP is carried out in six month phases, with phases beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar
year. For the phases that ended on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, employees purchased 15,107 and 17,312 shares at a price
of $11.23 and $8.43 per share, respectively. After the employee purchase on December 31, 2019, 34,739 shares of common stock were
available for future purchase under the ESPP.
 
Note 5. Revenue
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Net sales include products and shipping and
handling charges. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products.
All revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by transferring
the promised products to the customer, with substantially all revenue recognized at the point in time the customer obtains control
of the products. We recognize revenue for shipping and handling charges at the time the products are delivered to or picked up
by the customer. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation and are short term in nature. Sales taxes and
value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted
for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales.
 
Disaggregation of Revenue
 
The Company allocates sales from external customers
to geographic areas based on the location to which the product is transported. Sales outside the United States are principally
to countries in the Caribbean, Canada, Central and South America.
 
Our revenues related to the following geographic
areas were as follows for the three months ended:
 

 
Clearfield manufactures and sells a proprietary
product line designed for the Broadband Service Provider marketplace. In addition, the Company provides Build-to-Print services
for original equipment manufacturers requiring copper and fiber cable assemblies built to their specification.
 


11


 
The percentages of our sales by markets were
as follows for the three months ended:
 

 
Broadband Service Providers are made up of Community
Broadband, which includes local and regional telecom companies, utilities, municipalities and alternative carriers, also referred
to as Tier 2 and 3 customers, National Carriers, which includes large national and global wireline and
wireless providers also referred to as Tier 1’s, MSO’s, which include cable tv companies, and International
customers.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Credit is extended based on the evaluation of
a customer’s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the
contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible; payments
subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of both December 31, 2019 and
September 30, 2019, the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts was $289,085.
 
See Note 7, “Major Customer Concentration”
for further information regarding accounts receivable and net sales.
 
Note 6. Inventories
 
Inventories consist of the following as of:
 

 
Note 7. Major Customer Concentration
 

For the three months ended December 31, 2019,
three customers comprised 18%, 13%, and 10%, respectively, or 41% in the aggregate of the Company’s net sales. All three
of these customers were distributors. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, two customers comprised 18%, and 14%, respectively,
or 32% in the aggregate of the Company’s net sales. These customers are both distributors. These major customers, like our
other customers, purchase our products from time to time through purchase orders, and we do not have any agreements that obligate
these major customers to purchase products in the future from us.
 
As of December 31, 2019, two customers accounted for 14%, and 11%, respectively, or 25%
in the aggregate, of accounts receivable. Both of these customers are distributors. As of September 30, 2019, two customers accounted
for 16%, and 12%, respectively, or 28% in the aggregate of accounts receivable. Both of these customers are distributors.

 
Note 8. Goodwill and Intangibles
 
The Company analyzes its goodwill for impairment
annually or at an interim period when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. The result of the
analysis performed as of September 30, 2019 did not indicate an impairment of goodwill. During the three months ended December
31, 2019, there were no triggering events that indicate potential impairment exists.
 
The Company capitalizes legal costs incurred
to obtain patents. Once accepted by either the U.S. Patent Office or the equivalent office of a foreign country, these legal costs
are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated lives, not exceeding 20 years. As of December 31, 2019,
the Company has 21 patents granted and multiple pending applications both inside and outside the United States.
 


12


 
In addition, the Company has various finite
lived intangible assets, most of which were acquired as a result of the acquisition of the active cabinet product line from Calix,
Inc. (“Calix”) during fiscal year 2018. The Company analyzes its intangible assets for impairment annually or at interim
periods when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. The result of the analysis performed as of
September 30, 2019 did not indicate an impairment of our intangible assets. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, there
were no triggering events that indicate potential impairment exists.
 
Note 9. Income Taxes

 
For the three months ended December 31, 2019,
the Company recorded income tax expense of $123,000, reflecting an effective tax rate of 19.7%. For the three months ended December
31, 2018, the Company recorded an expense for income taxes of $296,000, reflecting an effective tax rate of 22.7%. Our first quarter
of fiscal 2020 tax expense reflected a lower tax rate due to increased permanent differences related to research and development
credits. The differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate were related to nondeductible meals and entertainment,
nondeductible stock compensation, foreign derived intangibles deduction and research and development credits.
 
Deferred taxes recognize the impact of temporary
differences between the amounts of the assets and liabilities recorded for financial statement purposes and these amounts measured
in accordance with tax laws. The Company’s realization of deferred tax temporary differences is contingent upon future taxable
earnings. The Company reviewed its deferred tax asset for expected utilization using a “more likely than not” criteria
by assessing the available positive and negative factors surrounding its recoverability.
 
As of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019,
the Company had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $47,000 related to state net operating loss carry forwards the
Company does not expect to utilize. Based on the Company’s analysis and review of long-term forecasts and all available evidence,
the Company determined that there should be no further change in the valuation allowance for the three months ended December 31,
2019.
 
As of December 31,
2019, we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits. It is the Company’s practice to recognize interest and penalties accrued
on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company does not expect any material changes
in its unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
 
Note 10. Leases
 

Clearfield leases a 71,000 square foot facility
at 7050 Winnetka Avenue North, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota consisting of our corporate offices, manufacturing and warehouse space.
The lease term is ten years and two months and commenced on January 1, 2015.  On June 30, 2019, the Company amended its lease
to add 14,000 square feet to this facility, with the lease term for the additional space coterminous with the original lease. Upon
proper notice and payment of a termination fee of approximately $249,000, the Company has a one-time option to terminate the lease
effective as of the last day of the eighth year of the term after the Company commenced paying base rent. The renewal and termination
options have not been included within the lease term because it is not reasonably certain that we will exercise either option.

 
We also have an indirect lease arrangement for
a 46,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. The lease term is three years and commenced on August 1, 2017.
This lease does not contain a written option to renew.
 
Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities
are recognized as of the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term which
includes renewal periods we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees
or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2019, we do not have material lease commitments that have not commenced.
 

For the three months ended December 31, 2019,
operating lease expense included within cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense was $185,628 and $56,366,
respectively.

 


13



 
Maturities of lease liabilities were as follows as of December 31, 2019:
 

 
The weighted average term and weighted average
discount rate for our leases as of December 31, 2019 were 4.94 years and 3.51%, respectively. For the three months ended December
31, 2019, the operating cash outflows from our leases was $167,840.
 

Rent expense for our operating leases the three
months ended December 31, 2018 as accounted under ASC 840, included within cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative
expense was $168,828 and $53,538, respectively.
 
As previously disclosed in Note B of
the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842), the future minimum payments required under lease agreements were as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 
The statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s
expected future business and financial performance. Words such as  “plan,” “expect,” “aim,”
“believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”
“will,” “should,” “could” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify
these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events
and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking
statements because of the factors identified in and incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, as well as in other filings we make with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which should be considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” All forward-looking statements included herein are made as
the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update
the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 
 
The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 1 of this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended September 30, 2019.
 
OVERVIEW
 
General
 
Clearfield, Inc. designs, manufactures and distributes
fiber optic management, protection and delivery products for communications networks. Our “fiber to the anywhere” platform
serves the unique requirements of leading Broadband Service Providers in the United States, which include Community Broadband,
National Carriers, and MSO’s, while also serving the broadband needs of the International markets, primarily countries in
the Caribbean, Canada, and Central and South America. These customers are collectively included in Broadband Service Providers.
The Company also provides contract manufacturing services for Build-to-Print customers which include original equipment manufacturers
(OEM) requiring copper and fiber cable assemblies built to their specifications.  
 

The Company has historically focused on the
un-served or under-served rural communities who receive their voice, video and data services from independent telephone companies.
By aligning its in-house engineering and technical knowledge alongside its customers, the Company has been able to develop, customize
and enhance products from design through production. Final build and assembly of the Company’s products is completed at Clearfield’s
plants in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and Mexico, with manufacturing support from a network of domestic and global manufacturing
partners. Clearfield specializes in producing these products on both a quick-turn and scheduled delivery basis. The Company deploys
a hybrid sales model with some sales made directly to the customer, some made through two-tier distribution (channel) partners,
sales agents and manufacturing representatives, and sales through original equipment suppliers who private label their products.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Three months ended December 31, 2019 vS. three
months ended December 31, 2018
 
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020
ended December 31, 2019 were $19,377,000, a decrease of approximately 4% or $711,000, from net sales of $20,089,000 for the first
quarter of fiscal 2019. Net sales to Broadband Service Providers were $18,155,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $18,800,000
in the same period of fiscal 2019. Among this group, the Company recorded $1,137,000 in international sales for the first quarter
of fiscal 2020 versus $1,585,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019. Net sales to build-to-print customers were $1,223,000 in the
first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $1,289,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019. The Company allocates sales from external customers
to geographic areas based on the location to which the product is transported. Accordingly, international sales represented 6%
and 8% of total net sales for the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
The decrease in net sales for the quarter ended
December 31, 2019 of $711,000 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was due to reductions in both Community Broadband
and International markets totaling $1,865,000, primarily attributable to lower sales of the Company’s active cabinet product
line. Offsetting this were increased sales of Tier 1 customers of $772,000, and MSO’s of $425,000. Additionally, sales to
build-to-print customers decreased $67,000, relatively unchanged from the prior period. Revenue from all customers is obtained
from purchase orders submitted from time to time. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to predict orders in future periods
or trends affecting orders in future periods is limited.

 
Cost of sales for
the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $11,650,000, a decrease of $492,000, or 4%, from $12,142,000 in the comparable period of fiscal
2019. Gross profit percent was 39.9% in the fiscal 2020 first quarter, up from 39.6% for the fiscal 2019 first quarter. Gross profit
decreased $219,000, or 3%, to $7,728,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 from $7,947,000 in the comparable period in fiscal
2019. The decrease in gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was due to decreased volume while the increase in
gross profit percent was primarily due to product mix.
 


15


 



Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $550,000, or 8%, to $7,326,000 in the fiscal 2020 first quarter from $6,776,000 for the fiscal 2019 first quarter. The
increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 consists primarily of an increase
of $594,000 in compensation costs due primarily to additional sales and engineering personnel and an increase of $160,000 of external
sales commissions and agent fees. These were somewhat offset by a decrease of $271,000 in stock compensation expense in the quarter.
 
Income from operations for the quarter ended
December 31, 2019 was $402,000 compared to income from operations of $1,171,000 for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2019, a decrease
of approximately 66%. This decrease is primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Interest income for
the quarter ended December 31, 2019 was $223,000 compared to $135,000 for the comparable quarter for fiscal 2019. The increase
is due to higher investment balances and interest rates earned on its investments in fiscal 2020. The Company invests its excess
cash primarily in FDIC-backed bank certificates of deposit, US Treasury securities and money market accounts.
 


We recorded a provision for income taxes of
$123,000 and $296,000 for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We record our quarterly provision for income
taxes based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for the year. The decrease in tax expense of $173,000 from the first quarter
for fiscal 2019 is primarily due decreased taxable income during the first quarter for fiscal 2020, as well as a lower effective
tax rate. The decrease in the income tax expense rate to 19.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 from 22.7% for the first quarter
of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to increased research and development costs.
 
The Company’s net income for
the quarter ended December 31, 2019 was $501,000, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. The Company’s net income for
the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was $1,010,000, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of December 31, 2019, our principal source
of liquidity was our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Those sources total $25,110,000 as of December 31, 2019
compared to $23,606,000 as of September 30, 2019. Our excess cash is invested mainly in certificates of deposit backed by the FDIC,
US Treasury securities and money market accounts. Substantially all of our funds are insured by the FDIC or backed by the United
States Government. Investments considered long-term were $21,704,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $23,902,000 as of September
30, 2019. We believe the combined balances of short-term cash and investments along with long-term investments provide a more accurate
indication of our available liquidity. We had no long-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2019 or September 30, 2019.
 
We believe our existing cash equivalents and
short-term investments, along with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and investment requirements
for beyond the next 12 months. The Company intends on utilizing its available
cash and assets primarily for its continued organic growth and potential future strategic transactions, as well as execution of
the share repurchase program adopted by our Board of Directors. The share repurchase program was originally adopted on November
13, 2014 with $8,000,000 authorized for common stock repurchases. On April 25, 2017, our Board of Directors increased the authorization
to $12,000,000 of common stock.
 
Operating Activities
 

Net cash used in operating activities totaled
$100,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to net income of $501,000, non-cash expenses for
depreciation and amortization of $607,000, and stock based compensation of $241,000 in addition to changes in operating assets
and liabilities providing cash. Changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash include increases in inventory of $1,617,000,
decreases in accounts payable of $1,816,000, offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $2,093,000. Accounts receivable balances
can be influenced by the timing of shipments for customer projects and payment terms. Day’s sales outstanding, which measures
how quickly receivables are collected, decreased two days to 33 days from September 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The increase
in inventory represents an adjustment for seasonal demand along with changes in stocking levels. Changes in working capital reflects
items using cash, including a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,848,000 which primarily reflects fiscal
2019 accrued bonus compensation accruals and accounts payable paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

and liabilities providing cash. Changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash include decreases in accounts receivable

are collected, decreased 15 days to 37 days from September 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The decrease in inventory represents
an adjustment for seasonal demand along with changes in stocking levels. Changes in working capital items using cash include a
decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent of $432,000 which primarily reflects fiscal 2018 accrued bonus
compensation accruals paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
 


Management utilizes its technical knowledge,
cumulative business experience, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of the Company’s accounting policies.
