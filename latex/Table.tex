Table 1 Panel C and Table 1 Panel D present correlation matrix for key variables in 10-Q and 8-K sample. Pearson (Spearman) correlations are exhibited in right-top (left-bottom) matrix. See \hyperref[appb]{Appendix B} and \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C} for textual and financial variable definitions. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level.

Table 2 Panel A presents regression results of Equation (1). TEX represents a vector of textual properties that consists of number of words (NW), tone (TONE) and reporting time lag (TLAG). \textit{Controls} denotes a vector of control variables including firm size (SIZE), market-to-book ratio (MTB) and leverage ratio (LEV). See \hyperref[appb]{Appendix B} and \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C} for textual and financial variable definitions. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level. Column 2, 4 and 6 include firm and time fixed effects and standard errors are clustered at industry level identified by 4-digit SIC codes. ***, ** and * indicate significance at the 1\%, 5\% and 10\% levels in a two-tailed test.

Table 3 Panel B presents regression results of Equation (3) with TEX being NITEM (Column 1), N8K (Column 2) and TLAG (Column 3), respectively. \textit{Controls} denotes a vector of control variables including firm size (SIZE), market-to-book ratio (MTB) and leverage ratio (LEV). Column 1 presents results of an ordinary least square (OLS) regression with firm and time fixed effects and clustered standard errors at industry level identified by 4-digit SIC codes.
