Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation:  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements and footnotes thereto are unaudited. 
In the opinion of the management of the International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), these statements include all adjustments, which are
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs,
expenses and gains and losses not affecting retained earnings that are reported
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.  Actual results may be different.  See the companys 2007 Annual Report for a
discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  The information included in this Form 10-Q
should be read in conjunction with the companys 2007 Annual Report.
 
Within
the financial tables in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not
add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages
presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
 
2. Accounting
Changes:  In June 2008, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task
Force 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities, which will become effective in 2009
via retrospective application. Under the FSP, unvested share-based payment
awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings
per share (EPS) pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method
determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating
securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective
participation rights in undistributed earnings. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
granted to employees prior to December 31, 2007 are considered
participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalents
at the same rate as common stock. RSUs granted after December 31, 2007 do
not receive dividend equivalents and are not considered participating
securities. The company will adopt the FSP in fiscal year 2009. Upon
implementation, the company does not expect a material impact on diluted and
basic EPS. The implementation of the FSP is expected to decrease diluted EPS by
$0.01 for the first and second quarters of 2008, by $0.02 for the six months
ended June 30, 2008, and by $0.03 for the year ended December 31,
2007. Basic EPS is expected to decrease by $0.01 in each of the first and
second quarters of 2008, by $0.02 for the six months ended June 30, 2008
and by $0.05 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
In March 2008, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 expands the current disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, such that entities must now provide
enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses
derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under
SFAS No. 133 and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the
entitys financial position, performance and cash flow. Pursuant to the
transition provisions of the Statement, the company will adopt SFAS No. 161
in fiscal year 2009 and will present the required disclosures in the prescribed
format on a prospective basis. This Statement will not impact the consolidated
financial results as it is disclosure-only in nature.
 
In February 2008, the
FASB issued FSP Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 157-1, Application of FASB
Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting
Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
Classification or Measurement under Statement 13, and FSP FAS 157-2, Effective
Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP FAS 157-1 removes leasing from the
scope of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FSP FAS 157-2 delays the
effective date of SFAS No. 157 from 2008 to 2009 for all nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at
least annually). See SFAS No. 157 discussion on page 9.
 
In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which will become
effective in 2009 via prospective application to business combinations. This
Statement requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to a
broader set of business combinations, amends the definition of a business
combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an acquirer to
recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date and
requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be
measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date (with
limited exceptions). The company will adopt this Statement in fiscal year 2009
and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of
business combinations subject to this statement.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement
requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be
accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the
treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest
and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional
disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the
controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 160, the company will adopt the Statement in fiscal year 2009 via
retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure requirements. The
company does not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material
effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,
which became effective January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities
to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally
accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is
irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings.
The company adopted this Statement as of January 1, 2008 and the adoption
of this Statement did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
In September 2006, the
FASB finalized SFAS No. 157 which became effective January 1, 2008
except as amended by FSP FAS 157-1 and FSP FAS 157-2 as previously described.
This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements; however, it does not
require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157
were applied prospectively to fair value measurements and disclosures for
financial assets and financial liabilities and nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on at least an annual basis beginning in the first quarter of 2008.
The adoption of this Statement did not have a material effect on the
Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value measurements made during the
six months ended June 30, 2008. While the company does not expect the
adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on its Consolidated
Financial Statements in subsequent reporting periods, the company continues to
monitor any additional implementation guidance that is issued that addresses
the fair value measurements for certain financial assets, such as private
market pension plan assets, and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities not disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least
an annual basis. See Note 6 on pages 12 to 14 for additional information
regarding the adoption of this Statement.

The reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three
months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in the
prior year, was principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock
option grants ($55 million), partially offset by an increase related to
restricted and performance-based stock units ($36 million).  The reduction in pre-tax stock-based
compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to
the corresponding period in the prior year, was principally the result of a
reduction in the level of stock option grants ($119 million), partially offset
by an increase related to restricted and performance-based stock units ($93
million). The effects on pre-tax stock-based compensation cost related to the
formation of a joint venture based on the companys Printing Systems Division
are included in Other (income) and expense above and in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
2007.
 
As of June 30, 2008, the total unrecognized
compensation cost of $1,342 million related to non-vested awards is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.
 
There were no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at June 30, 2008
and 2007.
 
For
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awarded after December 31, 2007, dividend
equivalents will not be paid. The fair value of such RSUs is determined and
fixed on the grant date based on the companys stock price adjusted for the
exclusion of dividend equivalents.
 
5. Retirement-Related
Benefits: The company offers defined benefit
pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, as well as nonpension
postretirement plans primarily consisting of retiree medical benefits.  The following tables provide the total
retirement-related benefit plans impact on income from continuing operations
before income taxes.

In
2008, the company expects to contribute to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans
approximately $660 million, which is the legally mandated minimum contribution
for its non-U.S. plans. Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first
half of 2008 were $295 million.
 
On April 29, 2008, the IBM Board of Directors
approved a pension adjustment for certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries.
Effective September 1, 2008, this adjustment provides a pension increase
to approximately 42,000 IBM retirees who retired before January 1, 1997. The impact of this adjustment will be
included in the IBM Personal Pension Plan remeasurement at December 31,
2008, therefore, there will be no impact to 2008 net periodic pension cost.

The company received a $17.1
million subsidy in the second quarter and $20.2 million for the first half of
2008 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by the company to
reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the remainder is
contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the participants.
For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 115
in the companys 2007 Annual Report.
 
6. Fair
Value:  As highlighted in Note 2 on page 8, the
company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157-1
and FSP FAS 157-2 on January 1, 2008. Pursuant to the provisions of FSP
FAS 157-2, the company will not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157 until
January 1, 2009 for the following major categories of nonfinancial assets
and liabilities from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: Plant,
rental machines and other property-net; Goodwill; Intangible assets-net; and,
the Asset retirement obligation liabilities within Other accrued expenses and
liabilities and Other liabilities.  The
company recorded no change to its opening balance of Retained earnings as of January 1,
2008 as it did not have any financial instruments requiring retrospective
application per the provisions of SFAS No. 157.
 
Fair
Value Hierarchy
 
SFAS No. 157 specifies
a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those
valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use
based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) or
reflect the companys own assumptions of market participant valuation
(unobservable inputs). In accordance with SFAS No. 157, these two types of
inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
 



· Level 1 


Quoted prices in active
  markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for
  identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;




· Level 2 


Quoted prices for
  identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted
  prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial
  instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or
  indirectly;




· Level 3 


Prices or valuations that
  require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
  unobservable.



 
12





Table
of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
SFAS No. 157 requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
Measurement
of Fair Value
 
The company measures fair
value as an exit price using the procedures described below for all assets and
liabilities measured at fair value. When available, the company uses unadjusted
quoted market prices to measure fair value and classifies such items within
Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon
internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based or
independently-sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency
rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according
to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be inputs that
are readily observable. If quoted market prices are not available, the
valuation model used generally depends on the specific asset or liability being
valued. The determination of fair value considers various factors including
interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments.
For derivatives and marketable debt securities, the company uses a discounted
cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the
instrument. In the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a nonpublic
equity method investment, the company uses the net asset value of its
investment in the investee adjusted using discounted cash flows for the companys
estimate of the price that it would receive to sell the investment to a market
participant that would consider all factors that would impact the investments
fair value. In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company
considers base valuations calculated using the methodologies described  below for several parameters that market
participants would consider in determining fair value.
 
- Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, where the base valuation uses
market parameters based on an AA (or equivalent) credit rating. Due to the fact
that not all counterparties have a AA (or equivalent) credit rating, it is
necessary to take into account the actual credit rating of a counterparty to
determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
 
- Credit risk adjustments
are applied to reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all
liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates
the companys own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
The following table presents
the companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis at June 30, 2008 consistent with the fair value hierarchy
provisions of SFAS No. 157.

Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
 
Certain assets are measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the
table above. These assets include equity method investments that are recognized
at fair value at the end of the period to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis and are included in the table above can also be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include public cost method
investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The company
did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges for these assets
during the first six months of 2008.
 
7. Accelerated Share
Repurchase:  In May 2007, IBM International Group
(IIG), a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the company repurchased 118.8
million shares of common stock for $12.5 billion under accelerated share
repurchase (ASR) agreements with three banks.
 
Pursuant to the ASR
agreements, executed on May 25, 2007, IIG paid an initial purchase
price of $105.18 per share for the repurchase. The initial purchase price was
subject to adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of IBM common
stock over a settlement period of three months for each of the banks. The
adjustment also reflected certain other amounts including the banks carrying
costs, compensation for ordinary dividends declared by the company during the settlement
period and interest benefits for receiving the $12.5 billion payment in advance
of the anticipated purchases by each bank of shares in the open market during
its settlement period.  The adjustment
amount could be settled in cash, registered shares or unregistered shares at
IIGs option. Under the ASR, IIG had a separate settlement with each of
the three banks. The first settlement occurred on September 6, 2007,
resulting in a settlement payment to the bank of $151.8 million. The second settlement
occurred on December 5, 2007, resulting in a settlement payment to the
bank of $253.1 million. The third settlement occurred on March 4, 2008,
resulting in a settlement payment to the company of $54.2 million. The
settlement amounts were paid in cash at the election of IIG in accordance with
the provisions of the ASR and were recorded as adjustments to Stockholders
equity in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on the settlement
dates. The adjusted average price paid per share during the ASR period was
$108.13, resulting in a total purchase price of $12,851 million versus the
original $12,500 million. The $351 million difference was settled in cash.
 
8. Acquisitions: During the six months ended June 30,
2008, the company completed 13 acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $6,447
million. The Cognos, Inc. and Telelogic AB acquisitions are shown
separately given their significant purchase prices.
 
Cognos, Inc.
(Cognos)  On January 31, 2008, the company acquired 100 percent of the
outstanding common shares of Cognos for consideration of $5,021 million
consisting of $4,998 million of cash and $24 million of equity instruments.
Through this acquisition, IBM and Cognos will become a leading provider of
technology and services for business intelligence and performance management, delivering
the industrys most complete, open standards-based platform with the broadest
range of expertise to help companies expand the value of their information,
optimize their business processes and maximize performance across their
enterprises. The company acquired Cognos to accelerate its Information on
Demand strategy, a cross-company initiative that combines the companys
strength in information integration, content and data management and business
consulting services to unlock the business value of information. Cognos was
integrated into the Software segment upon acquisition, and goodwill, as
reflected in the table on page 15 has been entirely assigned to the
Software segment. It is expected that 20-30 percent of the goodwill will be
deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted average useful life of the
intangible assets acquired, excluding goodwill, is 6.5 years.
 
Telelogic,
AB (Telelogic)  On April 3, 2008, IBM acquired 100 percent of the
outstanding common shares of Telelogic for cash consideration of $885 million.
Telelogic is a leading global provider of solutions for automating and
supporting best practices across the enterprise 
from powerful modeling of business processes and enterprise architectures
to requirements-driven development of advanced systems and software. Telelogics
solutions enable organizations to align product, systems and software
development lifecycles with business objectives and customer needs to
dramatically improve quality and predictability, while significantly reducing
time-to-market and overall costs. Clients will benefit from the combined
technologies and services of both companies, providing them a wider range of
software and system development capabilities used to build complex systems.
Telelogic was integrated into the Software segment upon acquisition, and
goodwill, as reflected in the table on page 15 has been entirely assigned
to the Software segment. None of the goodwill will be deductible for tax
purposes. The overall weighted average useful life of the intangible assets acquired,
excluding goodwill, is 7.0 years.

Other Acquisitions  The company acquired 11
additional companies at an aggregate cost of $541 million that are presented in
the table below as Other Acquisitions.
 
The Software segment completed seven other
acquisitions, all privately held companies: in the first quarter; AptSoft
Corporation, Solid Information Technology, Net Integration Technologies Inc.,
and Encentuate, Inc; in the second quarter; 
Infodyne, Beijing Super Info and FilesX.
 
Global Technology Services (GTS) completed one
acquisition in the first quarter: Arsenal Digital Solutions, a privately held
company. Arsenal provides global clients with security rich information
protection services designed to handle increasing data retention requirements.
 
Global
Business Services (GBS) completed one acquisition in the first quarter:
u9consult, a privately held company. u9consult complements the companys
existing capabilities in value chain consulting.
 
Systems and Technology completed two acquisitions in
the second quarter: Diligent Technologies Corporation and Platform Solutions,
Inc (PSI), both privately held companies. Diligent will be an important component of IBMs New
Enterprise Data Center model, which helps clients improve IT efficiency and
facilitates the rapid deployment of new IT services for future business growth. PSIs technologies and skills, along with its
intellectual capital, will be integrated into the companys mainframe product
engineering cycles and future product plans. In the second quarter, $24 million
of the purchase price of PSI was attributed to the settlement of a preexisting
lawsuit between IBM and PSI and recorded in SG&A expense. See note 14 on page 18
for additional information regarding this litigation. Also, the company
recorded a $24 million In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) charge
related to this acquisition in the second quarter.
 
Purchase price consideration for the Other
Acquisitions was paid all in cash. All acquisitions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
The table below reflects the
purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price
allocations as of June 30, 2008.

Purchase price allocation at June 30, 2008 reflects immaterial adjustments

The acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions, and
accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded
at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items
that generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. For the Other Acquisitions, the
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 5.0 years. With the exception of goodwill, these identified
intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
lives. Goodwill of $433 million has been assigned to the Software ($119
million), Global Technology Services ($84 million) and Systems and Technology
($231 million) segments. Substantially, all of the goodwill related to Other
Acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes.

9. Printing Systems Divestiture:  In January 2007,
the company announced an agreement with Ricoh Company Limited (Ricoh), a
publicly traded company, to form a joint venture company based on IBMs
Printing System Division (a division of the Systems and Technology segment).
The company initially created a wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoPrint Solutions
Company, LLC (InfoPrint), by contributing specific assets and liabilities from
its printer business. The Printing System Division generated approximately $1
billion of revenue in 2006. The InfoPrint portfolio includes solutions for
production printing for enterprises and commercial printers as well as solutions
for office workgroup environments and industrial segments. On June 1, 2007
(closing date), the company divested 51 percent of its interest in InfoPrint to
Ricoh.  The company will divest its
remaining ownership to Ricoh quarterly over a three year period from the
closing date. At June 30, 2008, the companys ownership in InfoPrint was
32.6 percent. See IBMs 2007 Annual Report, Note C, Acquisitions/Divestitures,
for additional information.

(1) Other intangibles
are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business processes,
methodologies and systems and impacts from currency translation.
 
The
net carrying amount of intangible assets increased $1,170 million during the
first half of 2008, primarily due to acquired intangible assets and capitalized
software additions, partially offset by amortization. The aggregate intangible
amortization expense was $337 million and $654 million for the second quarter
and first six months of 2008, respectively, versus $289 million and $580
million for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2007,
respectively. In addition, in the first half of 2008, the company retired $619
million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying
amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
 
The
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to
intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position is estimated to be the following at June 30, 2008:

Net investment in
sales-type leases is for leases that relate principally to the companys
equipment and are for terms ranging from two to seven years. Net investment in
sales-type leases includes unguaranteed residual values of $947 million and
$915 million at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively,
and is reflected net of unearned income of $1,069 million and $1,016 million
and of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $141 million and $127 million at
those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial
financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts receivable
financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment
terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30
to 90 days.
 
Client loans
receivables relate to loans that are provided by Global Financing primarily to
the companys clients to finance the purchase of the companys software and
services. Separate contractual relationships on these financing arrangements
are for terms ranging from two to seven years. Each financing contract is
priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these separate financing agreements.
 
The company
utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for non-recourse
borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for borrowings were
$341 million and $258 million at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30, 2008 and December 31,
2007.

12. Segments:
The tables on pages 63 and 64 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results
of the companys reportable segments consistent with the management system used
by the companys chief operating decision maker. These results are not necessarily
a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP.
For example, employee retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial
assumptions on a country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments based
on headcount. Different results could occur if actuarial assumptions that are
unique to each segment were used. Segment performance measurement is based on
income before income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in part,
by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources
to, each of the segments.
 
13. Restructuring-Related
Liabilities: The
following table provides a rollforward of the current and noncurrent liability
balances for actions taken in the following periods: (1) the
second-quarter of 2005; (2) the fourth-quarter 2002 actions associated
with the acquisition of the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting business; (3) the
second-quarter of 2002 actions associated with the Microelectronics Division
and the rebalancing of both the companys workforce and leased space resources;
(4) the 2002 actions associated with the hard disk drive (HDD) business
for reductions in workforce, manufacturing capacity and space; (5) actions
taken in 1999; and (6) actions that took place prior to 1994. See the
companys 2007 Annual Report, Note Q on pages 99 and 100 for additional
information on the actions taken in 2005.

14. Contingencies:  The company is involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits,
investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of its business, including actions with respect to contracts,
intellectual property (IP), product liability, employment, benefits,
securities, foreign operations and environmental matters. These actions may be
commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, partners,
clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies,
stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does
business.
 
The
following is a summary of some of the more significant legal matters involving
the company.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and
focus the issues in the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet
issued its decision. On August 10, 2007, the court in another suit, The
SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., issued a decision and order determining,
among other things, that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights,
and obligating SCO to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims against IBM and
Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. At the request of the court in
SCO v. IBM, on August 31, 2007, each of the parties filed a status report
with the court concerning the effect of the August 10th Novell ruling on
the SCO v. IBM case, including the pending motions. On September 14, 2007,
plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case
were stayed.

On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc.
(PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. IBM filed its amended complaint on August 17, 2007 and asserted
claims for patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, copyright
infringement, tortious interference and breach of contract in connection with
PSIs development and marketing of a computer system that PSI says is
compatible with IBMs S/390 and System z architectures. IBM also sought a
declaratory judgment that its refusal to license its patents to PSI and certain
of its software for use on PSI systems does not violate the antitrust laws. IBM
seeks damages and injunctive relief. On September 21, 2007, PSI answered
the amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against IBM for alleged
monopolization and attempted monopolization, tying, violations of New York and
California statutes proscribing unfair competition, tortious interference with
the acquisition of PSI by a third party and promissory estoppel. PSI also
sought declaratory judgments of noninfringement of IBMs patents and patent
invalidity. In October 2007, PSI filed a complaint with the European
Commission claiming that the companys alleged refusal to do business with PSI
violated European competition law. The company responded to this complaint in
December. On January 11, 2008, the court in the New York lawsuit permitted
T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems, to intervene as a
counterclaim-plaintiff, and the court also permitted the company to file a
second amended complaint adding patent infringement claims against T3. On June 30,
2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a result of this transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed
all claims against each other. Litigation between the company and T3 continues.
 
In
October 2003, a purported collective action lawsuit was filed against IBM
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by
10 former IBM employees alleging, on behalf of themselves and allegedly
similarly situated former employees, that the company engaged in a pattern and
practice of discriminating against employees on the basis of age when it
terminated employees, both in connection with reductions in force and
individualized determinations (Syverson v. IBM). Initially, the District Court
dismissed the lawsuit on the basis of release agreements signed by all the
plaintiffs. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial courts finding
that the release barred these claims, and in January 2007, after denial of
IBMs petition for rehearing, the matter was returned to the trial court for
further proceedings. On October 3, 2007, the court dismissed with
prejudice plaintiffs claim for relief under the Older Workers Benefit
Protection Act, and dismissed with leave to amend plaintiffs claim asserting
disparate impact age discrimination with respect to individualized
terminations. On November 6, 2007, plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint, amending the disparate impact claim. IBM filed its answer on November 26,
2007, and discovery is proceeding.
 
In
July 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York related to the companys disclosures
concerning first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity
compensation. Pursuant to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006,
the two lawsuits were consolidated into a single action captioned In re
International Business Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs filed
a corrected consolidated amended complaint dated May 19, 2006, in which
they named the company and IBMs Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer as defendants and alleged that defendants made certain
misrepresentations and omissions in violation of Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
On September 20, 2006, the Court denied a Motion to Dismiss that was filed
by IBM. On March 12, 2007, the plaintiffs class was certified; class
notifications were mailed on or about May 30, 2007. On May 30, 2008,
the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement of this action and set September 8,
2008 as the date for a fairness hearing.
 
In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea
announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several
companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea
and LG Electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005)
and had also charged employees of some of those entities with, among other
things, bribery of certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea
and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in
these matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM
employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM
were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different
times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance,
which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter. In March 2008,
the company received a request from the SEC for additional information.

On
March 27, 2008, the company was temporarily suspended from participating
in new business with U.S. Federal government agencies.  The notice of temporary suspension was issued
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related to an investigation by
the EPA of possible violations of the Procurement Integrity provisions of the
Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act regarding a specific bid for business
with the EPA originally submitted in March 2006. In addition, the U.S.
Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia served the company and
certain employees with grand jury subpoenas related to the bid, requesting
testimony and documents regarding interactions between employees of the EPA and
certain company employees. On April 4, 2008, the company announced an
agreement with the EPA that terminated the temporary suspension order.  The company is cooperating with the EPA and
with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.
 
The
company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought in Tokyo District Court by
Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover losses that it allegedly
suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy)
proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo Leasing amounts for
which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others liable. The claims in this
suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in
Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages
in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.
 
The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the
importation of computer software. The total amounts related to these matters
are approximately $2.6 billion, including amounts currently in litigation and
other amounts. In addition, the company has received an income tax assessment
from Mexican authorities relating to the deductibility of certain warranty
payments. In response, the company has filed an appeal in the Mexican Federal
Fiscal court. The total potential amount related to this matter for all
applicable years is approximately $550 million. The company believes it will
prevail on these matters and that these amounts are not meaningful indicators
of liability.
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5),
the company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are
reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the
impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other
information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30,
2008, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its
experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters
previously referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential
liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters
previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend itself
vigorously in all such matters, it is possible that the companys business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in
any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such
claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material
effect on the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and
amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies;
the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on
the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances
of the particular matter which may give rise to additional factors.
 
15. Commitments:  The
companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused
amounts of $4,944 million and $3,702 million at June 30, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $4,288 million and $3,654
million at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
 
The
company has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee
or indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required
by SFAS No. 5, by requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of
guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is
remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is
the guarantor.
 
The
company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters.
Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by
the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants
related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual
property (IP) rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance
of non-financial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of
these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party
making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract,
which procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other partys
claims. Further, the companys obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It
is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements
have not had a material effect on the    
companys business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In
addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The
maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $24
million and $23 million at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position is not material.
 
The
company offers warranties for its hardware products that range up to three
years, with the majority being either one or three years. Estimated costs for
warranty terms standard to the deliverable are recognized when revenue is
recorded for the related deliverable. Revenue from extended warranty contracts,
for which the company is obligated to perform, is recorded as deferred income
and subsequently recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period.
Changes in the companys deferred income for extended warranty contracts and
warranty liability for standard warranties, which are included in other accrued
expenses and liabilities and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, are presented in the following tables:

*      The following Results of
Continuing Operations discussion does not include the hard disk drive (HDD)
business that the company sold to Hitachi, Ltd. on December 31, 2002. The
HDD business was accounted for as a discontinued operation under generally
accepted accounting principles. There were no losses from Discontinued
Operations in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 and a $1 million
loss in the second quarter of 2007 and no loss for the first six months of
2007. 
 
**   5.6 percent adjusted for currency
 
Within the
Management Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at
constant currency are made so that the financial results can be viewed without
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby
facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the companys business
performance.
 
In the second
quarter, total revenue increased 12.8 percent as reported, 5.6 percent adjusted
for currency, versus the second quarter of 2007. Pre-tax income from continuing
operations was $3,814 million, up 21.4 percent compared to the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.98, an increase of
27.7 percent year to year.
 
The company
has been executing a strategy that aligns investments to growth opportunities.
In the emerging markets, the company continues to invest to capture
opportunities created from the build out of the infrastructures in these
high-growth economies. In the more established markets, the company has been
managing its business for productivity and the company is delivering solutions
that provide value to its clients. In this environment, clients are looking for
ways to save cost, conserve capital and manage risk. The companys second
quarter financial results reflect the strength of the companys unique business
model, built for both emerging and established markets and for delivering
breakthrough technologies and business know-how to its clients.
 
Revenue growth was
consistent across all geographies when adjusted for currency. Americas revenue
increased 8.2 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency), Europe increased 19.9
percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) and Asia Pacific increased 15.8
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency). In the established countries, which
the company manages through its major markets organization, the companys value
proposition and its new technologies drove strong growth. U.S. revenue growth
was 5 percent, and Canada accelerated to an 11 percent growth rate, adjusted
for currency. In Europe, revenue adjusted for currency, increased 7 percent in
Germany, 6 percent in France, while Italy grew 5 percent and the U.K.
increased  4 percent. Japan revenue,
adjusted for currency, decreased year to year, however the revenue growth rate
improved modestly from last quarter.

Management Discussion 
(continued)
 
The company focuses on the
emerging markets through its new growth markets organization. These countries
represented 18 percent of the companys geographic revenue in the quarter and
grew 21 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency). A subset of these
countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, together grew 31 percent (20
percent adjusted for currency). The increase was driven by strong growth in
India, which was up 35 percent (37 percent adjusted for currency).
 
On a segment
basis, the increase in revenue was driven by strong double digit growth
in Global Services. Global Technology Services revenue increased 15.3 percent,
while Global Business Services revenue improved by 17.7 percent versus the
second quarter of 2007.  Software revenue
increased 16.7 percent led by branded middleware, including contributions from
the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions. In addition, Systems and Technology
revenue increased 2.2 percent, primarily driven by the new z10 mainframe,
growth in converged System p servers  and
Storage, partially offset by weaker performance in Microelectronics OEM, legacy
System i, System x and the impact of the prior year printer divestiture. Total
Systems revenue growth was 9.9 percent in the second quarter. Global Financing
revenue increased 6.1 percent reflecting an improvement in financing revenue
offset by a decline in used equipment sales.
 
The gross profit margin was
43.2 percent, an increase of 1.4 points, primarily due to improved margins in
Global Technology Services (0.7 points of the increase), improved revenue mix
in Systems and Technology (0.3 points of the increase), improved margins in
Global Business Services (0.3 points of the increase) and improved revenue mix
in Software (0.3 points of the increase).
 
Total
expense and other income increased 14.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for
currency) for the second quarter of 2008 versus the second quarter of 2007.
Overall, the increase was driven by approximately 8 points due to the effects
of currency and 6 points due to acquisitions.
 
The
companys effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2008 was 27.5 percent
versus 28.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007.
 
The
company generated $4,251 million in cash flow provided by operating activities,
an increase of $807 million, compared to the second quarter of 2007, primarily
driven by increased net income ($504 million) and changes in operating assets
and liabilities ($219 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,131
million was $980 million higher than the second quarter of 2007, primarily due
to the Telelogic acquisition. Net cash used in financing activities of $4,287
million was $995 million higher, primarily due to an increase in net payments
associated with debt ($11,646 million), partially offset by lower payments to
repurchase common stock ($10,071 million) in the second quarter of 2008 versus
the second quarter of 2007.
 
In
the second-quarter 2008, total Global Services signings increased 12 percent
year to year to $14,689 million ($12,152 million adjusted for currency, up 4
percent). Short-term signings were $6,962 million, an increase of 18 percent
year to year (9 percent adjusted for currency). Long-term signings were $7,728
million, an increase of 7 percent (flat adjusted for currency).  The estimated Global Services backlog, at
constant currency, was $117 billion at June 30, 2008, down $1 billion
versus the March 31, 2008 balance and up $1 billion versus the June 30,
2007 balance.

**   4.8 percent adjusted for currency
 
For
the first six months of 2008, total revenue increased 12.1 percent as reported,
4.8 percent adjusted for currency, versus the prior year. Pre-tax income from
continuing operations was $7,012 million, a 22.6 percent increase compared to
the first half of 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
was $3.63, reflecting a 32.0 percent improvement year to year.
 
Americas
revenue increased 8.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency), Europe
increased 17.9 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) and Asia Pacific
increased 15.0 (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the first half. In the
established countries, U.S. revenue growth was 6 percent and Canada increased 5
percent, adjusted for currency. In Europe, revenue adjusted for currency,
increased 3 percent in Germany, 3 percent in France, 3 percent in Italy and the
U.K. increased 4 percent. Japan revenue decreased 2 percent adjusted for
currency year to year.
 
Across
the geographies, aggregate revenue from the growth market countries increased
19.8 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2008
and represented approximately 17 percent of the companys geographic revenue.
Revenue in the key growth countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together
grew 28.6 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) in the first half of 2008
versus the first half of 2007.
 
The
increase in first half revenue was driven by strong double digit growth in the
Global Services segments. Global Technology Services revenue increased 16.2
percent, while Global Business Services revenue improved by 17.6 percent.  Software revenue increased 15.4 percent, led
by branded middleware and contributions from acquisitions. Systems and
Technology revenue decreased  2.0 percent
primarily driven by weaker performance in Microelectronics OEM, legacy System
i, System x and the prior year printer divestiture, partially offset by
increased revenue for the new z10 mainframe and growth in converged System p
servers and Storage. Total Systems revenue growth was 6.4 percent in the first
half. Global Financing revenue increased 4.5 percent reflecting an improvement
in financing revenue offset by a decline in used equipment sales.
 
The
gross profit margin was 42.4 percent, an increase of 1.4 points, primarily due
to improved margins in Global Technology Services (0.8 points of the increase),
improved margins and revenue mix in Systems and Technology (0.5 points of the
increase), improved margins in Global Business Services (0.3 point of the
increase) and improved revenue mix in Software (0.3 points of the increase).

Management Discussion 
(continued)
 
Total
expense and other income increased 12.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for
currency) for the first half of 2008 versus the first half of 2007. Overall,
the increase was driven by approximately 7 points due to the effects of
currency, 5 points due to acquisitions and 1 point from additional interest
expense associated with the 2007 accelerated share repurchase.
 
The
effective tax rate for the first six months of 2008 was 27.5 percent versus
28.2 percent for the comparable period in 2007.
 
The
company generated $8,453 million in cash flow provided by operating activities,
an increase of $1,993 million, compared to the first half of 2007, primarily
driven by increased net income ($979 million) and changes in operating assets
and liabilities ($627 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $6,909
million was $4,340 million higher than the first half of 2007, primarily due to
the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities of
$7,083 million was $2,075 million higher, primarily due to an increase in net
payments associated with debt ($13,658 million), partially offset by lower
payments to repurchase common stock ($11,041 million) in the first half of 2008
versus the first half of 2007.
 
Total
assets increased $497 million (decreased $2,065 million adjusted for currency)
from December 31, 2007, primarily driven by increased goodwill ($5,339
million) and intangible assets ($1,170 million) due primarily to the Cognos and
Telelogic acquisitions, increased prepaid pension assets ($1,610 million) and
prepaid expenses ($481 million), partially offset by lower cash and marketable
securities ($6,299 million), also due to the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions,
lower financing receivables ($1,176 million) and lower investments and sundry
assets ($932 million). The company had $9,847 million in cash and marketable
securities at June 30, 2008.
 
Total
liabilities increased $702 million (decreased $1,348 million adjusted for
currency) from December 31, 2007, primarily due to deferred income ($1,124
million), retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations ($661
million), other accruals ($636 million), deferred tax liabilities ($620
million) and income tax reserves ($457 million) , partially offset by lower
debt ($1,042 million), taxes ($842 million), accounts payable ($523 million)
and compensation and benefits ($357 million).
 
Stockholders
equity of $28,264 million decreased $205 million from December 31, 2007,
primarily due to increased treasury stock ($7,123 million) as a result of
common stock repurchases, partially offset by higher retained earnings ($3,816
million) due to net income and common stock ($2,694 million) driven by stock
option activity.

The companys Global
Services segments, Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, had
combined revenue of $15,206 million, an increase of 16.1 percent (8 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and $29,794 million, an increase
of 16.7 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of
2008, respectively, when compared to same periods of 2007.  Performance was broad based with double-digit
growth in all lines of businesses and across all geographies. This is the
fourth consecutive quarter of Global Services revenue growth in excess of the
companys longer term objective. Global Services is benefiting from both its
infrastructure offerings and offerings that drive cost savings and time to
value for clients. The growth markets are focused on the longer-term
infrastructure build outs, while the more established major markets are focused
on cost savings and value creation. In the second-quarter 2008, total Global
Services signings increased 12 percent year to year to $14,689 million ($12,152
million adjusted for currency, up 4 percent). Short-term signings were $6,962
million, an increase of 18 percent year to year (9 percent adjusted for
currency). Long-term signings were $7,728 million, an increase of 7 percent
(flat adjusted for currency). In the growth markets, adjusted for currency,
second quarter signings increased 25 percent, and long-term signings grew 70
percent. In the major markets, short-term signings increased 7 percent and long-term
signings were down 10 percent, respectively, adjusted for currency. The Global
Services segments delivered combined pre-tax profit of $1,631 million in the
second quarter and $3,199 million in the first six months of 2008, an
improvement of 28.1 percent and 31.9 percent, respectively, versus the same
periods of 2007.
 
Global
Technology Services (GTS) revenue increased 15.3 percent (8 percent adjusted
for currency) and 16.2 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively, versus the second quarter
and

first half of 2007. All
lines of business delivered double-digit revenue growth. Total signings in GTS
increased 14 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of
2008, with long-term signings increasing 13 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) and short-term signings increasing 16 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
Strategic
Outsourcing (SO) revenue was up 13.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and 14.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first six months of 2008, respectively, versus the same periods in 2007.
Revenue increased in all geographies driven by prior years signings and
continued growth in base accounts. SO signings in the second quarter of 2008
increased 7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) when compared to the
second quarter of 2007.
 
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 15.5 percent (8 percent adjusted
for currency) in the second quarter and 15.3 percent (8 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first six months of 2008 when compared to the same periods in
2007. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the key infrastructure
offerings. ITS signings in the second quarter increased 16 percent (9 percent
adjusted for currency) year to year. Signings were strong in key infrastructure
offerings such as Green Data Center and Converged Communications.
 
Maintenance
revenue increased 16.3 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) and 17.6
percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months
of 2008, respectively versus the same periods in the prior year. The company
continues to benefit from providing maintenance services on non-IBM IT
equipment, including services provided to Ricoh InfoPrint Solutions. This work
transitioned to Ricoh in June 2008.
 
Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue increased 29.2 percent (26 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and was up 31.4 percent (27
percent adjusted for currency) for the first six months of 2008, with
double-digit revenue growth in all geographies. The business process outsourcing
Daksh business delivered double-digit revenue growth again this quarter. BTO
signings, which can vary significantly period-to-period, increased 45 percent
(44 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter.
 
Global
Business Services (GBS) revenue increased 17.7 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) and 17.6 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first half of 2008, respectively, versus the prior year periods.
All geographies and industry sectors delivered double-digit revenue growth. The
Application Management Services and Core Consulting businesses both delivered
strong revenue performance again this quarter. Total signings in GBS increased
9 percent (decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of
2008. Short-term signings increased 19 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) as clients continue to be focused on projects with shorter-term
paybacks and ones that preserve cash, drive cost savings and help them meet
regulatory requirements. Long-term signings decreased 9 percent (20 percent
adjusted for currency) compared to a strong second quarter of 2007, which grew
70 percent versus the prior year.

GTS gross profit increased
22.3 percent in the second quarter and 24.1 percent in the first half of 2008
compared to the same periods of 2007, with gross profit margins improving 1.8
points and 2.0 points, respectively, year to year. Segment pre-tax profit
increased 26.2 percent to $994 million, with a pre-tax margin of 9.5 percent in
the second quarter of 2008, up 0.9 points versus second-quarter 2007. The first
half 2008 segment pre-tax profit increased 34.9 percent to $1,982 million, with
a pre-tax margin of 9.6 percent, an improvement of 1.4 points year to year. The
margin expansion was driven by an 
improved  cost structure resulting
from improved productivity and prior year restructuring, a mix to higher value
products in ITS and year-to-year savings in retirement-related costs.
 
GBS
gross profit increased 25.1 percent in the second quarter and 24.2 percent for
the first six months of 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007 with gross
profit margins improving 1.5 points and 1.4 points, respectively, year to year.
Segment pre-tax profit increased 31.2 percent to $637 million, with a pre-tax
margin of 11.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008, up 1.5 points year to
year. The first-half 2008 segment pre-tax profit increased 27.3 percent to
$1,216 million, with a pre-tax margin of 11.5 percent, an increase of 1.1
points versus the first six months of 2007. The margin improvements were driven
primarily by increased utilization, effective contract management and lower
retirement-related costs.
 
Global Services Signings
 
In addition to reporting
Global Services signings at constant currency, the company presents signings as
reported, or at actual rates. The company believes that presenting signings at
both actual rates and adjusted for currency provides investors with a more
complete view of its services business. In addition, reporting signings at
actual rates provides better comparability to other companies in the industry
who report signings using actual rates.

Global Services signings are
managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a
Global Services contract. Signings are used by management to assess period
performance of Global Services management. There are no third-party standards
or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by
management includes an approximation of currency and involves estimates and
judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and
duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down
costs. For example, for long-term contracts that require significant up-front
investment by the company, the portions of these contracts that are a signing

are those periods in which there is a significant
economic impact on the client if the commitment is not achieved, usually through
a termination charge or the client incurring significant wind-down costs as a
result of the termination. For short-term contracts that do not require
significant upfront investments, a signing is usually equal to the full
contract value. Long-term contracts represent SO and BTO contracts as well as
GBS contracts with the U.S. Federal government and its agencies and Application
Management Services (AMS) for custom and legacy applications. Short-term
contracts represent the remaining GBS offerings of Consulting and Systems
Integration, AMS for packaged applications and ITS contracts.
 
Signings include SO, BTO,
ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated
as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes SO, BTO,
ITS, GBS and Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work
under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations,
changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for
revenue not materialized and currency assumptions used to approximate constant
currency.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

versus the same periods in 2007. On June 1, 2007, the company completed
the divestiture of its printing business. Systems and Technology revenue,
excluding the divested printing business, increased 5.5 percent (essentially

3 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2008, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2007. See Note 9
on page 16 for additional information regarding this divestiture.  Total Systems revenue increased 9.9 percent
(4 percent adjusted for currency) and 6.4 percent (down 1 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively,
compared to the prior year periods.
 
System z revenue increased
32.1 percent and 22.6 percent (23 percent and 14 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2008
versus the second quarter and first six months of 2007, respectively. MIPS
(millions of instructions per second) shipments increased 34 percent and
25 percent in the second quarter and first half of 2008 versus the second
quarter and first half of 2007, respectively, reflecting
strength in both traditional and specialty workloads. These increases were
primarily driven by the new System z10 enterprise class server announced at the
end of February. Customers are leveraging the z10 to reduce their technology
and energy costs as they simplify their data centers. Revenue growth was
particularly strong in the Americas and Europe, as well as in the Financial
Services sector.
 
Converged System p revenue increased 28.7 percent and
15.8 percent (23 percent and 10 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the second quarter
and first six months of 2007, respectively. The 
revenue growth was primarily driven by strong performance in midrange
servers which increased 68 percent in the second quarter of 2008 versus the
second quarter of 2007, following almost a 60 percent increase in the first
quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. High-end servers increased 21
percent in the second quarter, driven by the new POWER6 595 high-end server,
which was announced early in the quarter. With POWER6 performance now available
across the entire product line, this platform is well positioned to sustain its
technical and market leadership.
 
The companys
legacy System i revenue decreased 46.9 percent and 35.6 percent
(50 percent and 40 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the same periods in 2007,
respectively, as the company transitions the System i customer base to the
converged POWER platform within System p.
 
System x revenue decreased
7.7 percent and 4.9 percent (13 percent and 10 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively, versus the second quarter and first six
months of 2007. System x server revenue declined 5 percent and 2 percent in the
second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the comparable periods of
2007, respectively. High-end server revenue increased 23 percent and 18 percent
for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the same periods in
2007, respectively, offset by continued softness in low-end server revenue.
Blades revenue increased 14 percent and 21 percent in the second quarter and
first half of 2008 versus the second quarter and first half of 2007,
respectively.
 
Storage revenue increased
11.8 percent and 10.8 percent (6 percent and 5 percent adjusted
for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the
comparable periods in 2007. Total disk revenue increased 20 percent and 13 percent
in the second quarter of 2008 and the first six months of 2008 versus the
second quarter and first six months of 2007, respectively. These increases were
driven by growth in Enterprise Disk (18 percent and 17 percent for the periods)
on continued strength of the DS8000 product and increased midrange and low-end
disk revenue. Tape revenue declined 2 percent in the second quarter of 2008 and
increased 6 percent for the first six months of 2008 versus the comparable
periods of 2007, respectively. The decline in the second quarter was due to a
pause by clients in advance of the new high-end product which was announced in
mid July.
 
Microelectronics
OEM revenue decreased 19.3 percent and 19.4 percent (20 percent and 20 percent
adjusted for currency), respectively, for the second quarter and first six
months of 2008 versus the comparable periods of 2007, respectively. The
primary mission of this business is to provide leadership technology for the
systems business, as demonstrated during the first half of 2008 in the new z10
mainframe and POWER6 systems.
 
Retail Stores
Solutions revenue increased 0.2 percent and declined 1.3 percent (down 4
percent and 6 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first
six months of 2008 versus the same periods in 2007, respectively, while
Printing Systems revenue decreased as a result of the divestiture of the
business in the second quarter of 2007.

profit for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the same
periods of 2007 were primarily due to the increases in revenue in converged
System p and System z.
 
Overall, gross margin in the
second quarter increased 1.3 points versus the prior year. Converged System p
performance contributed 1.6 points to the overall margin improvement, while the
divestiture of the printing business contributed 0.6 points. These increases
were offset by lower margins in Microelectronics OEM and legacy System i, which
impacted the overall margin by 0.8 points and 0.2 points, respectively. First
half gross margin increased 1.8 points compared to the first half of 2007.
Converged System p, the divestiture of the printing business, Storage, Retail
Stores Solutions and System x contributed 1.4 points, 0.6 points, 0.4 points,
0.2 points and 0.2 points, respectively, to this improvement, partially offset
by lower margins in Microelectronics OEM and legacy System i, which impacted
the overall margin by 1.0 points and 0.2 points, respectively.
 
Systems and Technologys
pre-tax income increased 20.7 percent in the second quarter, and 27.5 percent
for the first six months when compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin
increased 1.2 points and 1.3 points in the second quarter and first six months,
respectively, versus the prior year periods reflecting the ongoing shift to
higher value as clients virtualize their IT environments.

Software
segment revenue increased 16.7 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) to
$5,574 million and 15.4 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) to $10,421
million in the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively,
versus the same periods in 2007, reflecting continued strong demand for the Key
Branded Middleware products and contribution from acquisitions.
 
Revenue from Key Branded Middleware increased 21.3
percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2008 and
20.4 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of
2008, when compared to the same periods in 2007 and represented 55 percent (54
percent for first six months) of total quarterly software segment revenue. The
company continues to invest in these products and expects the majority of its
software revenue growth to come from this portion of the portfolio. Demand for
the branded middleware products in the second quarter continued to reflect
customers investments in software to improve their cost effectiveness and
business performance, manage regulatory requirements and improve the
productivity of their workforce.
 
Revenue
from the WebSphere Family of products increased 9.3 percent (2 percent adjusted
for currency) and 13.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively, versus the same periods in
2007, led by double-digit growth in WebSphere Application Servers. Revenue from
WebSphere products continues to increase as customers use the power of the Web
to lower their cost and expand their reach. The company acquired InfoDyne
Corporation in the quarter. InfoDyne complements the companys broad set of
software products for the financial markets.
 
Information
Management revenue increased 29.5 percent and 28.4 percent (21 percent and 20
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2008, respectively, versus the second quarter and first six months of 2007.
Revenue performance was driven by contribution from the Cognos acquisition as
well as growth of over 30 percent in the distributed relational database
product set. Information Management products provide information On Demand to
help customers improve their business performance.
 
Lotus
revenue increased 20.9 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) and 18.8
percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2008, respectively, versus the same periods in 2007 as customers
continue to invest to improve the personal productivity of their
workforce.  This was the 15th
consecutive quarter of revenue growth from Lotus software.
 
Tivoli
revenue increased 9.3 percent and 9.4 percent (3 percent and 3 percent adjusted
for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the
second quarter and first six months of 2007, led by double digit growth in
Tivoli Security and Storage Management products. This was the 15th consecutive
quarter of strong revenue growth in Storage Management software. These products
provide clients with solutions that address complex regulatory requirements.
 
Rational revenue increased
37.0 percent and 21.0 percent (28 percent and 13 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively, versus the
comparable prior year periods.  The
Telelogic AB acquisition was completed in the quarter and contributed to the
revenue growth in the brand.  The
Rational software tooling portfolio helps customers increase workforce
productivity. With the addition of Telelogic, the company has the software
tooling to support both applications and embedded systems development.

Software
segment gross profit increased 16.3 percent to $4,717 million for the second
quarter and 15.4 percent to $8,783 million for the first six months of 2008,
driven primarily by revenue growth. Gross profit margin was 84.6 percent in the
second quarter, down 0.3 points year to year and was 84.3 percent in the first
six months, flat year to year. The software gross profit margin decline in the
second quarter was driven primarily by the integration of the Cognos and
Telelogic acquisitions.
 
The
Software segment contributed $1,492 million of pre-tax profit in the second
quarter of 2008, an increase of 19.4 percent, and $2,759 million in the first
six months, an increase of 20.7 percent, when compared to the same periods of
2007. The segment pre-tax profit margin was 23.7 percent and 23.4 percent in
the second quarter and first six months of 2008, up 0.2 points and 0.9 points,
respectively, versus the prior year periods. Revenue growth and productivity,
partially offset by increased costs of acquisitions, drove the pre-tax margin
improvements.

Revenue increased
consistently in all geographies when adjusted for currency in the second
quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007, and growth rates
accelerated sequentially from the first-quarter 2008. Adjusted for currency,
revenue growth was led by Europe and the growth market countries.
 
Americas
revenue increased 8.2 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter. The U.S. had another good quarter with revenue increasing 5.0 percent
compared to the second quarter of 2007. 
Latin America revenue increased 29.6 percent (15 percent adjusted for
currency) and Canada revenue increased 19.7 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
Europe/Middle
East/Africa (EMEA) revenue increased 19.9 percent (7 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter of 2008 when compared to the second quarter of
2007. Adjusted for currency, the rate of growth improved over the past several
quarters.  In the major countries,
Germany revenue increased 24.7 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency),
France revenue increased 23.2 percent (increased 6 percent adjusted for
currency), Italy revenue increased 21.3 percent (5 percent adjusted for
currency), the U.K. revenue increased 3.2 percent (4 percent adjusted for
currency) and Spain revenue increased 27.5 percent (10 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
Asia
Pacific revenue increased 15.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter of 2008 versus the prior year second quarter.  Growth was led by the India, Greater China,
Australia/New Zealand, Korea and ASEAN regions, where the economies and IT
markets continue to expand, with combined revenue growth of 18.2 percent (13
percent adjusted for currency). Japan revenue increased 13.1 percent, as
reported, in the quarter, but declined 2 percent adjusted for currency.
 
Across
the geographies, aggregate revenue from the countries comprising the companys
new growth markets organization increased 20.8 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter of 2008 and represented approximately 18
percent of the companys geographic revenue in the quarter.  Revenue performance in these markets accelerated
sequentially from the first quarter as the company continues to invest to
capture the opportunities created from the build-out of the infrastructures in
these high growth economies. These rapidly growing markets are expected to
continue to drive the companys revenue and profit in the second half of 2008.
The BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 30.5
percent (20 percent adjusted for currency), led by growth in India of 35.4
percent (37 percent adjusted for currency). Brazil revenue increased 39.8
percent (17 percent adjusted for currency), China revenue increased 26.2
percent (19 percent adjusted for currency) while Russia revenue increased 2.8
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to a very strong second
quarter, 2007.
 
OEM
revenue decreased 17.2 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) in the
quarter driven by reduced demand in the Microelectronics OEM business.

first half of 2008, aligning investments to growth opportunities on a global
basis. The total expense and other income to revenue ratio was 29.0 percent and
28.7 percent for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus 28.6
percent and 28.6 percent for the second quarter and first six months of 2007,
respectively. Total expense and other income increased 14.6 percent and 12.8
percent in the second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively. Overall,
these increases were primarily driven by approximately 8 points and 7 points
due to the effects of currency and approximately 6 points and 5 points due to
acquisitions for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the
comparable periods in 2007, respectively.

Total Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased
11.7 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and 11.1 percent (5
percent adjusted for currency), respectively, in the second quarter and first
six months of 2008 versus the same periods in 2007.  The increases in SG&A were primarily due
to the effects of currency (6 points in the second quarter and first six months
of 2008) and acquisition related spending, predominantly for Cognos and
Telelogic, which accounted for approximately 6 points and 5 points of the
increase for the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively. In
addition, bad debt expense increased in both the second quarter and first six
months of 2008 driven by a higher level of receivables and additional reserves
for specific customers. This increased the companys accounts receivable
provision coverage by 10 basis points from the first quarter to 1.7 percent at June 30,
2008. These increases were partially offset by lower retirement-related expense
in the second quarter and first six months of 2008. See Note 5 on pages 10
to 12 and the caption Retirement-Related Benefits on page 40 for

Other (income) and expense was income of $24 million and
$253 million in the second quarter of 2008 and 2007, and income of $149
million and $432 million for the first six months of 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The decrease in income in the second quarter was primarily driven
by increased losses on derivative instruments of $180 million. The
company hedges its major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of
currency volatility in its global cash planning, which also reduces volatility
in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is
primarily reflected in Other (income) and expense, as well as cost of goods
sold. The impact of losses from these cash flow hedges reflected in Other
(income) and expense was $122 million, an increase of $87 million year to year
in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in interest income in the
second quarter was primarily driven by declining interest rates.
 
The decrease in income for the first six months of 2008 was primarily
driven by increased foreign currency transaction losses of $156 million, lower
interest income of $54 million primarily driven by lower rates and increased
losses on derivative instruments of $26 million. The impact of losses
from the cash flow hedges reflected in Other (income) and expense was $231
million, an increase of $169 million year to year in the first six months of
2008.
 
In addition, net gains from securities and investments primarily
reflects sales of Lenovo stock in both the second quarter of 2008 and 2007, and
the first six months of 2008 and 2007. In the second quarter of 2008, the
company converted approximately 375 million 
non-voting Lenovo shares into voting shares. As a result of the conversion
and the sales of shares, the companys ownership in Lenovo declined from total
ownership of 8.8 percent at December 31, 2007 to voting ownership of 5.6
percent at June 30, 2008.

The increase
for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 was due to increased
spending in Software  ($86 million
and $159 million) primarily resulting from acquisitions. In addition,
Systems and Technology spending increased $7 million and decreased $36 million
and other unit spending increased $33 million and $63 million for the second
quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively, versus the prior year
periods.

The increase in interest
expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2008 versus the same
periods of 2007 was primarily due to the increase in debt associated with the
financing of the ASR agreements in 2007, partially offset by lower interest
rates. See Note 7 on page 14 for additional information. Interest expense
is presented in Cost of Financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings
only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing
external business. See page 54 for additional information regarding Global
Financing debt and interest expense. Overall interest expense for the second
quarter and first six months of 2008 was $330 million and $714 million, a
decrease of $6 million and an increase of $117 million, respectively.

The company had income of $106 million and incurred costs of
$322 million associated with its defined benefit pension plans for the
second quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The comparable amounts for the
first six months of 2008 and 2007 was income of $206 million and costs of
$635 million, respectively. The decrease in cost was primarily
driven by benefit accruals no longer being recorded for the IBM Personal
Pension Plan, effective January 1, 2008, as well as by lower cost due to
amortization of prior years actual return on assets exceeding expected return
on assets and lower cost due to recognized actuarial losses. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in the cost of defined
contribution plans of $184 million and $418 million in the second quarter and
first six months of 2008 versus the same periods of 2007. These increases in cost were primarily driven
by pension redesign efforts, primarily in the IBM 401(k) Plus Plan in the
U.S., effective January 1, 2008. See Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits,
in the companys 2007 Annual Report for additional information on these plan
changes. The second quarter 2008 year-to-year decrease in total cost
impacted gross profit, SG&A expense and RD&E expense by approximately
$164 million, $59 million and $25 million, respectively . The first half
decrease in total cost impacted gross profit, SG&A expense and RD&E
expense by approximately $282 million, $108 million and
$45 million, respectively.
 
Acquired
Intangible Asset Amortization
 
The company has been
investing in targeted acquisitions primarily within the Software and Global
Services segments to increase its capabilities in higher value market segments.
The following table presents the total acquired intangible asset amortization
by reportable segment included in the referenced category in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.

Taxes
 
The
effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2008 was 27.5 percent compared
with an effective tax rate of 28.0 percent for the second quarter of 2007. The
corresponding effective tax rates for the first six months of 2008 and 2007
were 27.5 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively. The decline in the tax rates
was due to a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions together
with an increase in certain tax incentives offset by a reduction in the U.S.
research tax credit which expired in December 2007 and the absence of the
gain associated with the sale of the printing business in 2007.
 
During
the second quarter of 2008, the company reached an agreement with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) regarding claims for certain tax incentives.  The resolution of this matter resulted in a
net reduction of the second quarter
 
41

provision
for income taxes of $281 million. Also during the second quarter, the company
completed its analysis with respect to certain issues associated with recently
issued U.S. tax regulations.  The review
resulted in a reduction of the second quarter provision for income taxes of
$200 million.  The above benefits were
predominately offset by a one-time tax cost associated with the intercompany
transfer of certain intellectual property.
 
The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 determined in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, increased by
$215 million in the first six months to $3,309 million. The amount of
unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $73 million during the second quarter of
2008. Including the items described above, the decrease reflects various
impacts including additions for current year tax positions of $574 million and
reductions for prior year tax positions of $655 million. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized,
would favorably affect the effective tax rate is $2,596 million at June 30,
2008.
 
With
limited exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
local or non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through
2001. The years subsequent to 2001 contain matters that could be subject to
differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates
to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
The IRS commenced the audit
of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in the first quarter of
2007. The company anticipates that the IRS will complete its field examination
of the companys 2004-2005 income tax returns during the fourth quarter of
2008.
 
The
company has certain foreign tax loss carryforwards that have not been reflected
in the gross deferred tax asset balance. These losses, the potential tax
benefit of which is approximately $1.1 billion, have not been recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the company has not determined
if it will claim these losses. The company is currently evaluating whether to
claim these losses and expects to make a decision within the next 12 months.
 
See
the 2007 IBM Annual Report,
Note O, Taxes, for additional information.
 
Earnings Per
Share
 
Basic earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.  Diluted
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options, stock awards and convertible notes.

Actual shares
outstanding at June 30, 2008 was 1,354.8 million. The weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the second quarter
and first six months of 2008 was 65.0 million and 91.7 million lower
than the same periods in 2007 primarily as a result of the companys common
share repurchase program.

Working capital decreased
$7,239 million compared to the year-end 2007 position primarily as a result of
a decrease in current assets. The key drivers are described below:
 
Current assets decreased
$6,866 million, including a currency benefit of $1,212 million, due to:
 
·                  A decrease of $6,299 million in cash and
cash equivalents and marketable securities including a $182 million currency benefit
(see cash flow analysis on pages 44 and 45); and
 
·                  A decline of $1,561 million in short-term
receivables driven by:
 
-                 a decrease of $2,467 million due to
collections of higher year-end balances, offset by
 
-                 approximately $906 million currency impact.
 
·                  An increase of $481 million in prepaid
expenses and other current assets primarily resulting from:
 
-                 an increase of $259 million in derivative
assets primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates;
 
-                 an increase of $163 million in prepaid
software for services contracts; and
 
-                 approximately $64 million currency
impact.
 
·                  An increase of $262 million in deferred
taxes primarily due to an increase in tax deductions expected to be realized
within the next 12 months.
 
·                  Growth of $252 million in inventory
primarily driven by the manufacturing ramp to support the new Systems and
Technology z10 mainframe and POWER6 product announcements.

Table of

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Current liabilities
increased $373 million, including a $814 million impact from currency, as a
result of:
 
·                  An increase in deferred income of $1,013
million, which includes $340 million due to currency, driven by Software ($458
million) and Global Technology Services ($364 million);
 
·                  An increase of $643 million in other
accrued expenses and liabilities primarily driven by increased derivative
liabilities due to changes in foreign currency rates;
 
·                  An increase in short-term debt of $475
million primarily driven by;
 
-                 Reclasses of $4,260 million from
long-term debt to short-term debt to reflect maturity dates, and
 
-                 $688 million in new debt issuances;
partially offset by
 
-                 $2,340 million in payments and a $2,206
million reduction in commercial paper.
 
·                  A decrease of $842 million in taxes
payable primarily due to income tax payments in the first half of 2008; and
 
·                  A decrease in accounts payable of $523
million (including a currency impact of $186 million) and a decrease of $357
million (including a currency impact of $124 million) in compensation and
benefits reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances.

·                  An increase in cash driven by accounts
payable of $355 million; partially offset by
 
·                  A decrease in cash from deferred income
of $533 million primarily driven by a prior year prepayment of future services
related to the divestiture of the printing business.
 
Net cash used in
investing activities increased $4,340 million driven by:
 
·                  An increase of $5,650 million in

·                  The net impact of the purchases and sales
of marketable securities and other investments which resulted in an increase in
cash of $1,729 million;
 
Net cash used in
financing activities increased $2,075 million as a result of:
 
·                  Increase of $13,658 million in net cash
payments to settle debt; partially offset by,
 
·                  Lower common stock repurchases of $11,041

Long-term debt decreased
$1,518 million primarily due to reclasses to short-term debt of $4,260 million,
as certain instruments approach maturity; offset by net debt issuances of
$2,590 million.
 
Other noncurrent liabilities, excluding debt,
increased $1,846 million primarily driven by:

Global Financing provides
funding predominantly for the companys external client assets as well as for
assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global
Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global
Financing asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these Global Services assets
are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 54.
 
In January, IBM International
Group Capital LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, issued
$3.5 billion of 18 month floating rate notes. The proceeds were used to reduce
the 364-day bridge loan associated with the 2007 ASR. As of March 31,
2008, the bridge loan was fully paid off.
 
Non-global financing debt
decreased $1,682 million and the debt-to-capitalization ratio decreased to 26.9
percent from 30.0 percent at December 31, 2007. The companys long-term
debt-to-capitalization ratio objective is 20 to 30 percent. This ratio can vary
from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt
positions.
 
Equity
 
Stockholders equity
decreased $205 million primarily as a result of a decrease related to net stock
transactions of $4,430 million, driven by the companys common stock
repurchases which resulted in an increase in Treasury stock at June 30,
2008, partially offset by a $3,816 million increase in retained earnings driven
by net income.
 
Looking Forward
 
The following key drivers
impacting IBMs business are described in more detail in the 2007 IBM Annual
Report on page 22.
 
·        Economic environment and corporate spending budgets
·        Internal business transformation and global
integration initiatives
·        Innovation initiatives
·        Open standards
·        Investing in growth opportunities
 
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in 170 countries, with approximately 63
percent of its 2007 revenue and 65 percent of its first half of 2008 revenue
generated outside the U.S. In addition, approximately 70 percent of the companys
employees are located outside the United States, including about 36 percent in
Asia Pacific. This global reach gives the company access to markets, with
well-established organizations and management systems who understand the
clients and their challenges and who can respond to these opportunities with
value-add solutions. The companys transformation to a globally integrated
enterprise provides the capabilities to service clients globally and deliver the
best skills and cost from anywhere in the world.
 
In May 2007, the company met with investors and analysts and discussed
a road map to deliver earnings per share in 2010 in the range of $10 to $11 per
share, or 14 to 16 percent compound growth rate from 2006. The companys 2010
road map is to generate earnings per share growth through a combination of
revenue growth, margin improvement, growth initiatives, acquisitions, the
current projected benefit of retirement-related cost and effective capital
deployment to fund growth and provide returns to stockholders through dividends
and common stock repurchases. In March 2008, the company met again with
investors and analysts and discussed the progress the company is making on its
2010 roadmap.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
The companys performance in the first six months of 2008 highlighted the
benefits of its global reach and the strength of its business model. The
financial results reflected solid progress on major elements of the long-term
goals; however, the company measures the success of its business model over the
long term, not any individual quarter or year. The companys strategies,
investments and actions are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term
performance.
 
In the emerging growth markets, the company will continue to invest for
revenue growth and leadership. The company is focused on identifying growth
opportunities and following a disciplined investment policy to capitalize on
these opportunities. Through its investments, the company has developed
extensive capabilities in emerging countries to capture these growth
opportunities. In 2008, the company implemented a new organization and
management structure that will increase its focus on these growth markets. The
company expects these rapidly growing markets to drive revenue and profit
growth in the second half of 2008 and beyond.
 
The company is a proven infrastructure provider of IT technology. The
companys broad product and services portfolio delivers value to clients 
through a combination of services, hardware and software. The portfolio is
focused on high-value solutions that can deliver measurable benefit to clients
with offerings that can address a wide scope of client issues including: energy
savings, security and resiliency, risk management and cost reduction among many
others.
 
The company remains committed to technology leadership and will continue to
focus internal investments, complemented with strategic acquisitions, on
high-value, high-growth opportunities. In July, the company announced that it
plans to invest $1.5 billion to promote nanotechnology research and advanced
semiconductor technology.
 
The continued investments in Software have led to this segments emergence
as a strong source of revenue growth and the largest contributor to the companys
profit in 2007. The Software business is differentiated in the industry by both
the strength of its individual products and the breadth of the software
offerings. The key to continued Software growth stems from the ability to
maintain and grow this industry-leading software business, and by continuing to
capitalize on industry trends such as SOA and Information on Demand. The
company expects to accomplish this through a combination of internal development
and strategic acquisitions. These products will be rapidly developed and
integrated to bring continued value to clients.
 
Within the Global Services business, revenue and profit growth improved and
the company continues to see significant results from the targeted actions and
investments it has made the last few years. The Global Services business enters
the third quarter with strong executional momentum and with a signings backlog
of $117 billion, an increase of $1 billion from the prior year. The portfolio
is strong with a complement of offerings and capabilities that deliver both
high value and productivity to clients. The overall Global Services business is
well positioned going forward to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace.
 
In the Systems and Technology business, the company will focus its
investments on differentiating technologies with high-growth potential
including POWER6, BladeCenter-S, high-performance computing, virtualization and
energy efficiency. The transition to POWER6 technology was completed in the
first half of 2008. The April product announcements in converged System p
have provided momentum for this brand going-forward. Within Storage, the
company has started to integrate the recently acquired (December 2007) XIV
technologies into its portfolio.
 
The company expects 2008 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be
approximately $1.6 billion, a decrease of $950 million to $1 billion compared
to 2007. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions and the
impacts of pension plan redesign efforts. Through June 30, 2008, the IBM
Personal Pension Plans year-to-date return on assets was (2.2) percent. See
the companys 2007 Annual Report Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, on page 105
for additional information.
 
The company expects that its effective tax rate in 2008 will be
approximately 27.5 percent. This rate is lower than the 2007 tax rate of 28.1
percent due to an expectation of a more favorable mix of income in lower tax
jurisdictions, increased tax incentives and foreign tax credits associated with
foreign dividend repatriation, offset by a reduction in tax credits, including
the U.S. research credit which expired in December 2007. The rate may
change period to period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement
of income tax audits, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix
of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
In 2007 and 2006, the companys cash tax rate was approximately 18 percent
and 16 percent, respectively.
 
47





Table of Contents
 
Management Discussion  (continued)
 
The companys cash tax rate represents the amount of income taxes paid
during the year over Income from continuing
operations before income taxes. The cash
tax rate differs from the companys effective tax rate due to a number of
variables including, but not limited to, certain items of income and expense that are
recognized in different years for financial reporting purposes than for
income tax purposes, differences in currency rates used in the translation of
the non-U.S. income tax provision and income tax payments and current year
cash tax payments or refunds that are related to prior years. The company
anticipates that its cash tax rate may increase in the near term as a result of
the settlement of audits.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At June 30, 2008, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more U.S. dollars than at
year-end 2007. The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to
limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in the 2007 IBM Annual Report in Note K, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 88 to 91.
 
In the first half of 2008, the companys revenue
increased 12.1 percent as reported and 4.8 percent adjusted for currency. This
currency benefit was driven from the companys operations in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar. The company maintains currency hedging programs for cash
planning purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the companys financial results. In addition to the
translation of earnings, the impact of currency changes also may affect the
companys pricing and sourcing actions. For example, the company may procure
components and supplies in multiple functional currencies and sell products and
services in other currencies. Since the company operates in a very competitive
environment, it believes that some of this currency-based cost advantage is
passed on to the client in reduced price. Therefore, it is impractical to
quantify the impact of currency on these transactions and on consolidated net
income. In the first half of 2008, the company believes that the extended
period of U.S. dollar weakness was positive for the companys net income,
although the precise impact is difficult to assess.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking
prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into foreign
currency hedge contracts.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
In the companys 2007 IBM
Annual Report, on pages 44 to 46, there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table
presented on page 44 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and
marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities
for each of the past five years. For the six months ended or as of, as
applicable, June 30, 2008, those amounts are $8.5 billion for net cash
from operating activities, $9.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and
$10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30,
2008 appear in the table below and remain unchanged from December 31,
2007. The company has no contractual arrangements that, in the event of a
change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its
financial position or liquidity.

The table appearing on page 45
of the 2007 IBM Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews
cash flows for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description
of the way cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. While the company
prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with SFAS No. 95,
Statement of Cash Flows, on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and discusses
causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on pages 44
and 45, the following is the management view of cash flows for the first six
months of 2008 and 2007 prepared in a manner consistent with the table on page 45
of the 2007 IBM Annual Report:

Free cash flow for the
first six months of 2008 increased $1,763 million versus the first six months
of 2007. The improvement year to year was driven by the increase in net income,
good working capital management, particularly in accounts receivable, and lower
retirement-related plan funding. There were several significant uses of cash in
the first half of 2008 including the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions and capital
investments. Also, in the first six months of 2008, $8.4 billion was returned
to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 
In February, the companys
Board of Directors authorized $15 billion in additional funds for use in the
companys common stock repurchase program. The company anticipates spending up
to $12 billion on share repurchases in 2008. At June 30, 2008, the company
had $8.9 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
 
At December 31,
2007, the company had liabilities of $937 million, representing the fair value
of derivative investments in qualifying net investment hedge relationships.
During the first half of 2008, the company took actions to reduce hedge levels
in some currencies. See the 2007 Annual Report, Note K, Derivatives and
Hedging Transactions, for additional information. In the first six months of
2008, the company had a use of cash in investing activities of $207 million related
to these instruments. The company will reflect a use of cash in investing
activities of $531 million for 2008 and estimates a use of cash of $513 million
in 2009, related to these liabilities.
 
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include
significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic
sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension
funding during periods of severe and prolonged downturn in the capital markets.
Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of
variables, which are more completely described in Note 14 on pages 18 to
21 of this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company is not
quantifying any future impact from pension funding because it is not possible
to predict future movements in the capital markets.

The
increase in revenue, in the second quarter of 2008, as compared to the same
period in 2007, was primarily due to:
 
·                  An increase in external revenue of 6.1
percent (2 percent decline adjusted for currency), due to growth in financing
revenue (up 10.3 percent to $494 million), offset by a decrease in used
equipment sales (down 6.4 percent to $140 million); and
 
·                  Growth in internal revenue of 54.0 percent
driven by an increase in used equipment sales to the System and Technology
segment to support their external sales (up 86.3 percent to $343 million) and
an increase in internal financing (up 16.1 percent to $182 million).
 
The
increase in external and internal financing revenue was primarily due to higher
average asset balances.
 
The
increase in revenue, in the first six months of 2008, as compared to the same
period in 2007, was primarily due to:
 
·                  An increase in external revenue of 4.5
percent (3 percent decline adjusted for currency) due to growth in financing
revenue (up 11.3 percent to $989 million), offset by a decrease in used
equipment sales (down 14.1 percent to $277 million); and
 
·                  Growth in internal revenue of 32.1 percent
driven by an increase in used equipment sales to the System and Technology
segment to support their external sales (up 48.4 percent to $525 million) and
an increase in internal financing (up 15.0 percent to $386 million).
 
The
increase in external and internal financing revenue was due to higher average
asset balances and higher asset yields.
 
Global Financing gross
profit increased 29.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the
same period in 2007, with gross margin increasing 2.8 points.  Gross profit increased 17.9 percent in the
first half of 2008 compared to the prior year, with gross margin increasing 1.6
points.  The improvement in both periods
was primarily due to an improvement in equipment sales margins.
 
Global Financing pre-tax
income increased 28.7 percent in the second quarter of 2008 versus the second
quarter of 2007, primarily driven by the increase in gross profit of $154
million, offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable provisions of
$38 million and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense of
$16 million. Pre-tax income increased 15.6 percent in the first six months of
2008 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in gross
profit of $188 million, offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable
provisions of $41 million and an increase in selling, general and
administrative expense of $30 million.
 
The increase in return on
equity from second quarter 2008 to the same period in 2007 and for the first
six months of 2008 compared to the first six months of 2007 was primarily due
to higher after-tax income.

Sources
and Uses of Funds
 
The
primary use of funds in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial
financing assets. Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware,
software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment,
software and services to meet IBM clients total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for equipment as well as loans for
hardware, software and services with terms generally for two to seven years.
Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services and are
unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis in order to
mitigate the associated risk. Loan agreements include credit protective
language and dollar limits on how much can be financed in order to minimize
credit risk. Client financing also includes internal activity as described on page 51
of the 2007 IBM Annual Report.
 
Commercial
financing receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable
financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts receivable financing
generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term receivables are primarily
unsecured and are also subject to additional credit actions in order to
mitigate the associated risk.

Total
new originations exceeded cash collections of commercial financing assets in
the second quarter of 2008, which resulted in a net increase in financing
assets in this period. Cash collections of both client and commercial financing
assets exceeded new financing originations in the first six months of 2008,
which resulted in a net decline in financing assets from December 31,
2007. The increase in originations in both periods was due to improving volumes
in both client and commercial financing over the first six months of 2008
versus 2007.
 
Cash
generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany
payables and dividends to IBM.

The percentage of
financing receivables reserved increased from 1.3 percent at December 31,
2007 to 1.5 percent at June 30, 2008 due to the increase in the specific
allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Specific reserves increased 13.9 percent from December 31, 2007 to June 30,
2008.  Unallocated reserves decreased $13
million in the same period due to the decline in gross financing receivables.
 
Global
Financings bad debt expense was $33 million for the six months ended June 30,
2008, compared with a decrease of $8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2007. The increase was primarily attributed to the increase in specific
reserves.
 
In the second quarter of
2008, compared to the second quarter of 2007, bad debt expense increased $38
million.

unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon
the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease
inception.  Global Financing has insight
into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global Financing optimizes the recovery of residual
values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to
new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of
equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment returned at the end of a
lease, represented 41.7 percent of Global Financings revenue in the second
quarter and 36.9 percent for the first six months of 2008 and 35.6 percent in
both the second quarter and first six months of 2007.  The increase in the second quarter of 2008
and the first six months of 2008 was driven primarily by the increase in
internal used sales to the Systems and Technology segment.  The gross margins on these sales were 50.1
percent and 42.8 percent in the second quarter of 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  The increase is driven
primarily by a shift in mix towards higher margin internal sales and higher
margins on external used equipment sales. 
The gross margins were 47.8 percent and 43.3 percent for the first six
months of 2008 and 2007, respectively.  This increase
is primarily driven by a shift in mix towards higher margin
internal sales and higher margins on internal used equipment sales.
 
The
following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type and direct financing leases and operating leases at December 31,
2007 and June 30, 2008. In addition, the table presents the residual value
as a percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of when
the unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at June 30,
2008 is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that are
utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease or
operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees were
$280 million and $190 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007,
respectively, and $478 million and $317 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. The associated
aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were
$18 million and $7 million for the financing transactions originated
during the quarters ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007,
respectively, and $30 million and $14 million for the financing
transactions originated during the six months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30,
2007, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $2.3 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2008 and $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30,
2007, and $4 million and $2 million for each of the six months ended June 30,
2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively.

The
company funds Global Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio
target of approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets
is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany
loans are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency
underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both
assets and debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 51.
 
The
Global Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys
external clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company. As
previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as
if it were a standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to
debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is
included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 50 and in
Segment Information on pages 63 and 64.
 
In
the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on pages 3 and 4,
however, the interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
The following table provides additional
information on debt. In this table, Intercompany activity is comprised of
internal loans and leases at arms-length pricing in support of Global Services
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately levered in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Looking
Forward
 
The Global Financing
business continues to be well positioned to grow in the current environment.
The companys financial position provides substantial flexibility and funding
capacity. Global Financings assets and new financing volumes are primarily IBM
products and services financed to the companys clients and business partners
and substantially all financing assets are IT related assets which provide a
stable base of business for future growth.
 
The companys recently
announced System z and high-end converged System p servers are a significant
financing opportunity. Global Financings offerings are competitive and
available to clients as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access to
the capital markets. Overall, Global Financings originations will be dependent
upon the demand for IT products and services, as well as client participation
rates.
 
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing funding strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact
the credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore
the level of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 53,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both
through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its
remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has
policies in place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These
policies, combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the
prudent management of the business going forward, even during periods of
uncertainty with respect to the economy.
