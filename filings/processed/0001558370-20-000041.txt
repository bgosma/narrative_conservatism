Table of ContentsRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES​NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS​For the Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Week Periods Ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018​(Dollars and share information in thousands, except per share amounts)​(unaudited)​1. Basis of Presentation​The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete annual financial statements. The accompanying financial information reflects all adjustments which are of a recurring nature and, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results of operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”) and Subsidiaries (together with Rite Aid, the “Company”) Fiscal 2019 10-K.​In addition to the significant accounting policies discussed in the Company’s Fiscal 2019 10-K, the Company has added the following significant accounting policies as a result of its adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and 2018-11, Leases, (Topic 842) on March 3, 2019 under the alternative transition method as permissible under ASU 2018-11 (please see Note 12. Leases, for additional details).​Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements​In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (Topic 842) (“ASU-2016-02” or the “Lease Standard”), which is intended to improve financial reporting around leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that engage in lease transactions (both lessee and lessor). This ASU requires organizations that lease assets—referred to as “lessees”—to recognize on the balance sheet a right of use asset (“ROU asset”) and a lease liability for the obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning January 1, 2019.​During July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. The ASU provides administrative relief by allowing entities to implement the Lease Standard using an alternative transition method. Effectively, the alternative transition method permits adoption of the Lease Standard through an adjustment to its opening balance sheet for the period of adoption, with the cumulative effect accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings, without restating prior periods. ​The Company adopted the Lease Standard on March 3, 2019 under the alternative transition method as permissible under ASU 2018-11, and applied the Lease Standard to all leases through a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit. As a result, comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the Lease Standard, which includes, among other things, the ability to carry forward the existing lease classification.  On March 3, 2019, the Company recorded a liability for operating leases of $3,295,327, a ROU asset for such leases of $3,026,976 and recorded an after-tax transition adjustment to increase accumulated deficit by $56,776. The Lease Standard had a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, but did not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations or the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.​14
Table of ContentsRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES​NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS​For the Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Week Periods Ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018​(Dollars and share information in thousands, except per share amounts)​(unaudited)​As permitted under the practical expedient concerning assessment of lease portfolio, the Company chose not to reassess its lease portfolio, and consequently, all existing leases that were classified as operating leases in accordance with Topic 840, continue to be classified as operating leases, and all existing leases that were classified as capital leases under Topic 840 continue to be classified as finance leases.​The Company performed an evaluation of ROU asset for impairment on transition. Stores that had previously been impaired and continued to fail the recoverability test as of March 2, 2019 were evaluated. Any store ROU asset with a carrying amount in excess of fair value was written down to the fair value. Fair value of those ROU assets was determined based on a study of market rents for similar active/operating retails sites. The result of this impairment assessment was a $81,745 write-down of the ROU assets on transition to accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company recognized $24,969 of deferred gains as a reduction to accumulated deficit upon transition related to prior sale-leaseback transactions along with other minor adjustments.​As of March 2, 2019, the Company had $124,046 in closed store and lease exit liabilities under Topic 420 (“Topic 420 Liabilities”). Under transition to Topic 842, existing Topic 420 liabilities were eliminated by recording a reduction to the ROU asset balance. However, in certain cases the Company had larger existing Topic 420 liabilities than the ROU asset balances. This excess amount of $9,333 continues to be recorded as a liability and will reduce lease expense over the remaining lease term of the affected stores. In addition, upon transition, the Company reclassified deferred rent, including unamortized tenant income allowances, prepaid rent, and favorable and unfavorable lease balances resulting from prior acquisition accounting to the ROU asset.​The following is a discussion of the Company’s lease policy under the new lease accounting standard:​The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term.  We use quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions in an input to derive our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease.  The ROU asset is equal to the operating lease liability plus lease payments made before commencement, less lease incentives received from the landlord.​The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit lease extensions for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, generally, the renewal periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and operating lease liability as the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain to occur at lease commencement. The Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and will include all reasonably certain options in the measurement of our lease term. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the operating lease right-of-use asset and the operating lease liability until the renewals are i) evaluated and ii) determined to be exercised. The Company has an insignificant amount of non-real estate leases however, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-15

The Company rarely executes leases less than 12 months. On transition, the Company did include in its ROU asset balance leases with less than 12 months remaining.  ​For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities.​16

ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and 17
Table of ContentsRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES​NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS​For the Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Week Periods Ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018​(Dollars and share information in thousands, except per share amounts)​(unaudited)​supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net), which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which amends the guidance in those areas in the new revenue recognition standard. These ASUs, collectively the “new revenue standard“, are effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning January 1, 2018.​The Company adopted the new revenue standard as of March 4, 2018 using the modified retrospective method and applying the new standard to all contracts with customers. In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, the Company identified one difference in its Retail Pharmacy segment related to the timing of revenue recognition for third party prescription revenues, which was historically recognized at the time the prescription was filled. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, this revenue is recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. In connection with its March 4, 2018 adoption of the new revenue standard on a modified retrospective basis, the Company recorded a reduction to accounts receivable of $57,897, a reduction to deferred tax assets of $1,771, an increase to inventory of $51,121, and a corresponding increase to accumulated deficit of $8,547 within its Retail Pharmacy segment. ​In addition, the Company identified revenues under one specific rebate administration program under which the Company's Pharmacy Services segment was determined to be the principal and historically recognized revenues and cost of revenues on a gross basis of approximately $123,500 during fiscal 2018. Upon adoption of the new revenue standard, the Company is now recording revenue from this program on a net basis.​The following is a discussion of the Company's revenue recognition policies by segment under the new revenue recognition accounting standard:​Revenue Recognition​Retail Pharmacy Segment​For front-end sales, the Retail Pharmacy segment recognizes revenues upon the transfer of control of the goods to the customer. The Company satisfies its performance obligation at the point of sale for front-end transactions. The Retail Pharmacy segment front-end revenue is measured based on the amount of fixed consideration that it expects to receive, net of an allowance for estimated future returns. Return activity is immaterial to revenues and results of operations in all periods presented. ​For pharmacy sales, the Retail Pharmacy segment recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of the goods to the customer. The Company satisfies its performance obligation, upon pickup by the customer, which is when the customer takes title to the product.  Each prescription claim represents an individual arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims.  The Company’s revenue is measured based on the amount of fixed consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by refunds owed to the third party payor for pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not highly subjective or volatile. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual amounts have not been material to the Company’s results of operations or financial position. Prescriptions are generally not returnable.​18
Table of ContentsRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES​NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS​For the Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Week Periods Ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018​(Dollars and share information in thousands, except per share amounts)​(unaudited)​The Retail Pharmacy segment offers a chain-wide loyalty card program titled wellness +. Individual customers are able to become members of the wellness + program.  Members participating in the wellness + loyalty card program earn points on a calendar year basis for eligible front-end merchandise purchases and qualifying prescription purchases. One point is awarded for each dollar spent towards front-end merchandise and 25 points are awarded for each qualifying prescription.​Effective January 1, 2020, members reach specific wellness + tiers based on points accumulated during the six calendar month periods between January 1st and June 30th, and July 1st through December 31st, which entitles such customers to certain future discounts and other benefits upon reaching that tier.  For example, any customer that reaches 500 points during the six calendar month period between January 1st and June 30th achieves the “Gold” tier, enabling him or her to receive a 20% discount on qualifying purchases of front-end merchandise for the remaining portion of that six calendar month period and for the following six calendar months.  There is also a similar “Silver” level with a lower threshold and benefit level.  Prior to January 1, 2020, the wellness + tiers were based on points accumulated for a full calendar year, and entitled such customers to wellness + benefits for the remainder of that calendar year and also the next calendar year.​Points earned pursuant to the wellness+ program represent a performance obligation and the Company allocates revenue between the merchandise purchased and the wellness + points based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. The relative value of the wellness + points is initially deferred as a contract liability (included in other current and noncurrent liabilities). As members receive discounted front-end merchandise or when the benefit period expires, the Retail Pharmacy segment recognizes an allocable portion of the deferred contract liability into revenue. The Retail Pharmacy segment had accrued contract liabilities of $67,517 as of November 30, 2019, of which $62,339 is included in other current liabilities and $5,178 is included in noncurrent liabilities. The Retail Pharmacy segment had accrued contract liabilities of $63,720 as of March 2, 2019, of which $51,042 is included in other current liabilities and $12,678 is included in noncurrent liabilities.​Pharmacy Services Segment​The Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs indirectly through its retail pharmacy network and directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacy. The Pharmacy Services segment recognizes revenue from prescription drugs sold by (i) its mail service dispensing pharmacy and (ii) under retail pharmacy network contracts where it is the principal at the contract prices negotiated with its clients, primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. Revenues include: (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Pharmacy Services segment, net of any volume-related or other discounts paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” below), (ii) the price paid to the Pharmacy Services segment by client plan members for mail order prescriptions (“Mail Co-Payments”), (iii) client plan member copayments made directly to the retail pharmacy network and (iv) administrative fees. Revenue is recognized when the Pharmacy Services segment meets its performance obligations relative to each transaction type. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Pharmacy Services segment:​●Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Pharmacy Services segment’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Pharmacy Services segment’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Pharmacy Services 19
Table of ContentsRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES​NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS​For the Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Week Periods Ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018​(Dollars and share information in thousands, except per share amounts)​(unaudited)​segment’s online claims processing system.  At this point the Company has performed all of its performance obligations.​●Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by the Pharmacy Services segment’s mail service dispensing pharmacy are recognized when the prescription is shipped. At the time of shipment, the Pharmacy Services segment has performed all of its performance obligations under its client contracts, as control of and title to the product has passed to the client plan members.  The Pharmacy Services segment does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.​●Revenues generated from administrative fees based on membership or claims volume are recognized monthly based on the terms within the individual contracts, either a monthly member based fee, or a claims volume based fee.​In the majority of its contracts, the Pharmacy Services segment is the principal because its client contracts give clients the right to obtain access to its pharmacy contracts under which the Pharmacy Services segment directs its pharmacy network to provide the services (drug dispensing, consultation, etc.) and goods (prescription drugs) to the clients’ members at its negotiated pricing. The Pharmacy Services segment’s obligations under its client contracts are separate and distinct from its obligations to the third party pharmacies included in its retail pharmacy network contracts. In the majority of these contracts, the Pharmacy Services segment is contractually required to pay the third party pharmacies in its retail pharmacy network for products sold after payment is received from its clients. The Pharmacy Services segment has control over these transactions until the prescription is transferred to the member and, thus, that it is acting as a principal. As such, the Pharmacy Services segment records the total prescription price contracted with clients in revenues.​Amounts paid to pharmacies and amounts charged to clients are exclusive of the applicable co-payment under Pharmacy Services segment contracts. Retail pharmacy co-payments, which we instruct retail pharmacies to collect from members, are included in our revenues and our cost of revenues.​For contracts under which the Pharmacy Services segment acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client, no revenue is recognized, except the administrative fee.​Drug Discounts—The Pharmacy Services segment deducts from its revenues that are generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies any rebates, inclusive of discounts and fees, earned by its clients based on utilization levels and other factors as negotiated with the prescription drug manufacturers or suppliers. Rebates are paid to clients in accordance with the terms of client contracts.​Medicare Part D—The Pharmacy Services segment, through its Envision Insurance Company ("EIC") subsidiary, participates in the federal government’s Medicare Part D program as a Prescription Drug Plan (“PDP”). Please refer to Note 8, Medicare Part D.​20

Under ASU 2016-13, an entity will recognize, as an allowance, its estimate of lifetime expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses.  ASU 2016-13 impacts non-banks as most non-banks have financial instruments or other assets (e.g. trade, contract and lease receivables, financial guarantees, loans and loan commitments and held-to-maturity debt securities).  The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting ASU 2016-13, but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.​Reclassification of the Statements of Cash Flows presentation​During fiscal 2019, the Company expanded its disclosure on its Statements of Cash Flows to include changes in other assets separate from changes in other liabilities, which had historically been combined. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.​Recasting of per-share amounts​The Company implemented a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a reverse stock split ratio of 1-for-20. The Company’s common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on the NYSE at the market open on April 22, 2019. Accordingly, all share and per-share amounts for the prior period has been recasted to reflect the reverse stock split.​​​21

Restructuring​In March 2019, the Board of Directors implemented a reorganization of our executive management team to further streamline our business.  In addition, the Company announced a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of managerial layers and consolidated roles across the organization.

The impact of the sale of the distribution center and related assets resulted in a pre-tax gain of $14,151, which has been included in the results of operations and cash flows of discontinued operations during the fifty-two week period ended March 2, 2019. ​On October 31, 2019, the Company completed the inventory transfer at one of its remaining distribution centers to WBA for proceeds of $23,542.  The inventory was transferred to WBA at cost, and as such, did not result in any gain or loss.  The inventory transfer has been included in the results of operations and cash flows of discontinued operations for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019.  On December 4, 2019, the Company completed the transfer of the related distribution center and non-inventory related assets to WBA for proceeds of $39,232. The impact of the sale of the related distribution center and non-inventory assets resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $19,000, which will be included in the results of operations and cash flows of discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.​The transfer of the remaining distribution center and related assets remains subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the distribution center being transferred at such distribution center closing, as specified in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement.​The parties to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement have each made customary representations and warranties. The Company has agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among others, the Company’s agreement to conduct its business at the distribution centers being sold to WBA in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement and the distribution center closing. The Company has also agreed to provide transition services to Buyer for up to three years after the initial closing of the Sale. Under the terms of the TSA, the Company provides various services on behalf of WBA, including but not limited to the purchase and distribution of inventory and virtually all selling, general and administrative activities. The term of the TSA has been extended to October 17, 2020. In connection with these services, the Company purchases the related inventory and incurs cash payments for the selling, general and administrative activities, which, the Company bills on a cash neutral basis to WBA in accordance with terms as outlined in the TSA. Total billings for these items during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 were $619,680 and $2,726,436, respectively, of which $105,431 is included in Accounts receivable, net. Total billings for these items during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018 were $1,587,824 and $5,464,383, respectively, of which $327,869 is included in Accounts receivable, net. The Company recorded WBA TSA fees of $7,870 and $33,403 during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019, respectively, which are reflected as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company recorded WBA TSA fees of $17,900 and $64,848 during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018, respectively, which are reflected as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses.​Based on its magnitude and because the Company exited certain markets, the Sale represented a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Accordingly, the Company has applied discontinued operations treatment for the Sale as required by Accounting Standards Codification 210-05-Discontinued Operations (ASC 205-20). In accordance with ASC 205-20, the Company reclassified the Disposal Group to assets and liabilities held for sale on its consolidated balance sheets as of the periods ended November 30, 2019 and March 2, 2019, and reclassified the financial results of the Disposal Group in its consolidated statements of operations 24

Income (Loss) Per Share​Basic loss per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income of the Company, subject to anti-dilution limitations.​​Due to their antidilutive effect, 820 and 1,085 potential common shares related to stock options have been excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the thirteen week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. Due to their antidilutive effect, 1,431 and 1,085 potential common shares related to stock options have been excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the thirty-nine 26

Also, excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the thirteen week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 are restricted shares of 0 and 337, respectively, which are included in shares outstanding. Excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 are restricted shares of 1,481 and 337, respectively, which are included in shares outstanding. ​On April 10, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a one-for-twenty reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was effected on April 18, 2019 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. At the effective time, every twenty issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock were converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split, and in lieu thereof, each stockholder holding fractional shares was entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest or deduction) from the Company’s transfer agent in an amount equal to such stockholder’s respective pro rata shares of the total net proceeds from the Company’s transfer agent sale of all fractional shares at the then-prevailing prices on the open market. In connection with the reverse stock split, the number of authorized shares of our common stock was also reduced on a one-for-twenty basis, from 1,500,000 to 75,000. The par value of each share of common stock remained unchanged. A proportionate adjustment was also made to the maximum number of shares issuable under the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.​5. Lease Termination and Impairment Charges​Lease termination and impairment charges consist of amounts as follows:​​Impairment Charges​These amounts include the write-down of long-lived assets at locations that were assessed for impairment because of management’s intention to relocate or close the location or because of changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.​The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following:​●Level 1—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.​27
Table of ContentsRITE AID CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES​NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS​For the Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Week Periods Ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018​(Dollars and share information in thousands, except per share amounts)​(unaudited)​●Level 2—Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument.​●Level 3—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management’s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.​Non-Financial Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis​Long-lived non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for purposes of calculating impairment using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 2 inputs is determined by evaluating the current economic conditions in the geographic area for similar use assets. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 3 inputs is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows (which are unobservable inputs) and discounting them using a risk-adjusted rate of interest (which is Level 1). The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located. Significant increases or decreases in actual cash flows may result in valuation changes. During the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019, long-lived assets from continuing operations with a carrying value of $1,533, primarily store assets, were written down to their fair value of $0, resulting in an impairment charge of $1,533 of which $121 relates to the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019. During the thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018, long-lived assets from continuing operations with a carrying value of $41,755, primarily store assets, were written down to their fair value of $7,183, resulting in an impairment charge of $34,572 of which $727 relates to the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018. If our actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially, certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods.​The following table presents fair values for those assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fair Values​Total​​​​​​​​as of ​Charges​    Level 1    Level 2    Level 3    Impairment Date    November 30, 2019Long-lived assets held for use​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ (1,533)Long-lived assets held for sale​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —Total​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ (1,533)​​The above assets reflected in the caption Long-lived assets held for sale are separate and apart from the Assets to be Sold and due to their immateriality have not been reclassified to assets held for sale.28

Decisions to close or relocate stores or distribution centers in future periods would result in lease termination charges, lease exit costs and inventory liquidation charges, as well as impairment of assets at these locations. When a store or distribution center is closed, the Company records an expense for unrecoverable costs and accrues a liability equal to the present value at current credit adjusted risk-free interest rates of any anticipated executory costs which are not included within the store or distribution center's respective lease liability under Topic 842. Other store or distribution center closing and liquidation costs are expensed when incurred.​The following table reflects the closed store and distribution center charges that relate to new closures, changes in assumptions and interest accretion:​​​6. Fair Value Measurements​The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy as described in Note 5, Lease Termination and Impairment Charges, for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements.​As of November 30, 2019 and March 2, 2019, the Company did not have any financial assets measured on a recurring basis.​Other Financial Instruments​Financial instruments other than long-term indebtedness include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. These instruments are recorded at book value, which we believe approximate their fair values due 29

In addition, as of November 30, 2019, the Company has $7,039 of investments carried at amortized cost as these investments are being held to maturity, which are included as a component of other assets. As of March 2, 2019, the Company has $7,191 of investments carried at amortized cost as these investments are being held to maturity, which are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Company believes the carrying value of these investments approximates their fair value.​The fair value for LIBOR-based borrowings under the Company’s senior secured credit facility is estimated based on the quoted market price of the financial instrument which is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of substantially all of the Company’s other long-term indebtedness are estimated based on quoted market prices of the financial instruments which are considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company’s total long-term indebtedness was $3,566,261 and $3,204,496, respectively, as of November 30, 2019. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company's total long-term indebtedness was $3,454,585 and $3,120,335, respectively, as of March 2, 2019.​On March 15, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate cap (“Cap”), which has been designated to the variable interest rate payments on the first $650.0 million notional amount of variable rate indebtedness. The Cap has an effective date of March 21, 2019 and expires on March 21, 2021. The Cap provides the Company with interest rate protection in the event that LIBOR increases above 2.75%.  The nominal fair market value of the Cap is recorded as a component of other assets.​7. Income Taxes​The Company recorded an income tax expense from continuing operations of $876 and an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $1,471 for the thirteen week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 respectively, and an income tax expense from continuing operations of $35,878 and an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $117,527 for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the thirteen week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 was 1.6% and 7.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 was (39.9)% and 22.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 was net of an adjustment of (31.8)% and (61.0)%, respectively, to adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets created this year as well as for certain existing state deferred taxes whose realization is now uncertain due to a restructuring of our legal entities. The effective tax rate for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018 included an adjustment of (9.5)% and (4.1)% to increase the valuation allowance related to certain state deferred taxes.​The Company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for uncertain tax positions and management adjusts these liabilities with changes in judgment as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.​The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $7,448 in unrecognized tax benefits related to state exposures may be necessary in the next twelve months however management does not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.​30

Management will continue to monitor all available evidence related to the net deferred tax assets that may change the most recent assessment, including events that have occurred or are anticipated to occur. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $1,071,001 and $1,091,416, which relates to federal and state deferred tax assets that may not be realized based on the Company's future projections of taxable income at November 30, 2019 and March 2, 2019, respectively.​8. Medicare Part D​The Company offers Medicare Part D benefits through EIC, which has contracted with CMS to be a PDP and, pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, must be a risk-bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws or similar statutes.​EIC is a licensed domestic insurance company under the applicable laws and regulations. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, EIC must file quarterly and annual reports with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and certain state regulators, must maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus under formulas established by certain states and must, in certain circumstances, request and receive the approval of certain state regulators before making dividend payments or other capital distributions to the Company. The Company does not believe these limitations on dividends and distributions materially impact its financial position.  EIC is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements in certain states.  The minimum amount of capital and surplus required to satisfy regulatory requirements in these states is $25,332 as of September 30, 2019. EIC was in excess of the minimum required amounts in these states as of November 30, 2019. ​The Company has recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from its participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in its claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from its participation in this program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidies, reinsurance amounts, and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in the following year; (ii) an estimate of amounts receivable from CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported.​As of November 30, 2019 and March 2, 2019, accounts receivable, net included $374,736 and $392,400 due from CMS respectively.​9.

The Company’s new Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 to 175 basis points (or an alternate base rate plus 25 to 75 basis points), depending on availability under the revolving facility.  The Company’s new Senior Secured Term Loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300 basis points (or an alternate base rate plus 200 basis points).33

At November 30, 2019, the Company had $1,585,000 of borrowings outstanding under the New Facilities and had letters of credit outstanding against the New Facilities of $83,195 which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of $1,481,805.​The New Facilities restrict the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein) from accumulating cash on hand in excess of $200,000 at any time revolving loans are outstanding (not including cash located in its stores and lockbox deposit account and cash necessary to cover current liabilities).​The New Facilities allow the Company to have outstanding, at any time, up to $1,500,000 in secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock in addition to borrowings under the New Facilities and existing indebtedness, provided that not in excess of $750,000 of such secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to 90 days after the latest of (i) the fifth anniversary of the effectiveness of the New Facilities and (ii) the latest maturity date of any Term Loan or Other Revolving Commitment (each as defined in the New Facilities). Subject to the limitations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the New Facilities additionally allow the Company to issue or incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock so long as a Financial Covenant Effectiveness Period (as defined in the New Facilities) is not in effect; provided, however, that certain of the Company’s other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence or other exemptions are not available. The New Facilities also contain certain restrictions on the amount of secured first priority debt the Company is able to incur. The New Facilities also allow for the voluntary repurchase of any debt or other convertible debt, so long as the New Facilities are not in default and the Company maintains availability under its revolver of more than $365,000.​The New Facilities have a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (i) on any date on which availability under the revolver is less than $200,000 or (ii) on the third consecutive business day on which availability under the revolver is less than $250,000 and, in each case, ending on and excluding the first day thereafter, if any, which is the 30th consecutive calendar day on which availability under the New Facilities is equal to or greater than $250,000. As of November 30, 2019, the Company had availability under its New Facilities of $1,481,805, its fixed charge coverage ratio was greater than 1.00 to 1.00, and the Company was in compliance with the New Facilities' financial covenant. The New Facilities also contain covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt, the payments of dividends, sale of assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens.​The New Facilities also provide for customary events of default.​With the exception of EIC, substantially all of Rite Aid Corporation’s 100 % owned subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the New Facilities and unsecured guaranteed notes. The New Facilities are secured, on a senior priority basis, by a lien on, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files of the Subsidiary Guarantors.

Segment Reporting ​The Company has two reportable segments, its retail drug stores (“Retail Pharmacy”), and its pharmacy services (“Pharmacy Services”) segments.​The Retail Pharmacy segment’s primary business is the sale of prescription drugs and related consultation to its customers.  Additionally, the Retail Pharmacy segment sells a full selection of health and beauty aids and personal care products, seasonal merchandise and a large private brand product line. The Pharmacy Services segment offers a full range of pharmacy benefit management services including plan design and administration, on both a transparent pass-through model and traditional model, formulary management and claims processing.

The CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions. The CODM determines, in particular, resource allocation for, and monitors performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Retail Pharmacy segment and the Pharmacy Services segment. The Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segment managers have responsibility for operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance within their respective segments.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees​Legal Matters and Regulatory Proceedings​The Company is involved in numerous legal matters including litigation, arbitration, and other claims, and is subject to regulatory proceedings including investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries, and similar actions by pharmacy, health care, tax and other governmental authorities arising in the ordinary course of its business, including, without limitation, the matters described below.  The Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters and applicable regulatory proceedings when it believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters and regulatory proceedings that could affect the amount of any existing accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency 43

If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability.  None of the Company’s accruals for outstanding legal matters or regulatory proceedings are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s consolidated financial position.​The Company’s contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including, among other factors: (i) proceedings are in early stages; (ii) whether class or collective action status is sought and the likelihood of a class being certified; (iii) the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (iv) the extent of potential damages, fines or penalties, which are often unspecified or indeterminate; (v) the impact of discovery on the matter; (vi) whether novel or unsettled legal theories are at issue; (vii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (viii) in the case of certain government agency investigations, whether a qui tam lawsuit (“whistleblower” action) has been filed and whether the government agency makes a decision to intervene in the lawsuit following investigation.  While the Company cannot predict the outcome of any of the contingencies, the Company’s management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters or regulatory proceedings will be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.  It is possible, however, the Company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected by unfavorable outcomes in outstanding legal matters or regulatory proceedings.​California Employment Litigation.​The Company is currently a defendant in several lawsuits filed in courts in California alleging violations of California Business and Professions Code, industry wage orders, wage-and-hour laws, rules and regulations pertaining primarily to failure to pay overtime, failure to pay premiums for missed meals and rest periods, failure to provide accurate wage statements, and failure to reimburse business expenses (the “California Cases”).  Some of the California Cases purport or may be determined to be class actions or PAGA representative actions and seek substantial damages and penalties.  The single-plaintiff and multi-plaintiff California Cases regarding violations of wage-and-hour laws, failure to pay overtime, failure to pay premiums for missed meals and rest periods, failure to provide accurate wage statements, and failure to reimburse business expenses, in the aggregate, seek substantial damages. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in the California Cases, as well as other lawsuits, have merit.  The Company has aggressively challenged the merits of the lawsuits and, where applicable, the allegations that the lawsuits should be certified as class or representative actions.  Additionally, at this time the Company is not able to predict either the outcome of or estimate a potential range of loss with respect to the California Cases and is defending itself against these claims.​Usual and Customary and DUR/Code 1 Litigation.​In January 2017, qui tam plaintiff Azam Rahimi (“Relator”) filed a sealed False Claims Act (“FCA”) lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, 18 states, and the District of Columbia declined to intervene.  The unsealed lawsuit alleges that the Company failed to report Rite Aid’s Rx Savings Program prices as its usual and customary charges under the Medicare Part D program, federal and state Medicaid programs, and other publicly funded health care programs, and that the Company is thus liable under the federal FCA and similar state statutes.  On July 31, 2019, the Company filed a motion to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings based on the FCA’s public disclosure bar.  On December 12, 2019, the court granted the Company’s motion.  Relator has until December 26, 2019 by which to file a motion for reconsideration or January 13, 2020 by which to file a notice of appeal.

At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is not able to either predict the outcome of this lawsuit or estimate a potential range of loss with respect to the lawsuit, and is defending itself against these claims.​The Company is involved in two putative consumer class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California captioned Byron Stafford v. Rite Aid Corp., Case No. 17-CV-01340-AJB-JLB (June 30, 2017) and Robert Josten v. Rite Aid Corp., Case No. 18-CV-00152-AJB-JLB (January 23, 2018).  The lawsuits allege that (i) the Company was obligated to charge the plaintiffs’ insurance companies a “usual and customary” price for their prescription drugs; and (ii) the Company failed to do so properly because the prices it reported were not equal to or adjusted to account for the prices that Rite Aid offers to uninsured and underinsured customers through its Rx Savings Program.  Both lawsuits were consolidated under the Stafford caption on November 12, 2019.  At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is not able to either predict the outcome of the consolidated lawsuit or estimate a potential range of loss with respect to the lawsuit, and is defending itself against these claims.​In June 2013, the Company was served with a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California (the “USAO”) regarding (1) the Company’s Drug Utilization Review (“DUR”) and prescription dispensing protocol; and (2) the dispensing of drugs designated as “Code 1” by the State of California.  The Company cooperated with the investigation, researched the government’s allegations, and refuted the government’s position.  The Company produced documents including certain prescription files related to Code 1 drugs to the USAO’s office and the State of California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Medical Fraud and Elder Abuse (“CADOJ”).  In August 2014, the USAO and 8 states’ attorneys general declined to intervene in a California False Claim Act lawsuit filed under seal in the Eastern District of California by qui tam plaintiff Loyd F. Schmuckley (“Relator”) based on DUR and Code 1 allegations.  In July 2016, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia also declined to intervene in the lawsuit.  At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is not able to either predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a potential range of loss with respect to this matter, and is defending itself against these claims.​Pseudoephedrine Investigation.​On April 26, 2012, the Company was served with an administrative subpoena from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), Albany, New York District Office, requesting information regarding the Company’s sale of products containing pseudoephedrine (“PSE”).  In April 2012, it also received a communication from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York (“USAO”) regarding an investigation of possible civil violations of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (“CMEA”).  Additional subpoenas were served in 2013, 2014, and 2015 requesting broader documentation regarding PSE sales and recordkeeping requirements.  The Company has cooperated, provided information and documents responsive to the subpoenas and supplemental requests for production.  The civil investigation is ongoing.       ​45

In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated and transferred hundreds of federal opioid-related lawsuits that name the Company and/or a related entity as a defendant to the multi-district litigation (“MDL”) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio before Judge Dan Polster under In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (Case No. 17-MD-2804).  A significant number of similar cases that are not part of the MDL and name the Company and/or a related entity as a defendant in some capacity are also pending in state courts.  The plaintiffs in all of these opioid-related lawsuits generally allege claims concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse against defendants along the pharmaceutical supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and retail pharmacies.  At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is not able to predict the outcome of the opioid-related lawsuits or estimate a potential range of loss regarding the lawsuits.  The Company is defending itself against all such claims.  ​The Company also has received warrants, subpoenas, CIDs, and other requests for documents and information from, and is being investigated by, the federal government and/or the Attorneys General of several states regarding opioids.  The Company has been providing documents and information in response to these warrants, subpoenas, CIDs, and other requests for information.​Miscellaneous Litigation and Investigations.​In addition to the above described matters, the Company is subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. While the Company’s management cannot predict the outcome of any of the claims, the Company’s management does not believe that the outcome of any of these matters will be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position.  It is possible, however, that the Company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of pending litigation or contingencies.​These other legal proceedings include claims of improper disclosure of personal information, anticompetitive practices, general contractual matters, product liability, professional malpractice, non-compliance with state and federal regulatory regimes, marketing misconduct, intellectual property litigation and employment litigation.  Some of these other legal proceedings are or are purported to be class actions or derivative claims.  The Company is defending itself against the claims brought in these matters.  ​17.

Table of ContentsITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations​Overview​We are a pharmacy retail healthcare company, providing our customers and communities with a high level of care and service through various programs we offer through our two reportable business segments, our Retail Pharmacy segment and our Pharmacy Services segment. We accomplish our goal of delivering comprehensive care to our customers through our retail drugstores, RediClinic walk-in retail health clinics and our transparent and traditional PBMs, EnvisionRxOptions and MedTrak. We also offer fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services through EnvisionPharmacies. Additionally through EIC, EnvisionRxOptions also serves one of the fastest-growing demographics in healthcare: seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. When combined with our retail platform, this comprehensive suite of services allows us to provide value and choice to customers, patients and payors and allows us to compete in today's evolving healthcare marketplace.​Retail Pharmacy Segment​Our Retail Pharmacy segment sells brand and generic prescription drugs, as well as an assortment of front-end products including health and beauty aids, personal care products, seasonal merchandise, and a large private brand product line. Our Retail Pharmacy segment generates the majority of its revenue through the sale of prescription drugs and front-end products at our 2,464 retail stores. We replenish our retail stores through a combination of direct store delivery of pharmaceutical products facilitated through our pharmaceutical Purchasing and Delivery Agreement with McKesson, and the majority of our front-end products through our network of distribution centers. In addition, as of November 30, 2019, the Retail Pharmacy segment includes 66 RediClinic walk-in retail clinics, of which, 30 were located within Rite Aid retail stores in the Philadelphia and New Jersey markets.​Pharmacy Services Segment​Our Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit services through EnvisionRxOptions. The Pharmacy Services segment provides both transparent and traditional PBM options through its EnvisionRxOptions and MedTrak PBMs. EnvisionRxOptions also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services through EnvisionPharmacies; an innovative claims adjudication software platform in Laker Software; and a national Medicare Part D prescription drug plan through EIC’s EnvisionRx Plus product offering. The segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States.​Restructuring​In March 2019, the Board of Directors implemented a reorganization of our executive management team to further streamline our business. In addition, we announced a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of managerial layers and consolidated roles across the organization. In addition, we have been working on other transformation initiatives, which include building tools to work with regional health plans to improve patient health outcomes, rationalization of SKU’s in our front-end offering to free up working capital, an assessment of our pricing and promotional strategy, additional executive team changes and further headcount reductions, and a continued review of our cost structure.​As a result of the restructuring that we announced in March, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $55.0 million, of which approximately $42.0 million is expected to be realized during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. These savings offset the reduction in TSA fees that we experienced in Fiscal 2020. We have also incurred restructuring costs to support our transformation initiatives, which we expect to provide future growth and expense efficiency benefits. We anticipate our total fiscal 2020 restructuring-related costs to be approximately $100.0 million and expect to realize the full benefit of this investment over the next two years.​57

Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer agreed to purchase from Rite Aid 1,932 Acquired Stores, three distribution centers, related inventory and other specified assets and liabilities related thereto for a purchase price of approximately $4.375 billion, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, in the Sale.​We announced on September 19, 2017 that the waiting period under the HSR Act expired with respect to the Sale.  We completed the store transfer process in March of 2018, which resulted in the transfer of all 1,932 stores and related assets to WBA and received cash proceeds of $4.157 billion.  On September 13, 2018, we completed the sale of one of our distribution centers and related assets to WBA for proceeds of $61.2 million. On October 31, 2019, we completed the inventory transfer at one of our remaining distribution centers to WBA for proceeds of $23.5 million. The inventory transfer has been included in the results of operations and cash flows of discontinued operations for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019.  On December 4, 2019, we completed the transfer of the related distribution center and non-inventory related assets to WBA for proceeds of $39.2 million. The impact of the sale of the related distribution center and non-inventory assets resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $19.0 million, which will be included in the results of operations and cash flows of discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. ​The transfer of the remaining distribution center and related assets remains subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the distribution center being transferred at such distribution center closing, as specified in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. We will receive additional proceeds of approximately $94.0 million upon completion of the sale of the remaining distribution center and related assets.​The parties to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement have each made customary representations and warranties. We have agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among others, our agreement to conduct our business at the distribution centers being sold to WBA in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement and the distribution center closing. We have also agreed to provide transition services to Buyer for up to three years after the initial closing of the Sale. Under the terms of the TSA, we provide various services on behalf of WBA, including but not limited to the purchase and distribution of inventory and virtually all selling, general and administrative activities. The term of the TSA has been extended to October 17, 2020. In connection with these services, we purchase the related inventory and incur cash payments for the selling, general and administrative activities, which, we bill on a cash neutral basis to WBA in accordance with terms as outlined in the TSA. Total billings for these items during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 were $0.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, of which $105.4 million is included in Accounts receivable, net. Total billings for these items during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018 were $1.6 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of which $327.9 million is included in Accounts receivable, net. We recorded WBA TSA fees of $7.9 million and $33.4 million during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019, respectively, which are reflected as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. We recorded WBA TSA fees of $17.9 million and $64.8 million during the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018, respectively, which are reflected as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses.​Based on its magnitude and because we exited certain markets, the Sale represented a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, we have applied discontinued operations treatment for the Sale as required by GAAP.​Overview of Financial Results from Continuing Operations​Our net income from continuing operations for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was $52.3 million or $0.98 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $17.3 million or $0.33 per basic and diluted share for the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018. The improvement in our operating results for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was due primarily to the $55.7 million gain on debt retirement in connection with the 58
Table of Contentsrepurchase of $57.6 million of our 7.7% notes due February 2027 and $99.0 million of our 6.875% fixed-rate senior notes due December 2028 at a discount and lower SG&A expenses resulting from lower labor and benefits expense, partially offset by a reduction in WBA TSA fee income and restructuring-related costs incurred in connection with our Path to the Future initiative in the current year.​Our net loss from continuing operations for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 was $125.8 million or $2.37 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $411.3 million or $7.79 per basic and diluted share for the thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018. The improvement in our operating results for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 was due primarily to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized in the prior year of $375.2 million, the gain on debt retirement noted above, lower labor and benefits expense, lower depreciation and amortization and lease termination and impairment charges. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring-related costs incurred in connection with our Path to the Future initiative in the current year and higher income tax expense and lower WBA TSA fee income.​Our Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 was $158.1 million or 2.9 percent of revenues and $402.6 million or 2.5 percent of revenues, respectively, compared to $142.8 million or 2.6 percent of revenues and $429.4 million or 2.6 percent of revenues for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018, respectively.  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was due to increases in both the Retail Pharmacy segment and the Pharmacy Services segment. Adjusted EBITDA increased $7.4 million in the Retail Pharmacy segment due primarily to lower salaries and benefit expense related to our previously announced corporate restructuring and strong labor, benefits and other expense control at the stores, partially offset by lower gross profit. In addition, there was a reduction in WBA TSA fee income due to fewer stores being serviced under the TSA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $7.9 million in the Pharmacy Services segment. Pharmacy Services segment Adjusted EBITDA benefited from improvements in pharmacy network performance, partially offset by increases in SG&A expense related to our growth in Medicare Part D membership. ​The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 was due primarily to a decrease of $23.7 million in the Retail Pharmacy segment. The decrease in the Retail Pharmacy segment Adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to a reduction in gross profit, partially offset by decreases in SG&A. The reduction in gross profit was due primarily to a reduction in front-end sales and lower reimbursement rates. Retail Pharmacy segment SG&A improvement was driven by strong labor and expense control at the stores and labor savings and expense management relating to the recent corporate restructuring. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $3.0 million in the Pharmacy Services segment.  The decline in the Pharmacy Services segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of increased commissions due to growth in Medicare Part D membership and growth in consumer pharmacy programs.

See the Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the adoption of this new lease standard.​Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations—Lease Termination and Impairment Charges” included in our Fiscal 2019 10-K for a detailed description of our impairment and lease termination methodology for fiscal 2019.​Interest Expense​Interest expense was $57.9 million and $176.2 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019, respectively, compared to $56.0 million and $175.0 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our indebtedness for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 was 5.1% and 6.3%, respectively.​Income Taxes​We recorded an income tax expense from continuing operations of $0.9 million and an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $1.5 million for the thirteen week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. We recorded an income tax expense from continuing operations of $35.9 million and an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $117.5 million for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the thirteen week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 was 1.6% and 7.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 was (39.9)% and 22.2%, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 was net of an adjustment of (31.8)% and (61.0)%, respectively, to adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets created this year as well as for certain existing state deferred taxes whose realization is now uncertain due to a restructuring of our legal entities.  The effective tax rate for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018 included an adjustment of (9.5)% and (4.1)% to increase the valuation allowance related to certain state deferred taxes.​We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for uncertain tax positions and management adjusts these liabilities with changes in judgment as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.​We believe that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $7.4 million in unrecognized tax benefits related to state exposures may be necessary in the next twelve months however management does not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.​We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. We will continue to monitor all available evidence related to the net deferred tax assets that may change the most recent assessment, including events that have occurred or are anticipated to occur. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $1,071.0 million and $1,091.4 million, which relates to federal and 62

The decrease in revenues for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was primarily a result of a decline in same store sales.​Pharmacy same store sales increased by 0.1% for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 compared to an increase of 3.1% in the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018. The increase in the current period is due to the 2.8% 30-day equivalent increase in same store prescription count, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates.​Front-end same store sales decreased 0.5% during the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 compared to a decrease of 1.5% during the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018. Front-end same store sales, excluding cigarettes and tobacco (including e-cigarettes and vape products which we discontinued), increased 1.0% during the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019, driven by strong results in core categories such as upper respiratory, beverages, pain care and vitamins.​Revenues decreased 1.4% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 2019 compared to a decrease of 0.4% for the thirty-nine weeks ended December 1, 2018.

Pharmacy gross profit was negatively impacted by lower reimbursement rates that was partially offset by generic cost savings and same store prescription count growth. A portion of the decline in reimbursement rates was caused by adjusting our estimate for retroactive rate adjustments expected from a state Medicaid agency and a reimbursement rate adjustment resulting from the finalization of a contract with one of our payors. Front-end gross profit declined from the prior year due to a decline in front-end sales, and a weak summer and back to school season.​Gross margin was 27.4% of sales for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 which was flat compared to 27.2% of sales for the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018.​Gross margin was 27.0% of sales for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 compared to 27.2% of sales for the thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018. The reduction in gross margin for the thirty-nine week period was due primarily to reimbursement rate declines that we were not able to offset with generic cost savings.​We use the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of inventory valuation, which is estimated on a quarterly basis and is finalized at year end when inflation rates and inventory levels are final. Therefore, LIFO costs for interim period financial statements are estimated. LIFO credits were $7.4 million for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 and LIFO charges were $7.6 million for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019, compared to LIFO 65
Table of Contentscharges of $6.0 million and $19.3 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018, respectively. The LIFO credit in the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was due to lower estimated inflation rates on pharmacy inventory.​Selling, General and Administrative Expenses​SG&A expenses decreased $18.4 million for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 due primarily to strong labor, benefits and other expense control at the stores, labor savings and expense management relating to the recent corporate restructuring and higher professional fees incurred in the prior year relating to the WBA and Albertsons transactions. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring-related expenses incurred in connection with our Path to the Future transformation initiative and a reduction in WBA TSA fees due to servicing fewer stores. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was flat compared to the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018 as the decrease in SG&A expenses as noted above was offset by a loss of revenue leverage, as revenues declined.​SG&A expenses decreased $35.6 million for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 due to strong labor and expense control at the stores, labor savings and expense management relating to the recent corporate restructuring, a prior year legal settlement and higher professional fees incurred in the prior year relating to the WBA and Albertsons transactions. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring-related expenses incurred in connection with our Path to the Future transformation initiative and a reduction in WBA TSA fees due to servicing fewer stores.

Gross profit for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 was $326.3 million as compared to gross profit of $311.3 million for the thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018. The increase in the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods gross profit for the segment is primarily due to improved pharmacy network management. ​Gross margin was 7.3% of sales for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 compared to 6.7% of sales for the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018. Gross margin was 6.9% of sales for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 compared to 6.7% of sales for the thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018. ​Selling, General and Administrative Expenses​Pharmacy Services segment selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirteen week period ended November 30, 2019 was $90.6 million as compared to $80.0 million for the thirteen week period ended December 1, 2018. Pharmacy Services segment selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019 was $272.7 million as compared to $253.2 million for the thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Pharmacy Services segment revenue was 5.7% and 5.5% for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. The increase in the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of increased commissions due to growth in Medicare Part D membership and growth in consumer pharmacy programs.​Liquidity and Capital Resources​General​We have two primary sources of liquidity: (i) cash provided by operating activities and (ii) borrowings under our New Facilities. Our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations, to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt and to fund capital expenditures. Total liquidity as of November 30, 2019 was $1,544.3 million, which consisted of revolver borrowing capacity of $1,481.8 million and invested cash of $62.5 million.​Credit Facilities​On December 20, 2018, we entered into a new senior secured credit agreement, consisting of a new $2.7 billion senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility”) and a new $450.0 million “first-in, last out” senior secured term loan facility (“Senior Secured Term Loan”) (collectively the “New Facilities”). Proceeds from the New Facilities were used to refinance our prior $2.7 billion Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility due January 2020 (the “Old Facility”, the New Facilities and the Old Facility are collectively referred to herein as the “Facilities”). The New Facilities extend our debt maturity profile and provide additional 67
Table of Contentsliquidity. The New Facilities mature in December 2023, subject to an earlier maturity on December 31, 2022 if we have not repaid or refinanced our existing 6.125% Notes prior to such date. It is our intention to repay or refinance our existing 6.125% Notes prior to the early maturity becoming effective. Our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 125 to 175 basis points (or an alternate base rate plus 25 to 75 basis points), depending on availability under the revolving facility. Our new Senior Secured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300 basis points (or an alternate base rate plus 200 basis points).​Our ability to borrow under our New Facilities is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files. At November 30, 2019, we had $1,585.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the New Facilities and had letters of credit outstanding against the New Facilities of $83.2 million, which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of $1,481.8 million. If at any time the total credit exposure outstanding under our New Facilities and the principal amount of our other senior obligations exceed the borrowing base, we are required to make certain other mandatory prepayments to eliminate such shortfall.​The New Facilities restrict us and all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the New Facilities and unsecured guaranteed notes (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) from accumulating cash on hand in excess of $200.0 million at any time when revolving loans are outstanding (not including cash located in our store and lockbox deposit accounts and cash necessary to cover our current liabilities). The New Facilities also state that if at any time (other than following the exercise of remedies or acceleration of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority debt) either (i) an event of default exists under our New Facilities or (ii) the sum of revolver availability under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and certain amounts held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than $275.0 million for three consecutive business days or less than or equal to $200.0 million on any day (a “cash sweep period”), the funds in our deposit accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the New Facilities, and then held as collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of our New Facilities.​The New Facilities allow us to have outstanding, at any time, up to $1.5 billion in secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock in addition to borrowings under the New Facilities and existing indebtedness, provided that not in excess of $750.0 million of such secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to 90 days after the latest of (i) the fifth anniversary of the effectiveness of the New Facilities and (ii) the latest maturity date of any Term Loan or Other Revolving Commitment (each as defined in the New Facilities). Subject to the limitations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the New Facilities additionally allow us to issue or incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock so long as a Financial Covenant Effectiveness Period (as defined in the New Facilities) is not in effect; provided, however, that certain of our other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence or other exemptions are not available. The New Facilities also contain certain restrictions on the amount of secured first priority debt we are able to incur. The New Facilities also allow for the voluntary repurchase of any debt or other convertible debt, so long as the New Facilities are not in default and we maintain availability under our revolver of more than $365.0 million.​The New Facilities have a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (i) on any date on which availability under the revolver is less than $200.0 million or (ii) on the third consecutive business day on which availability under the revolver is less than $250.0 million and, in each case, ending on and excluding the first day thereafter, if any, which is the 30th consecutive calendar day on which availability under the revolver is equal to or greater than $250.0 million. As of November 30, 2019, we had availability under our New Facilities of $1,481.8 million, our fixed charge coverage ratio was greater than 1.00 to 1.00, and we were in compliance with the New Facilities’ financial covenant. The New Facilities also contain covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt, the payments of dividends, sale of assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens.​The New Facilities provide for customary events of default including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants and bankruptcy. It is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of $50.0 million or any event occurs that enables, or which with the giving of notice or the 68
Table of Contentslapse of time would enable, the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repayment repurchase, redemption or defeasance of such debt.​The indenture that governs our guaranteed unsecured notes contains restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that we may incur.  As of November 30, 2019, we had the ability to (i) draw the full amount under our revolving credit facility, (ii) incur additional secured debt, and (iii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions.  The ability to issue additional unsecured debt under the indenture is generally governed by an interest coverage ratio test. As of November 30, 2019, we had the ability to issue additional secured and unsecured debt under the indentures governing our unguaranteed unsecured notes.​Net Cash Provided by/Used in Operating, Investing and Financing Activities​Cash provided by operating activities was $93.7 million and $50.2 million for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. Operating cash flow was positively impacted by lower WBA TSA receivables due to fewer stores on the TSA, a reduction in amounts due from CMS, higher accrued interest and an increase in accounts payable relating to our pharmacy network, partially offset by an increase in receivables due from customers in our Pharmacy Services segment.​Cash used in investing activities was $106.6 million and $152.4 million for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. Cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment was consistent with the prior year. During the thirty-nine week period ended November 30, 2019, we remodeled 65 stores and spent $33.4 million on file buys. Proceeds from the disposition of assets and investments includes cash proceeds associated with the monetization of company-owned life insurance.​Cash flow provided by financing activities was $141.1 million compared to cash flow used in financing activities of $791.3 million for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 2019 reflects net revolver borrowings, partially offset by the repayment of a portion of our 6.875% notes and 7.7% notes. ​Capital Expenditures​During the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018 capital expenditures were as follows:​​Future Liquidity​We are highly leveraged. Our high level of indebtedness could: (i) limit our ability to obtain additional financing; (ii) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt; (iv) render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and (v) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt. Based upon our current levels of operations, we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the revolver and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months. Based on our liquidity position, which 69
Table of Contentswe expect to remain strong, we do not expect to be subject to the fixed charge covenant in our New Facilities in the next twelve months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance, and other relevant circumstances, and we may evaluate alternative sources of liquidity, including opportunities related to the receivable due to us from CMS. From time to time, we may seek additional deleveraging or refinancing transactions, including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock or other debt securities, issuance of equity (including preferred stock and convertible securities), repurchase or redemption of outstanding indebtedness, or seek to refinance our outstanding debt (including our Facilities) or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities. Any of these transactions could impact our financial results. We may also use additional Sale proceeds for one or more of these purposes in accordance with our outstanding agreements. ​Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates​For a description of the critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in our Fiscal 2019 10-K, which we filed with the SEC on April 25, 2019, and the First Quarter 2020 10-Q, which we filed on July 11, 2019.​Effective March 3, 2019, the Company adopted the Lease Standard. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the adoption of this new lease standard.​Factors Affecting Our Future Prospects​For a discussion of risks related to our financial condition, operations and industry, refer to “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations” included in our Fiscal 2019 10-K.​Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share and Other Non-GAAP Measures​In addition to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures, such as “Adjusted EBITDA”, in assessing our operating performance. We believe the non-GAAP measures serve as an appropriate measure in evaluating the performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding the impact of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, LIFO adjustments (which removes the entire impact of LIFO, and effectively reflects the results as if we were on a FIFO inventory basis), charges or credits for facility closing and impairment, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, inventory write-downs related to store closings, gains or losses on debt retirements, the WBA merger termination fee, and other items (including stock-based compensation expense, merger and acquisition-related costs, a non-recurring litigation settlement (as further discussed below), severance, restructuring-related costs and costs related to facility closures and gain or loss on sale of assets). We reference this particular non-GAAP financial measure frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical periods and external comparisons to competitors. In addition, incentive compensation is primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA and we base certain of our forward-looking estimates on Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow-up with comparisons of actual to planned Adjusted EBITDA.​70
Table of ContentsThe following is a reconciliation of our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018:​(a)During fiscal 2019, we revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer exclude the impact of revenue deferrals related to our customer loyalty program and further revised our disclosure by presenting certain amounts previously included within Other as separate reconciling items. Consequently, we revised Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and thirty-nine week period ended December 1, 2018 to conform with the revised definition and present separate reconciling items previously included with Other.​The following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per Diluted Share for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 2019 and December 1, 2018. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of amortization expense, merger and acquisition-related costs, a non-recurring litigation settlement (as further discussed below), gains or losses on debt retirements, LIFO adjustments (which removes the entire impact of LIFO, and effectively reflects the results as if we were on a FIFO inventory basis), goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring-related costs and the WBA merger termination fee. We calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share using our above-referenced definition of Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share are useful indicators of our operating performance over 71
Table of Contentsmultiple periods. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share is calculated using our above-referenced definition of Adjusted Net Income (Loss):​​(b)During fiscal 2019, we revised our definition of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share to exclude the impact of all amortization expense rather than only the impact of amortization expense related to the EnvisionRx intangible assets. Consequently, we have updated the Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended December 1, 2018 to be reflective of our modified definition.​In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per Diluted Share, we occasionally refer to several other Non-GAAP measures, on a less frequent basis, in order to describe certain components of our business and how we utilize them to describe our results. These measures include but are not limited to Adjusted EBITDA Gross Margin and Gross Profit (gross margin/gross profit excluding non-Adjusted EBITDA items), Adjusted EBITDA SG&A (SG&A expenses excluding non-Adjusted EBITDA items), FIFO Gross Margin and FIFO Gross Profit (gross margin/gross profit before LIFO charges), and Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for interest, rent on closed stores, capital expenditures, acquisition costs and the change in working capital).​We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcements in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share or other non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, and are not intended to represent an alternative measure of, operating results or of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.​​ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk​Our future earnings, cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our major market 72
Table of Contentsrisk exposure is changing interest rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense. We enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable-rate credit facilities, fixed-rate long-term obligations and derivative transactions. ​The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of November 30, 2019 and assumes that we have not repaid or refinanced our existing 6.125% Notes prior to December 31, 2022.​​Our ability to satisfy interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed.​The interest rate on our variable rate borrowings, which include our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility, are based on LIBOR. If the market rates of interest for LIBOR changed by 100 basis points as of November 30, 2019, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $15.9 million. Our annual interest expense would change by approximately $15.9 million when considering the benefit of the Cap which became effective on March 21, 2019.​A change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. Increases in interest rates would also impact our ability to refinance existing maturities on favorable terms.​ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures​(a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures​Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.​(b)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting​There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.​73
