These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included in our latest annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, and our other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).When used in these notes, unless otherwise indicated or the context suggests otherwise, references to “the Company”, “our Company”, “Helen of Troy”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to Helen of Troy Limited and its subsidiaries.  We refer to our common shares, par value $0.10 per share, as “common stock.”  References to the "FASB” refer to the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  References to “GAAP” refer to United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles.  References to “ASU” refer to the codification of GAAP in the Accounting Standards Updates issued by the FASB.  References to "ASC" refer to the codification of GAAP in the Accounting Standards Codification issued by the FASB.We incorporated as Helen of Troy Corporation in Texas in 1968 and were reorganized as Helen of Troy Limited in Bermuda in 1994.  We are a global designer, developer, importer, marketer, and distributor of an expanding portfolio of brand-name consumer products.  We have three segments: Housewares, Health & Home, and Beauty.  Our Housewares segment provides a broad range of innovative consumer products for the home.  Product offerings include food preparation tools and storage containers; cleaning, bath and garden tools and accessories; infant and toddler care products; and insulated beverage, food containers and coolers.  The Health & Home segment focuses on health care devices such as thermometers, humidifiers, blood pressure monitors, and heating pads; water filtration systems; and small home appliances such as portable heaters, fans, air purifiers, and insect control devices.  Our Beauty segment products include electric hair care, beauty care and wellness appliances; grooming tools and accessories; and liquid-, solid- and powder-based personal care and grooming products.In December 2017, we completed the divestiture of the Nutritional Supplements segment through the sale of Healthy Directions LLC and its subsidiaries to Direct Digital, LLC.  The results of the Nutritional Supplements operations have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.  For more information, see Note 5 to these condensed consolidated financial statements.  All other notes present results from continuing operations.Our business is seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales volume and operating income occur in our third fiscal quarter ending November 30th.  We purchase our products from unaffiliated manufacturers, most of which are located in China, Mexico and the United States.Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. Dollars.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.7Table of ContentsWe have reclassified, combined or separately disclosed certain amounts in the prior years’ condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform with the current period’s presentation. Note 2 - New Accounting Pronouncements  Except for the changes discussed below, there have been no changes in the information provided in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.  Adopted in Fiscal 2020In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The new guidance requires the recognition of lease liabilities, representing future minimum lease payments, on a discounted basis, and corresponding right-of-use assets on a balance sheet for most leases, along with requirements for enhanced disclosures to give financial statement users the ability to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements.  In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance  which permits application of the new guidance at the beginning of the year of adoption, recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, in addition to the method of applying the new guidance retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.  We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the transition method introduced by ASU 2018-11, which does not require revisions to comparative periods.  We elected to implement the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard, which included (i) not reassessing whether expired or existing contracts contain leases, (ii) not reassessing lease classification, and (iii) not revaluing initial direct costs for existing leases.  Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of initial lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $37.1 million and $47.2 million, respectively, as of March 1, 2019.  The difference between the lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives recorded in accordance with the previous lease guidance.  The new standard did not materially impact our condensed consolidated statements of income or cash flows (see Note 4).In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (Topic 815), which amends and simplifies hedge accounting with the intent of better aligning financial reporting for hedging relationships with an entity's risk management activities.  In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, which provides clarifications and minor improvements related to Topic 815.  Adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 3 - Revenue Recognition We adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-9 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we elected to adopt the standard using the retrospective method.  The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of non-customized consumer products to customers.  Revenue is recognized when control of, and title to, the product sold transfers to the customer.  Therefore, the timing and amount of revenue recognized was not materially impacted by the new guidance.  We have thus concluded that the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  The provisions of the new guidance did however impact the classification of certain consideration paid to our customers.  We therefore reclassified an immaterial 8Table of Contentsamount of such payments from SG&A to a reduction of net sales revenue for all periods presented.  Also, in accordance with the guidance, we reclassified an immaterial amount of estimated sales returns from a reduction of receivables to accrued expenses and other current liabilities for all periods presented.  We elected to adopt the guidance using the full retrospective method. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration for which we expect to be entitled, in exchange for transferring goods.  Certain customers may receive cash incentives such as customer discounts (including volume or trade discounts), advertising discounts and other customer-related programs which are accounted for as variable consideration.  In some cases, we apply judgment, such as contractual rates and historical payment trends, when estimating variable consideration.  In accordance with the guidance, most variable consideration is classified as a reduction to net sales.Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue.  We elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost as permitted by the guidance.  We do not have unsatisfied performance obligations since our performance obligations are satisfied at a single point in time. Note 4 - Leases Adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recording of lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $37.1 million and $47.2 million, respectively, as of March 1, 2019.  The difference between the lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to unamortized lease incentives and deferred rent recorded in accordance with the previous lease guidance.  The new standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of income or cash flows. The Company primarily has leases for office space, which are classified as operating leases.  Operating leases are included in operating lease assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and lease liabilities, non-current in our consolidated balance sheets.  Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at  commencement date.  As most of our lease contracts do not provide an explicit interest rate, we use an estimated secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We include options to extend or terminate the lease in the lease term for accounting considerations, when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.  Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than one to 13 years.  Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in a manner similar to previous accounting guidance.  We do not recognize leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the balance sheet and instead recognize the related lease payments as expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes.  Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.  Under the new guidance, operating lease expense recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of income during the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2019 was $1.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively.  Short-term lease expense is excluded from this amount and is not material.  The non-cash component of lease expense is included as an adjustment to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 9Table of ContentsA summary of supplemental lease information is as follows:  A summary of our estimated lease payments, imputed interest and liabilities are as follows:  (1) Included as part of "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Note 5 - Discontinued Operations In December 2017, we completed the divestiture of the Nutritional Supplements segment through the sale of Healthy Directions LLC and its subsidiaries ("Healthy Directions") to Direct Digital, LLC.  The purchase price from the sale was comprised of $46.0 million in cash, which was paid at closing, and a supplemental payment with a target value of $25.0 million, payable on or before August 1, 2019.  During fiscal 2019, the final amount of the supplemental payment was adjusted to $10.8 million based on a settlement with respect to the calculation of the performance of Healthy Directions through February 28, 2018.  The adjustment resulted in a corresponding pre-tax charge of $5.8 million ($4.4 million after tax) to discontinued operations.  The supplemental payment of $10.8 million was received during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  Also, during fiscal 2019, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million ($1.3 million after tax) to discontinued operations, resulting from the resolution of certain contingencies.  In conjunction with the sale of the business, we provided certain transition services that ceased during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  10Table of ContentsNote 6 - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES   Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests each fiscal year during the fourth quarter and also perform interim impairment tests, if and when necessary.  We did not record any impairment charges for the nine month periods ended November 30, 2019 or 2018, respectively.11Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the carrying amounts and accumulated amortization for all intangible assets by segment as of the end of the periods presented:  After discontinuing the formal sale process and revising the strategic initiatives for our Personal Care business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we changed trademarks related to the business with a net book value of $30.4 million from indefinite lived to finite lived assets.  The amortization of these trademarks is now included in amortization expense for the nine months ended November 30, 2019, and these assets are expected to be fully amortized by the end of fiscal year 2027.The following table summarizes the amortization expense attributable to intangible assets recorded in SG&A in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods shown below, as well as our estimated amortization expense for fiscal 2020 through 2025:12Table of ContentsNote 8 - Share-Based Compensation Plans We have equity awards outstanding under several share-based compensation plans.  During the three  and nine months ended November 30, 2019, we had the following share-based compensation activity: 13Table of Contents•Employees exercised stock options to purchase 6,892 and 68,657 shares of common stock, respectively.•There were 15,013 and 29,803 purchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan at an average price of $95.03 and $95.16, respectively. We recorded the following share-based compensation expense in SG&A for the periods shown below:  Note 9 - Repurchase of Helen of Troy Common Stock In May 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our outstanding common stock.  The authorization is effective May 8, 2019 for a period of three years and replaced Helen of Troy's previous repurchase authorization, of which approximately $107.4 million remained.  These repurchases may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated stock repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods.  The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, working capital requirements, general business conditions, financial conditions, any applicable contractual limitations, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.  As of November 30, 2019, our repurchase authorization allowed for the purchase of $393.0 million of common stock. Our current equity-based compensation plans include provisions that allow for the “net exercise” of share-settled awards by all plan participants.  In a net exercise, any required payroll taxes, federal withholding taxes and exercise price of the shares due from the equity holder can be paid for by having the equity holder tender back to the Company a number of shares at fair value equal to the amounts due.  Net exercises are treated as purchases and retirements of shares. 14Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our share repurchase activity for the periods shown:Note 10 - Restructuring Plan In October 2017, we announced that we had approved a restructuring plan (referred to as “Project Refuel”).  Project Refuel includes a reduction-in-force and the elimination of certain contracts and operating expenses.  We are targeting total annualized profit improvements of approximately $8.0 to $10.0 million over the duration of the plan.  We estimate the plan will be completed during fiscal 2020, and expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately $7.0 million over the duration of the plan.  Restructuring provisions are determined based on estimates prepared at the time the restructuring actions are approved by management and are revised periodically. For the three month period ended November 30, 2019, we incurred an insignificant amount of pre-tax restructuring charges.  For the nine month period ended November 30, 2019, we incurred $1.1 million of pre-tax restructuring charges related primarily to employee severance and termination benefits and lease termination costs.  Since implementing Project Refuel, we have incurred $6.5 million of pre-tax restructuring costs as of November 30, 2019.  During the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2019, we made total cash restructuring payments of $0.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively.  Since implementing Project Refuel, we have made total cash restructuring payments of $6.0 million.  We had a remaining liability of $0.5 million as of November 30, 2019.Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters – In May 2018, we settled a patent infringement dispute related to two forehead thermometer models sold by our subsidiary, Kaz USA, Inc., in the United States and made a settlement payment of $15.0 million, which was accrued in prior periods along with related legal fees and other costs.      We are involved in various other legal claims and proceedings in the normal course of operations.  We believe the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 15Table of ContentsLease Commitments – The implementation of the new lease guidance (ASC 842) using the effective date method requires the disclosure of our lease commitments from our latest annual report on Form 10-K for the interim periods during the first year of adoption (see Note 4).  The lease commitments as of February 28, 2019 were as follows:The minimum rental payments for operating leases presented above were determined in accordance with the previous lease guidance (ASC 840).  Note 4 presents a summary of our estimated lease payments, imputed interest and liabilities as of November 30, 2019, in accordance with the new lease guidance (ASC 842). Note 12 - Long-Term Debt We have a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders that provided for an unsecured total revolving commitment of $1.0 billion as of November 30, 2019.  The commitment under the Credit Agreement terminates and the Credit Agreement matures on December 7, 2021.  Borrowings accrue interest under one of two alternative methods (based upon a base rate of LIBOR) as described in the Credit Agreement.  With each borrowing against our credit line, we can elect the interest rate method based on our funding needs at the time.  We also incur loan commitment fees and letter of credit fees under the Credit Agreement.  Outstanding letters of credit reduce the borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  As of November 30, 2019, the outstanding revolving loan principal balance was $225.8 million (excluding prepaid financing fees) and the face amount of outstanding letters of credit was $9.0 million.  For the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2019, borrowings under the Credit Agreement incurred interest charges at rates ranging from 2.7% to 5.3% and 2.7% to 5.5%, respectively.  For the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2018, borrowings under the Credit Agreement incurred interest charges at rates ranging from 3.1% to 5.3% and 2.8% to 5.3%, respectively.  As of November 30, 2019, the amount available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was $765.2 million.  Covenants in our debt agreements limit the amount of total indebtedness we can incur.  As of November 30, 2019, these covenants effectively limited our ability to incur more than $730.5 million of additional debt from all sources, including our Credit Agreement, or $765.2 million in the event a qualified acquisition is consummated.  The following table summarizes our long-term debt as of the end of the periods shown:  16Table of Contents(2)The Credit Agreement matures on December 7, 2021.  The Credit Agreement's floating interest rates are hedged with interest rate swaps to effectively fix interest rates on $225 million of the outstanding principal balance under the Credit Agreement.  Notes 13 and 14 to these condensed consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding the interest rate swaps.At November 30, 2019 and February 28, 2019, our long-term debt has floating interest rates, and its book value approximates its fair value. All of our debt is unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.  Our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as each of these terms is defined in the agreements).  Our debt agreements also contain other customary covenants.  We were in compliance with the terms of these agreements as of November 30, 2019. Note 13 - Fair Value We classify our various assets and liabilities recorded or reported at fair value under a hierarchy prescribed by GAAP that prioritizes inputs to fair value measurement techniques into three broad levels:Level 1:Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;Level 2:Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; andLevel 3:Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.Assets and liabilities subject to classification are classified upon acquisition.  When circumstances dictate the transfer of an asset or liability to a different level, our policy is to recognize the transfer at the beginning of the reporting period in which the event resulting in the transfer occurred.  The following tables present the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of the end of the periods shown:17Table of Contents(1)Our financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 because their valuation is dependent on observable inputs and other quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or model-derived valuations whose significant value drivers are observable.The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items.We use derivatives for hedging purposes and our derivatives are primarily interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts and cross-currency debt swaps.  See Notes 12 and 14 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our hedging activities.We classify our floating rate debt as a Level 2 item because the estimation of the fair market value requires the use of a discount rate based upon current market rates of interest for obligations with comparable remaining terms.  Such comparable rates are considered significant other observable market inputs.  The book value of the floating rate debt approximates its fair value as of the reporting date.Our other non-financial assets include goodwill and other intangible assets, which we classify as Level 3 items.  These assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as part of our impairment testing.  Note 7 to these condensed consolidated financial statements contains additional information related to intangible asset impairments.Note 14 - Financial Instruments and Risk Management Foreign Currency Risk - Our functional currency is the U.S. Dollar.  By operating internationally, we are subject to foreign currency risk from transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (“foreign currencies”).  Such transactions include sales, certain inventory purchases and operating expenses.  As a result of such transactions, portions of our cash, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable are denominated in foreign currencies.  During the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2019, approximately 17% and 14%, respectively, of our net sales revenue was in foreign currencies.  For both the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2018, approximately 13% of our net sales revenue was in foreign currencies.  These sales were primarily denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, and Mexican Pesos.  We make most of our inventory purchases from the Far East and primarily use the U.S. Dollar for such purchases.In our condensed consolidated statements of income, exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign taxes receivable, taxes payable, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized in their respective income tax lines, and all other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in SG&A.  During the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2019, we recorded net foreign exchange gains and (losses) from remeasurement, including the impact of currency hedges 18Table of Contentsand the cross-currency debt swaps, of $0.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in SG&A compared to $0.3 million and $(0.8) million, respectively.   We hedge against certain foreign currency exchange rate-risk by using a series of forward contracts and zero-cost collars designated as cash flow hedges and mark-to-market derivatives to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  We do not enter into any forward exchange contracts or similar instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into SG&A in the same period they are settled.  The ineffective portion, which is not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in SG&A.Interest Rate Risk - Interest on our outstanding debt as of November 30, 2019 is based on floating interest rates.  If short-term interest rates increase, we will incur higher interest expense on any future outstanding balances of floating rate debt.  Floating interest rates are hedged with interest rate swaps to effectively fix interest rates on $225.0 million of the outstanding principal balance under the Credit Agreement, which totaled $225.8 million (excluding prepaid finance fees) as of November 30, 2019.The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments as of the end of the periods shown:19Table of Contents(1)These are foreign currency contracts for which we have not elected hedge accounting.  We refer to them as “cross-currency debt swaps”.  They, in effect, adjust the currency denomination of a portion of our outstanding debt to the Euro and British Pound, as applicable, for the notional amounts reported, creating an economic hedge against currency movements. The following table summarizes the pre-tax effect of derivative instruments for the periods shown:We expect pre-tax losses of $1.5 million associated with foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, to be reclassified into income over the next twelve months.  The amount ultimately realized, however, will differ as exchange rates vary and the underlying contracts settle. Counterparty Credit Risk - Financial instruments, including foreign currency contracts and cross currency debt swaps, expose us to counterparty credit risk for non-performance.  We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk by only dealing with counterparties who are substantial international financial institutions with significant experience using such derivative instruments.  Although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then-estimated fair value of these instruments, we believe that the risk of incurring credit losses is remote.20Table of ContentsNote 15 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table summarizes changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component and related tax effects for periods shown:See Notes 12, 13 and 14 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Note 16 - Segment Information The following tables present segment information included in continuing operations for the periods shown:21Table of ContentsWe compute segment operating income based on net sales revenue, less cost of goods sold, SG&A, restructuring charges, and any asset impairment charges associated with the segment.  The SG&A used to compute each segment’s operating income is directly associated with the segment, plus shared service and corporate overhead expenses that are allocable to the segment.  We do not allocate non-operating income and expense, including interest or income taxes, to operating segments.Note 17 - Income Taxes Due to our organization in Bermuda and the ownership structure of our foreign subsidiaries, many of which are not owned directly or indirectly by a U.S. parent company, an immaterial amount of our foreign income is subject to U.S. taxation on a permanent basis under current law.  Additionally, our intellectual property is largely owned by our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in proportionally higher earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates, which decreases our overall effective tax rate.For interim periods, our income tax expense and resulting effective tax rate are based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for the effects of items required to be treated as discrete to the period, including changes in tax laws, changes in estimated exposures for uncertain tax positions and other items.  For the three months ended November 30, 2019, income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 10.3% compared to 6.9% for the same period last year.  The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to shifts in the mix of taxable income in our various tax jurisdictions and increases in certain statutory tax rates.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2019, income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 9.6%, which included $1.0 million of tax benefits from share-based compensation settlements, $1.7 million of expense from the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to tax rate changes, and a $2.8 million benefit from the resolution of an uncertain tax position.  Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 7.2% for the same period last year, which included $0.7 million tax benefits from share-based compensation settlements and a $0.8 million benefit from the lapse of the statute of limitations related to an uncertain tax position.  The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to shifts in the mix of taxable income in our various tax jurisdictions, increases in certain statutory tax rates and the comparative impact of discrete benefits recorded in the same period last year.   22Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2017, we received an assessment from a state tax authority which adjusted taxable income applicable to the particular state resulting from interpretations of certain state income tax provisions applicable to our legal structure.  We believe we have accurately reported our taxable income and are vigorously protesting the assessment through administrative processes with the state.  We believe it is unlikely that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  Our Macau subsidiary generates income from the sale of the goods that it has sourced and procured.  This subsidiary is responsible for the sourcing and procurement of a large portion of the products that we sell.  We currently have an indefinite tax holiday in Macau conditioned on the subsidiary meeting certain employment and investment thresholds.  The Macau Offshore Law and its supplementary regulations that grant tax incentives to approved offshore institutions will be abolished on January 1, 2021.  Existing approved offshore institutions such as ours can continue to operate under the offshore regime until the end of the calendar year 2020.  Beginning in calendar year 2021, we believe our Macau subsidiary will become subject to a statutory corporate income tax of approximately 12%.  The ultimate impact of this change, if any, on our overall effective tax rate will depend on a variety of factors including our mix of income by jurisdiction, transfer pricing considerations and the specific tax regulations applicable to us when we are no longer under the Macau Offshore regime.  It is not practicable for us to determine the potential impact on our financial statements until the tax changes in Macau are fully established and our transfer pricing analysis is complete.  Because our Macau subsidiary is not directly or indirectly owned by a U.S. parent, there is no U.S. tax liability associated with the income generated in Macau.Note 18 - Earnings Per Share We compute basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of shares of common stockoutstanding during the period.  We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted averagenumber of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive securities.  Dilutive securities at any given point in time may consist of outstanding options to purchase common stock and issued and contingently issuable unvested RSUs, PSUs, RSAs, PSAs and other stock based awards.  See Note 8 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock-based awards.  Anti-dilutive securities are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method. The following table presents our weighted average basic and diluted shares for the periods shown:23Table of ContentsNote 19 - Subsequent Events On December 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Drybar Products LLC, which includes the Drybar trademark and other intellectual property assets associated with Drybar’s products, as well as certain related production assets and working capital.  As part of the transaction, we will grant a worldwide license to Drybar Holdings LLC, the owner and long-time operator of Drybar blowout salons, to use the Drybar trademark in their continued operation of Drybar salons.  The salons will exclusively use, promote, and sell Helen of Troy’s Drybar products globally.  The total purchase consideration is $255.0 million in cash, subject to certain customary closing adjustments.  We expect to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings from our existing revolving credit facility.  The acquisition is expected to close by January 31, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.   24Table of ContentsITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations.  Actual results may differ materially due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this report. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this report and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 (“Form 10-K”) and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).  This discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this report.  When used in the MD&A, unless otherwise indicated or the context suggests otherwise, references to “the Company”, “our Company”, “Helen of Troy”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to Helen of Troy Limited and its subsidiaries.  Throughout MD&A, we refer to our Leadership Brands, which are brands that have number-one and number-two positions in their respective categories and consist of the OXO, Honeywell, Braun, PUR, Hydro Flask, Vicks, and Hot Tools brands. This MD&A, including the tables under the headings “Operating income, operating margin, adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) and adjusted operating margin (non-GAAP) by segment" and “Income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations, adjusted income from continuing operations (non-GAAP), and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP),” respectively, reports operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations without the impact of non-cash asset impairment charges, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, and non-cash share-based compensation for the periods presented, as applicable.  These measures may be considered non-GAAP financial information as set forth in SEC Regulation G, Rule 100.  The tables reconcile these measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income.  We believe that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, in combination with our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of such charges on applicable income, margin and earnings per share measures.  We also believe that these non-GAAP measures facilitate a more direct comparison of our performance to our competitors.  We further believe that including the excluded charges would not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which the charges are incurred, even though such charges may be incurred and reflected in our GAAP financial results in the near future.  The material limitation associated with the use of the non-GAAP financial measures is that the non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic impact of our activities.  Our adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not an alternative to GAAP financial information and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other companies.  Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on non-GAAP information.  These measures are discussed further and reconciled to their applicable GAAP based measures contained in this MD&A beginning on page 36. 25Table of ContentsOVERVIEWWe incorporated as Helen of Troy Corporation in Texas in 1968 and were reorganized as Helen of Troy Limited in Bermuda in 1994.  We are a leading global consumer products company offering creative products and solutions for our customers through a diversified portfolio of well-recognized and widely-trusted brands.  We have built leading market positions through new product innovation, product quality and competitive pricing.  We currently operate in three segments consisting of Housewares, Health & Home, and Beauty.  In fiscal 2015, we launched a five-year transformational strategy designed to improve the performance of our business segments and strengthen our shared service capabilities.  Fiscal 2019 marked the completion of Phase I of our multi-year transformation strategy, which delivered performance across a wide range of measures.  We improved core sales growth by focusing on our Leadership Brands, made strategic acquisitions, became a more efficient operating company with strong global shared services, upgraded our organization and culture, improved inventory turns and return on invested capital, and returned capital to shareholders. Fiscal 2020 began Phase II of our transformation and is designed to drive the next five years of progress.  The long-term objectives of Phase II include improved organic sales growth, continued margin expansion, and strategic and effective capital deployment.  We expect Phase II will include continued investment in our Leadership Brands, with a focus on growing them through consumer-centric innovation, expanding them more aggressively outside the United States, and adding new brands through acquisition.  We anticipate building further shared service capability and operating efficiency, as well as attracting, retaining, unifying and training the best people. On December 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Drybar Products LLC, which includes the Drybar trademark and other intellectual property assets associated with Drybar’s products, as well as certain related production assets and working capital.  As part of the transaction, we will grant a worldwide license to Drybar Holdings LLC, the owner and long-time operator of Drybar blowout salons, to use the Drybar trademark in their continued operation of Drybar salons.  The salons will exclusively use, promote, and sell Helen of Troy’s Drybar products globally.  The total cash consideration is $255.0 million, subject to certain customary closing adjustments. We expect to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings from our existing revolving credit facility.  The acquisition is expected to close by January 31, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.In fiscal 2018, we announced that we had approved a restructuring plan (“Project Refuel”).  Project Refuel includes a reduction-in-force and the elimination of certain contracts and operating expenses.  We are targeting total annualized profit improvements of approximately $8.0 to $10.0 million over the duration of the plan.  We estimate the plan will be completed during fiscal 2020, and expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately $7.0 million over the duration of the plan.  Since implementing Project Refuel, we have incurred $6.5 million of pre-tax restructuring costs as of November 30, 2019.  For additional information regarding Project Refuel, see Note 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.In December 2017, we completed the divestiture of the Nutritional Supplements segment through the sale of Healthy Directions LLC and its subsidiaries ("Healthy Directions") to Direct Digital, LLC.  The purchase price from the sale was comprised of $46.0 million in cash, which was paid at closing, and a supplemental payment with a target value of $25.0 million, payable on or before August 1, 2019.  The final amount of the supplemental payment was adjusted based on a settlement with respect to the calculation of the performance of Healthy Directions through February 28, 2018.  During fiscal 2019, we reduced the estimated value of the supplemental payment to $10.8 million and recorded a corresponding pre-tax charge of $5.8 million ($4.4 million after tax) to discontinued operations.  The supplemental payment of $10.8 million was received during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  Also, during fiscal 2019, 26Table of Contentswe recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million ($1.3 million after tax) to discontinued operations, resulting from the resolution of certain contingencies.  In conjunction with the sale of the business, we provided certain transition services that ceased during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  Following the sale, we no longer consolidate our former Nutritional Supplements segment's operating results.  Unless otherwise indicated, all results presented are from continuing operations. Significant Trends Impacting the Business Impact of TariffsDuring fiscal years 2019 and 2020, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (‘‘USTR’’) has imposed, and in certain cases subsequently reduced or removed, additional tariffs on products imported from China.  We purchase a high concentration of our products from unaffiliated manufacturers located in China.  This concentration exposes us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs.  The tariff increases that have been implemented by the USTR began to impact our cost of goods sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and will continue to do so, as long as these tariff increases remain in effect.  In December 2019, the U.S. and China announced an interim trade agreement to halt additional tariff increases that were due to become effective before the end of the year and reverse some tariff increases that became effective in September 2019.  The specific details of the interim trade agreement are unclear, as is the ultimate outcome of the broader trade negotiations.  At this time, we expect to mitigate the impact of tariff increases primarily through pricing actions and product cost reductions in our supply chain.  Although our pricing actions are intended to offset the gross profit dollar impact of tariff increases, there are no assurances that the pricing actions will be successful in fully offsetting this impact or will not reduce retail consumption or customer orders in the short-term. Since July 2018, the USTR has periodically issued lists of products that are excluded from tariffs on Chinese imports.  Under the USTR exclusion process, companies have the opportunity to seek to have particular products excluded from the tariff lists and apply for a refund. Potential Impact of Brexit and Offshore Receipts in Respect of Intangible Property TaxThe potential exit of the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") from European Union ("E.U.") membership (commonly referred to as "Brexit") could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. Negotiations are ongoing to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the E.U., including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U.  The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. These measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees.  In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate.The U.K.’s Offshore Receipts in respect of Intangible Property ("ORIP") rules were introduced by the Finance Act 2019 and came into effect on April 6, 2019.  Under the ORIP rules, where intangible property ("IP") is held in offshore companies, in a territory with which the U.K. does not have a full double taxation arrangement and the IP is used directly or indirectly to enable, facilitate or promote U.K. sales, income derived from that IP could be subject to a U.K. gross receipts tax at 20% of the gross amounts.  Based on currently available information, we intend to treat this tax as a transactional tax included in operating expenses.  Certain aspects of this legislation and its implementation remain unclear at this time and we expect that additional regulations or guidance may be issued and the accounting treatment of the new tax may be clarified. 27Table of ContentsWhile we do not believe the ORIP tax will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated operating results, we do believe that it could be material to the profitability of our EMEA operating unit.  As a result, the ORIP tax could cause us to evaluate different strategic choices with respect to our EMEA operating unit, including a rationalization of the product portfolio sold in the U.K. or an exit from the market, which could adversely impact our net sales revenue.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Due to the nature of our operations, we have exposure to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates from transactions that are denominated in a currency other than our reporting currency (the U.S. Dollar). The most significant currencies affecting our operating results are the British Pound, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Mexican Peso.  For the three months ended November 30, 2019, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated U.S. Dollar reported net sales revenue of approximately $2.3 million, or 0.5%, compared to an unfavorable impact of $1.8 million, or 0.4% for the same period last year.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2019, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated U.S. dollar reported net sales revenue of approximately $6.8 million, or 0.6%, compared to a favorable impact of $1.4 million, or 0.1% for the same period last year.Consumer Spending and Changes in Shopping PreferencesOur business depends upon discretionary consumer demand for most of our products and primarily operates within mature and highly developed consumer markets.  The principal driver of our operating performance is the strength of the U.S. retail economy.  For the three month periods ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, U.S. shipments were approximately 80% of our net sales.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, U.S. shipments were approximately 79% and 78% of our net sales, respectively.   Additionally, the shift in consumer shopping preferences to online or multichannel shopping experiences has changed the concentration of our sales.  For the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2019, our net sales to retail customers fulfilling end-consumer online orders and online sales directly to consumers comprised approximately 24% of our total consolidated net sales revenue, and grew approximately 30% and 28%, respectively, over the same periods last year.  For the three and nine month periods ended November 30, 2018, our net sales to retail customers fulfilling end-consumer online orders and online sales directly to consumers comprised approximately 20% of our total consolidated net sales revenue, and grew approximately 9% and 25%, respectively, over the same periods last year.  With the continued growth in online sales across the retail landscape, many brick and mortar retailers are aggressively looking for ways to improve their customer delivery capabilities to be able to meet customer expectations.  As a result, it will become increasingly important for us to leverage our distribution capabilities in order to meet the changing demands of our customers, as well as to increase our online capabilities to support our direct-to-consumer sales channels and online channel sales by our retail customers. Variability of the Cough/Cold/Flu Season Sales in several of our Health & Home segment categories are highly correlated to the severity of winter weather and cough/cold/flu incidence.  In the U.S., the cough/cold/flu season historically runs from November through March, with peak activity normally in January to March.  For the 2018-2019 season, fall and winter weather was generally milder than historical averages and cough/cold/flu incidence was significantly lower than the 2017-2018 season, which was an above average season.  28Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following tables provide selected operating data, in U.S. Dollars, as a percentage of net salesrevenue, and as a year-over-year percentage change:(1)During fiscal 2018, we divested our Nutritional Supplements segment, which is reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Consolidated and Segment Net SalesThe following tables summarize the impact that core business, foreign exchange and acquisitions, as applicable, had on our net sales revenue by segment: 31Table of ContentsIn the above tables, core business refers to our net sales revenue associated with product lines or brands after the first twelve months from the date the product line or brand is acquired, excluding the impact that foreign currency had on reported net sales.  Net sales revenue from internally developed brands or product lines is considered core business activity. Leadership Brand and Other Net SalesThe following tables summarize our Leadership Brand and other net sales: Consolidated Net Sales RevenueComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Consolidated net sales revenue increased $43.7 million, or 10.1%, to $474.7 million, compared to $431.1 million.  The growth was driven by a core business increase of $46.0 million, or 10.7%, primarily reflecting: •growth in consolidated online sales; •an increase in brick and mortar sales in our Housewares segment;•higher international sales; and •an increase in sales in the appliance category in the Beauty segment.These factors were partially offset by: •lower sales in our Health & Home segment; •the unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $2.3 million, or 0.5%; and•a decline in the personal care category in the Beauty segment.  Net sales from our Leadership Brands were $379.6 million, compared to $343.4 million for the same period last year, representing growth of 10.6%.

Growth was driven by a core business increase of $40.8 million, or 28.5%, primarily due to: •point of sale growth with existing domestic brick and mortar customers; •an increase in online sales; •an increase in international sales;•higher club sales; and•new product introductions. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $0.5 million, or 0.3%.   Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Net sales revenue increased $98.3 million, or 24.7%, to $496.0 million, compared to $397.7 million.  Growth was primarily driven by a core business increase of $99.5 million, or 25.0%, due to:•point of sale growth and incremental distribution with existing domestic brick and mortar customers; •an increase in online sales; •higher club and closeout sales; and•new product introductions.  These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $1.3 million, or 0.3%.Health & HomeComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Net sales revenue decreased $2.1 million, or 1.1%, to $185.8 million, compared to $187.9 million.  The decline was driven by a core business decline of $1.0 million, or 0.5% due to lower domestic sales driven by the unfavorable comparative impact from more wildfire activity in the same period last year and net distribution changes year-over-year.  These factors were partially offset by revenue from new product introductions and growth in international sales. Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Net sales revenue decreased $27.5 million, or 5.2%, to $499.5 million compared to $527.1 million.  The decline was primarily driven by a core business decline of $23.5 million, or 4.5%, due to:•lower domestic sales driven by net distribution changes year-over-year, the unfavorable comparative impacts of a strong cough/cold/flu season and more wildfire activity in the same period last year; and•lower international sales.These factors were partially offset by revenue from new product introductions.   33Table of ContentsBeautyComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Net sales revenue increased $5.4 million, or 5.4%, to $105.7 million, compared to $100.3 million.  The increase was driven by an increase in core business sales of $6.2 million, or 6.2%, primarily due to:•increased demand and new product introductions in the appliance category;•growth in the online channel; and•an increase in international sales. These factors were partially offset by a decline in net sales in the personal care category and the unfavorable impact of net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $0.8 million, or 0.8%.Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Net sales revenue increased $15.0 million, or 5.9%, to $269.5 million, compared to $254.5 million.

These factors were partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the personal care category and the unfavorable impact of net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $1.6 million, or 0.6%. Consolidated Gross Profit MarginComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Consolidated gross profit margin increased 2.0 percentage points to 44.2%, compared to 42.2%.  The increase in consolidated gross profit margin was primarily due to:•a higher mix of Housewares sales at a higher overall gross profit margin; and•a favorable product and channel mix within the Housewares segment.These factors were partially offset by a lower mix of personal care sales in the Beauty segment.Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Consolidated gross profit margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 42.8%, compared to 41.0%.  The increase in consolidated gross profit margin was primarily due to:•a higher mix of Housewares sales at a higher overall gross profit margin; •a favorable product mix within the Housewares segment; •a lower mix of shipments made on a direct import basis; and•tariff exclusion refunds received for certain duties expensed in the second half of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020.These factors were partially offset by:•the net margin dilutive impact from tariffs and related pricing actions;•unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations;•a lower mix of personal care sales in the Beauty segment; and•higher inbound freight expense. 34Table of ContentsConsolidated SG&AComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Consolidated SG&A ratio decreased 0.5 percentage points to 27.5%, compared to 28.0%.

The increase in the consolidated SG&A ratio was primarily due to:•higher annual incentive compensation expense;•the unfavorable impact of a lower mix of shipments made on a direct import basis;•acquisition-related expenses;•higher freight and distribution expense; and•higher amortization expense.These factors were partially offset by:•the impact from tariff related pricing actions taken with retail customers; •the impact that higher overall sales had on net operating leverage; •lower advertising expense; and•the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements.Restructuring ChargesComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019We incurred insignificant restructuring charges for both periods. Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 We incurred $1.1 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, compared to $2.6 million.  The charges related primarily to employee severance and termination benefits and contract termination costs.35Table of ContentsOperating income, operating margin, adjusted operating income (non-GAAP), and adjusted operating margin (non-GAAP) by segmentIn order to provide a better understanding of the comparative impact of certain items on operating income, the tables that follow report the comparative before tax impact of non-cash asset impairment charges, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, and non‐cash share‐based compensation, as applicable, on operating income and operating margin for each segment and in total for the periods covered below.  Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin may be considered non-GAAP financial measures as contemplated by SEC Regulation G, Rule 100.  For additional information regarding management’s decision to present this non-GAAP financial information, see the introduction to this Item 2., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 36Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating IncomeComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Consolidated operating income was $79.3 million, or 16.7% of net sales, compared to $61.3 million, or 14.2% of net sales, for the same period last year.  The increase was driven by the following factors: •a higher mix of Housewares sales at a higher overall operating margin;•a favorable product and channel mix within the Housewares segment; •the favorable impact that higher overall net sales had on operating expense leverage; and•lower advertising expense.These factors were partially offset by:•higher annual incentive compensation expense;•acquisition-related expenses;•higher amortization expense; and•higher freight and distribution expense.Consolidated adjusted operating income increased 27.8% to $90.3 million, or 19.0% of net sales, compared to $70.6 million, or 16.4% of net sales, in the same period last year. Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Consolidated operating income was $181.0 million, or 14.3% of net sales, compared to $155.3 million, or 13.2% of net sales, for the same period last year.  The increase was driven by the following factors:•tariff exclusion refunds received for certain duties expensed in the second half of fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020; •a higher mix of Housewares sales at a higher overall operating margin;•a favorable product mix within the Housewares segment; •the favorable impact that higher overall net sales had on operating expense leverage;•lower advertising expense; and•the net favorable comparative impact of pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.5 million.These factors were partially offset by:•higher annual incentive compensation expense; •higher freight and distribution expense;•acquisition-related expenses in the current period;•higher amortization expense; and•the net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.Consolidated adjusted operating income increased 16.0% to $215.4 million, or 17.0% of net sales, compared to $185.7 million, or 15.8% of net sales, for the same period last year. HousewaresComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Operating income was $42.3 million, or 23.1% of segment net sales, compared to $29.8 million, or 20.9% of segment net sales, for the same period last year.  The 2.2 percentage point increase in segment operating margin was primarily due to:•the margin impact of a more favorable product and channel mix; •the impact that higher sales had on operating leverage; and•lower advertising expense.37Table of ContentsThese factors were partially offset by higher freight and distribution expense to support increased retail customer shipments and strong direct-to-consumer demand.Adjusted operating income increased 36.8% to $44.6 million, or 24.3% of segment net sales, compared to $32.6 million, or 22.8% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Operating income was $109.2 million, or 22.0% of segment net sales, for the nine months ended November 30, 2019, compared to $80.4 million, or 20.2% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.  The 1.8 percentage point increase in segment operating margin was primarily due to: •the margin impact of a more favorable product and channel mix;•the impact that higher sales had on operating leverage; and•the net favorable comparative impact of pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.7 million.  These factors were partially offset by:•higher annual incentive compensation expense;•higher advertising expense; and•higher freight and distribution center expense to support increased retail customer shipments and strong direct-to-consumer demand.Adjusted operating income increased 31.3% to $116.6 million, or 23.5% of segment net sales, compared to $88.8 million, or 22.3% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.Health & HomeComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Operating income was $24.4 million, or 13.1% of segment net sales, compared to $19.2 million, or 10.2% of segment net sales in the same period last year.  The 2.9 percentage point increase in segment operating margin was primarily due to: •lower advertising expense; and•the margin impact of a more favorable product mix.These factors were offset by unfavorable operating leverage from the decline in sales.Adjusted operating income increased 17.7% to $28.8 million, or 15.5% of segment net sales, compared to $24.5 million, or 13.0% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.  Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Operating income was $51.8 million, or 10.4% of segment net sales, compared to $52.5 million, or 10.0% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.  The 0.4 percentage point increase in segment operating margin was primarily due to: •tariff exclusion refunds received for certain duties expensed in the second half of fiscal 2019 and first quarter of fiscal 2020;•lower advertising expense; and•lower product liability claim expense.These factors were partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and unfavorable operating leverage from the decline in sales.Adjusted operating income decreased 0.4% to $67.8 million, or 13.6% of segment net sales, compared to $68.0 million, or 12.9% of segment net sales, in the same period last year. 38Table of ContentsBeautyComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Operating income was $12.6 million, or 11.9% of segment net sales, compared to $12.2 million, or 12.2% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.  The 0.3 percentage point decrease in segment operating margin was primarily due to:•higher annual incentive compensation expense;•acquisition-related expenses;•higher amortization expense; and•the unfavorable margin impact of a lower mix of personal care sales.These factors were partially offset by lower advertising expense.Adjusted operating income increased 24.7% to $16.9 million, or 16.0% of segment net sales, compared to $13.6 million, or 13.5% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Operating income was $20.0 million, or 7.4% of segment net sales, compared to operating income of $22.4 million, or 8.8% of segment net sales, in the same period last year.  The 1.4 percentage point decrease in segment operating margin was primarily due to: •the impact of higher freight expense to meet strong demand in the appliance category; •higher annual incentive and share-based compensation expense related to short- and long-term performance; •higher amortization expense; •acquisition-related expenses; and •the unfavorable margin impact of a lower mix of personal care sales. These factors were partially offset by lower advertising expense and the net favorable comparative impact of pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.5 million.Adjusted operating income increased 7.4% to $31.0 million, or 11.5% of segment net sales, compared to $28.9 million, or 11.4% of segment net sales, in the same period last year. Interest Expense Comparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Interest expense was $2.8 million, compared to $3.0 million.  The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average levels of debt outstanding and lower average interest rates. Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Interest expense was $9.3 million, compared to $8.4 million.  The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Income Tax Expense The period-over-period comparison of our effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of taxable income in our various tax jurisdictions.  Due to our organization in Bermuda and the ownership structure of our foreign subsidiaries, many of which are not owned directly or indirectly by a U.S. parent company, an immaterial amount of our foreign income is subject to U.S. taxation on a permanent basis under current law.  Additionally, our intellectual property is largely owned by our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in 39Table of Contentsproportionally higher earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates, which decreases our overall effective tax rate.  For the three months ended November 30, 2019, income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 10.3% compared to 6.9% for the same period last year.  The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to shifts in the mix of taxable income in our various tax jurisdictions and increases in certain statutory tax rates.  For the nine months ended November 30, 2019, income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 9.6%, which included $1.0 million of tax benefits from share-based compensation settlements, $1.7 million of expense from the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to tax rate changes, and a $2.8 million benefit from the resolution of an uncertain tax position.  Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 7.2% for the same period last year, which included $0.7 million tax benefits from share-based compensation settlements and a $0.8 million benefit from the lapse of the statute of limitations related to an uncertain tax position.  The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to shifts in the mix of taxable income in our various tax jurisdictions, increases in certain statutory tax rates and the comparative impact of discrete benefits recorded in the same period last year.  During fiscal 2017, we received an assessment from a state tax authority which adjusted taxable income applicable to the particular state resulting from interpretations of certain state income tax provisions applicable to our legal structure.  We believe we have accurately reported our taxable income and are vigorously protesting the assessment through administrative processes with the state.  We believe it is unlikely that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.Our Macau subsidiary generates income from the sale of the goods it has sourced and procured.  This subsidiary is responsible for the sourcing and procurement of a large portion of the products that we sell.  We currently have an indefinite tax holiday in Macau conditioned on the subsidiary meeting certain employment and investment thresholds.  The Macau Offshore Law and its supplementary regulations that grant tax incentives to approved offshore institutions will be abolished on January 1, 2021.  Existing approved offshore institutions such as ours can continue to operate under the offshore regime until the end of the calendar year 2020.  Beginning in calendar year 2021, we believe our Macau subsidiary will become subject to a statutory corporate income tax of approximately 12%.  The ultimate impact of this change, if any, on our overall effective tax rate will depend on a variety of factors including our mix of income by jurisdiction, transfer pricing considerations and the specific tax regulations applicable to us when we are no longer under the Macau Offshore regime.  It is not practicable for us to determine the potential impact on our financial statements until the tax changes in Macau are fully established and our transfer pricing analysis is complete.  Because our Macau subsidiary is not directly or indirectly owned by a U.S. parent, there is no U.S. tax liability associated with the income generated in Macau.  40Table of ContentsIncome from continuing operations, diluted EPS from continuing operations, adjusted income from continuing operations (non-GAAP), and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) In order to provide a better understanding of the impact of certain items on our income and EPS from continuing operations, the analysis that follows reports the comparative after tax impact of non-cash asset impairment charges, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, and non-cash share‐based compensation, as applicable, on income from continuing operations, and diluted EPS from continuing operations for the periods covered below.  For additional information regarding management’s decision to present this non-GAAP financial information, see the introduction to this Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 41Table of ContentsComparison of Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 to Third Quarter Fiscal 2019Income from continuing operations was $68.7 million, compared to $54.3 million.  Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $2.71, compared to $2.06.  Diluted EPS increased primarily due to higher operating income in the Housewares segment and the impact of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding compared to the same period last year.  This was partially offset by higher income tax expense.Adjusted income from continuing operations increased $15.9 million, or 25.2%, to $79.1 million, compared to $63.2 million the same period last year.  Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 30.0% to $3.12, compared to $2.40.    Comparison of First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020 to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Income from continuing operations was $155.5 million, compared to $136.5 million.  Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $6.15, compared to $5.15.  Diluted EPS increased primarily due to the impact of higher operating income in our Housewares segment and lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding compared to the same period last year.  This was partially offset by lower operating income in our Beauty segment, higher interest expense and higher income tax expense.Adjusted income from continuing operations increased $22.2 million, or 13.4%, to $187.8 million, compared to $165.5 million.  Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 18.9% to $7.42, compared to $6.24.  42Table of ContentsFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSelected measures of our liquidity and capital resources are shown for the periods below:  _____________________(1)Accounts receivable turnover, inventory turnover and return on average equity computations use 12 month trailing net sales revenue, cost of goods sold or net income components as required by the particular measure.  The current and four prior quarters' ending balances of accounts receivable, inventory and equity are used for the purposes of computing the average balance component as required by the particular measure.We rely principally on cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to finance our operations, acquisitions, and capital expenditures.  We believe our cash flows from operations and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs.   Operating ActivitiesOperating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of $101.4 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2019, compared to $109.5 million for the same period last year.  The decrease is primarily due to an increase in cash used for accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and was partially offset by increased income from continuing operations. Investing ActivitiesDuring the nine months ended November 30, 2019, we invested in capital and intangible asset expenditures of $13.2 million, compared to $22.2 million for the same period last year.  The decrease is primarily due to the comparative impact of leasehold improvement expenditures in the same period last year.   Financing Activities Financing activities from continuing operations used $80.4 million of cash during the nine months ended November 30, 2019, compared to $84.8 million for the same period last year.  A reduction in repurchases of common stock was offset by higher net repayments on our line of credit for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period last year.  43Table of ContentsCredit and Other Debt AgreementsCredit AgreementWe have a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders that provides for an unsecured total revolving commitment of $1.0 billion as of November 30, 2019.  The commitment under the Credit Agreement terminates and the Credit Agreement matures on December 7, 2021.  Borrowings accrue interest under one of two alternative methods (based on a base rate or LIBOR) as described in the Credit Agreement.  With each borrowing against our credit line, we can elect the interest rate method based on our funding needs at the time.  We also incur loan commitment and letter of credit fees under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit reduce the borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  As of November 30, 2019, the outstanding revolving loan principal balance was $225.8 million (excluding prepaid financing fees) and the balance of outstanding letters of credit was $9.0 million.  As of November 30, 2019, the amount available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was $765.2 million.  Covenants in our debt agreements limit the amount of total indebtedness we can incur.  As of November 30, 2019, these covenants effectively limited our ability to incur more than $730.5 million of additional debt from all sources, including our Credit Agreement, or $765.2 million in the event a qualified acquisition is consummated. Other Debt AgreementsWe have an aggregate principal balance of $20.5 million (excluding prepaid financing fees) under a loan agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (the “MBFC Loan”) as of November 30, 2019.  The borrowings were used to fund construction of our Olive Branch, Mississippi distribution facility.  Since March 2018, the MBFC Loan can be called by the holder at any time.  The remaining loan balance is payable as follows: $1.9 million annually on March 1, 2020 through 2022; and $14.8 million on March 1, 2023.  Any remaining outstanding principal and interest is due upon maturity on March 1, 2023.All of our debt is unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.  Our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain key financial covenants, defined in the table below.  Our debt agreements also contain other customary covenants, including, among other things, covenants restricting or limiting us, except under certain conditions set forth therein, from (1) incurring debt, (2) incurring liens on our properties, (3) making certain types of investments, (4) selling certain assets or making other fundamental changes relating to mergers and consolidations, and (5) repurchasing shares of our common stock and paying dividends.  Our debt agreements also contain customary events of default, including failure to pay principal or interest when due, among others.  Our debt agreements are cross-defaulted to each other.  Upon an event of default under our debt agreements, the holders or lenders may, among other things, accelerate the maturity of any amounts outstanding under our debt agreements.  The commitments of the lenders to make loans to us under the Credit Agreement are several and not joint.  Accordingly, if any lender fails to make loans to us, our available liquidity could be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitments under the Credit Agreement.44Table of ContentsThe table below provides the formulas currently in effect for certain key financial covenants as defined under our debt agreements:Applicable Financial CovenantCredit Agreement and MBFC LoanInterest Coverage RatioEBIT (1) ÷ Interest Expense (1)Minimum Required:  3.00 to 1.00 Maximum Leverage RatioTotal Current and Long Term Debt (2) ÷EBITDA (1) + Pro Forma Effect of AcquisitionsMaximum Currently Allowed:  3.50 to 1.00 (3) Key Definitions:EBIT:                  Earnings Before Non-Cash Charges, Interest Expense and TaxesEBITDA:                EBIT + Depreciation and Amortization Expense + Share-based CompensationPro Forma Effect of Acquisitions:    For any acquisition, pre-acquisition EBITDA of the acquired business is included so that the EBITDA of the acquired business included in the computation equals its twelve month trailing total.  Notes:(1)Computed using totals for the latest reported four consecutive fiscal quarters.  (2)Computed using the ending balances as of the latest reported fiscal quarter. (3)In the event a qualified acquisition is consummated, the maximum leverage ratio is 4.25 to 1.00. Contractual ObligationsAs of November 30, 2019, there have been no material changes from the information provided in our latest annual report on Form 10-K.  Additional information regarding contractual obligations can be found in Notes 11, 12 and 19 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no existing activities involving special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing.Current and Future Capital NeedsBased on our current financial condition and current operations, we believe that cash flows from operations and available financing sources will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our foreseeable short- and long-term liquidity requirements, including our pending acquisition of Drybar Products LLC.  Other than the Drybar Products LLC acquisition, we expect our capital needs to stem primarily from the need to purchase sufficient levels of inventory and to carry normal levels of accounts receivable on our balance sheet. In addition, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities on a regular basis.  We may finance acquisition activity with available cash, the issuance of shares of common stock, additional debt, or other sources of financing, depending upon the size and nature of any such transaction and the status of the capital markets at the time of such acquisition.  We may also elect to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our Board authorization, subject to limitations contained in our debt agreements and based upon our assessment of a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, working capital requirements, general business conditions, financial conditions, any applicable contractual limitations, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.  We may finance share repurchases with available cash, additional debt or other sources of financing.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThere have been no material changes in the information provided in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our Form 10-K.  Additional information regarding risk management activities can be found in Notes 12, 13 and 14 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.47Table of ContentsITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.Our management, including our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2019.  Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of November 30, 2019, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGIn connection with the evaluation described above, we identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2019, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in various legal claims and proceedings in the normal course of operations.  We believe the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The ownership of our common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties.  When evaluating the Company and our business before making an investment decision regarding our securities, potential investors should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described in Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.  Since the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed therein.ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  On May 8, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our outstanding common stock.  The authorization is effective until May 2022 and replaced our former repurchase authorization, of which $107.4 million was outstanding at the time the new authorization was approved.  These repurchases may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated stock repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods.  The 48Table of Contentsnumber of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, working capital requirements, general business conditions, financial conditions, any applicable contractual limitations, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.  See Note 9 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Our current equity-based compensation plans include provisions that allow for the "net exercise" of share settled awards by all plan participants.  In a net exercise, any required payroll taxes, federal withholding taxes and exercise price of the shares due from the option or other share-based award holders are settled by having the holder tender back to us a number of shares at fair value equal to the amounts due.  Net exercises are treated as purchases and retirements of shares.  The following table summarizes our share repurchase activity for the periods shown:(1)The number of shares above includes shares of common stock acquired from employees who tendered shares to: (i) satisfy the tax withholding on equity awards as part of our long-term incentive plans or (ii) satisfy the exercise price on stock option exercises.  For the three months ended November 30, 2019, 6,509 shares were acquired at a weighted average per share price of $153.88.  (2)Reflects the remaining dollar value of shares that could be purchased under our current stock repurchase authorization through the expiration or termination of the plan.
