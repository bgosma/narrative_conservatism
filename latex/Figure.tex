Figure 1 illustrates the 8-K sample matching process. We match every news day to its first subsequent 8-K day, ignoring the successive 8-K days (if any) between two news days (Match-1), or in some cases the 8-K day coincides with news day (Match-2). TLAG is defined as the number of days elapsed between the news release date and 8-K filing date.

Figure 2 illustrates the 8-K item distribution before (left) and after (right) August 23 of 2004. Each share of pie chart shows the percentage of corporate events reported under each 8-K items. See 8-K item list in \hyperref[appd]{Appendix D}.
