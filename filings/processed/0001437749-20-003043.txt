Notes to Financial Statements

 
 

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements dated June 30, 2019. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.
 
Management of the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the use of management estimates, contain all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the period presented and to make the financial statements not misleading.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
Stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with Topic 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation in the Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to Topic 718, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the statement of operations based upon their fair values. Topic 718 rescinds the acceptance of pro forma disclosure. In December 2009, our shareholders approved the adoption of a new stock option plan, providing the Company a continued means of offering stock-based compensation. Our 2009 Stock Option Plan expired on December 8, 2019.
 
On December 31, 2019, there were 65,000 outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock.
 
The fair value of a stock option is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which values options based on the stock price at the grant date, the expected life of the option, the estimated volatility of the stock, the expected dividend payments, and the risk-free interest rate over the life of the option. There were no options granted during the quarter ended December 31, 2019.
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because option valuation models require the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the options. Our options do not have the characteristics of traded options, therefore, the option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our options.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive securities such as stock options and other contracts to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock or resulted in the issuance of Common Stock that then shared in earnings. We use the treasury stock method to compute potential common shares from stock options and the as-if-converted method to compute potential common shares from Preferred Stock.
 

7

 

 
For the six months ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, the potential dilutive effects of the preferred stock and stock options were included in the weighted-average shares outstanding.

 
 

NOTE B - INVENTORIES
 



 
At December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively, $171,734 and $123,204 of our inventory was considered non-current as it will not be used within a one year period.

 
 

NOTE C - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
During January 1995, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"). The preferred stockholders are entitled to receive, as and if declared by the board of directors, quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $.10 per share of Series A Preferred Stock per annum. Dividends will accrue without interest and will be cumulative from the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and will be payable quarterly in arrears in cash or publicly traded common stock when and if declared by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2019, no dividends have been declared. Dividends in arrears on the outstanding preferred shares total $378,952 as of December 31, 2019.
 
Holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to convert their shares of Preferred Stock into an equal number of shares of Common Stock of the Company. In addition, Preferred Stock holders have the right to vote the number of shares into which their shares are convertible into Common Stock. Such preferred shares will automatically convert into one share of Common Stock at the close of a public offering of Common Stock by the Company provided the Company receives gross proceeds of at least $1,000,000, and the initial offering price of the Common Stock sold in such offering is equal to or in excess of $1 per share. The Company is obligated to reserve an adequate number of shares of its common stock to satisfy the conversion of all the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. There were no shares converted during the reporting period. So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Company is prohibited from declaring dividends or other distributions related to its Common Stock or purchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring any of the Common Stock.

 
 

NOTE D - INCOME TAXES AND AVAILABLE CARRYFORWARD
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had consolidated income tax net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,353,000. The NOL will expire in various years ending through the year 2035. The utilization of certain loss carryforwards are limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
 

8

 

 
The components of the provision for income tax (expense) attributable to continuing operations are as follows:
 
 



 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
 



 

9

 

 
Management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of approximately $618,000 of NOL carryforwards will not be realized because management estimates that they will expire prior to their utilization. Therefore, management provided a valuation allowance of $171,381 against its deferred tax asset. Management will continue to evaluate its operating results each reporting period and assess whether it will be able to utilize all available NOL carryforwards before expiration.
 
The accounting for the effects of the rate change on deferred tax balances is complete and no provisional amounts were recorded for this item.
 
Income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 differ from the amounts computed by applying the effective income tax rate of 25.35%, to income before income taxes as a result of the following:
 



 
The earliest tax year still subject to examination by a major taxing jurisdiction is fiscal year end June 30, 2017.
 
The Company performed a review for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740-10 "Uncertainty in Income Taxes". In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents the Company's expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. As a result of this review, the Company concluded that at this time there are no uncertain tax positions, and there has been no cumulative effect on retained earnings.
 

10

 


 
 
 

NOTE E - LINE OF CREDIT
 
In fiscal 2018, the Company held a $250,000, due-on-demand line of credit with a financial institution. The line of credit was not renewed in April 2018.
 
In fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a new line of credit with a limit of $250,000 from a different financial institution. The line of credit is collateralized by all accounts and general intangibles, matures on October 9, 2020, accrues interest at the prime rate and is guaranteed by Justice Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer. At December 31, 2019, the Company owed $0 on this line of credit.

 
 

NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
We have evaluated subsequent events through February 18, 2020, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

 
 

NOTE G - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (the "ASU"), which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. Given the breadth of that scope, the new ASU will impact both financial services and non-financial services entities. The guidance in this ASU is effective for public entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Based on management's current understanding of this standard along with the underlying substance of our operations, management believes it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which aims to make leasing activities more transparent and comparable and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. The new guidelines are contained in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 842 - Leases ("ASC 842"). This ASU is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company applied this standard retrospectively on July 1, 2019 through a cumulative effect adjustment recognized as of July 1, 2019. In applying this standard, the Company elects to apply all practical expedients to not reassess the following:
 


 

1.


Whether a pre-existing contract is or contain a lease





 

2.


Whether a pre-existing lease should be classified as an operating or finance lease, and





 

3.


Whether the initial direct costs capitalized for a pre-existing lease under the previously lease accounting standard ASC Topic 840 qualify for capitalization



 
As a result, the Company recorded its right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on its balance sheet beginning July 1, 2019.
 
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the AICPA and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material effect, if any, on the Company's financial statements.

NOTE H - RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES
 
Operating leases
 
In June 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement to lease certain office equipment with a lease term of 63 months. The lease contains a renewal option to extend the term for successive one year periods. The Company is not reasonably certain that it will renew the lease when it expires. Initial rent amount was $1,079 per month, with increases each year no more than 3%. In applying ASC 842, the Company uses a lease term of 63 months and an incremental borrowing rate of 5.5% which was the borrowing rate on the Company’s line of credit with a financial institution with all accounts and general intangibles.
 
In February 2018, the Company entered in a lease agreement to lease warehouse space with a lease term of 39 months. The Company pays no rent for the first three months of the lease, pays $2,936 per month for the next 12 months, $3,024 per month for the next 8 months, $3,019 per month for the next 4 months, and $3,109 for the last 12 months. In applying ASC 842, the Company uses a lease term of 39 months and an incremental borrowing rate of 5.5% which was the borrowing rate on the Company’s line of credit with a financial institution with all accounts and general intangibles.
 
The following is information related to the Company’s right-of-use assets and liabilities for its operating leases:
 



 
Variable lease expense was $11,666, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.
 
Weighted average remaining lease term was 1.23 years and weighted average discount rate was 5.5% at December 31, 2019.

 
 
 
ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
General
 
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
 

12

 

 
This Report on Form 10-Q, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "continue," "estimate," "project," "intend," "hope," "believe" and similar expressions, variations of these words or the negative of those words, and, any statement regarding possible or assumed future results of operations of the Company's business, the markets for its products, anticipated expenditures, regulatory developments or competition, or other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding events, conditions and financial trends including, without limitation, business conditions in the skin and wound care market and the general economy, competitive factors, changes in product mix, production delays, product recalls, manufacturing capabilities, and other risks or uncertainties detailed in other of the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company's actual plan of operations, business strategy, operating results and financial position could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements.
 
Recent Developments
 
In fiscal 2019, the Company continued expanding its sales channel designed to reduce inventory costs while increasing access to AMERX full line of products, through existing markets. Amerx grew its Wound Care product line with the addition of Retention Tape and additional Bordered Foam sizes. The Helix Collagen line grew with the addition of a 7" x 7" Matrix pad.
 
In fiscal 2020, AMERX’s Extremit-Ease Compression Garment line expand with the introduction of a Tan version of the garment and matching liner. Extremit-Ease continues to gain momentum in the wound care, edema and lymphedema markets with plans to further expand the line in Fiscal 2020. The Amerx brand of wound care products expanded in Fiscal 2020 with new offerings in sizes available, for both the Amerx Foam and Calcium Alginate products.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
 
The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. A summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's annual report on form 10-K, for the year ended June 30, 2019, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2019. The estimates used by management are based upon the Company's historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Company's accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
 
Accounts Receivable Allowance
 
Accounts receivable allowance reflects a reserve that reduces our customer accounts and receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible. The valuation of accounts receivable is based upon the credit-worthiness of customers and third-party payers as well as historical collection experience. Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense for estimated amounts expected to be uncollectible from third-party payers and customers. The Company bases its estimates on its historical collection experience, current trends, credit policy and on the analysis of accounts by aging category. At December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $6,719 and $6,719, respectively.
 

13

 

 
Advertising and Marketing
 
The Company uses several forms of advertising, including sponsorships to agencies who represent the professionals in their respective fields. The Company expenses these sponsorships over the term of the advertising arrangements on a straight line basis. Other forms of advertising used by the Company include professional journal advertisements, distributor catalogs, website and mailing campaigns. These forms of advertising are expensed when incurred.
 
Deferred Income Taxes
 
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts, based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company accounts for income taxes under Topic 740 - Income Tax in the Accounting Standards Codification. A valuation allowance is used to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods. The estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us to exercise complex judgments. We periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available. The Company had a valuation allowance of $171,381 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 and a deferred tax asset of $343,740 for the same corresponding periods. Because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results, actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) release of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which requires that five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
Stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with Topic 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation in the Accounting Standards Codification. All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the statement of operations based upon their fair values. Topic 718 rescinds the acceptance of pro forma disclosure.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
As of December 31, 2019 the Company's principal sources of liquid assets included cash of $96,630, inventories of $762,561, and net accounts receivable of $631,602. The Company also has $155,055 in Certificate of Deposits. The Company had net working capital of $1,258,506, and long-term debt of $12,299, at December 31, 2019.
 

14

 

 
During the six months ended December 31, 2019 cash decreased from $290,287 as of June 30, 2019, to $96,630. Operating activities used cash of $158,385 during the period. Investing and Financing activities used cash of $11,150 and $24,122, respectively during the period.
 
The Company reflected a net non-current deferred tax asset of $172,359, at December 31, 2019. Because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results, actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Comparison of the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
Net sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, were $1,127,695 as compared to the previous year's quarter net sales of $914,462, an increase of $213,233, or approximately 23%. We believe increased sales were driven by expansion of our distribution network partners, expansion into new markets and new customer sales of both existing and new products. Net sales during the six months ended December 31, 2019, were $2,310,992 as compared to the previous year's period net sales of $2,005,088, an increase of $305,904, or approximately 15%. We believe increased sales were driven by expansion of our distribution network partners, expansion into new markets and new customer sales of both existing and new products.
 
Gross profit during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, was $802,565 as compared to $674,571 during the quarter ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $127,994 or 19%. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was approximately 71% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, and approximately 74% in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Gross profit during the six months ended December 31, 2019, was $1,665,425 as compared to $1,460,896 during the six months ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $204,529 or 14%. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was approximately 72% in the six months ended December 31, 2019, and approximately 73% in the corresponding period in 2018.
 
Operating expenses during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 were $799,614, consisting of $417,518 in salaries and benefits and $382,096 in selling, general and administrative expenses. This compares to operating expenses during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 of $747,633, consisting of $373,299 in salaries and benefits; and $374,334 in selling, general and administrative expenses. Expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, increased by $51,981 or approximately 7% compared to the corresponding quarter in 2018. Salaries and Benefits increased as a result of new hires, increased salaries and commissions based on higher sales. Operating expenses also increased due to increases in marketing expenses and implementation costs associated with installing our new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system software. Operating expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2019 were $1,547,444, consisting of $810,707 in salaries and benefits and $736,737 in selling, general and administrative expenses. This compares to operating expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2018 of $1,412,350, consisting of $732,734 in salaries and benefits; and $679,616 in selling, general and administrative expenses. Expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2019, increased by $135,094 or approximately 10% compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Salaries and Benefits increased as a result of new hires, increased salaries and commissions based on higher sales. Operating expenses also increased due to increases in marketing expenses and implementation costs associated with installing our new ERP system software.
 
Operating profit increased by $76,013 to an operating profit of $2,951 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an operating loss of $73,062 in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase in net income for the three month period, of the comparable quarter of the prior year before income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in sales. Operating profit increased by $69,435 to an operating profit of $117,981 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an operating income of $48,546 in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income for the six month period, of the comparable period of the prior year before income taxes was primarily attributable to the increases in sales.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 



(a)


Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



 
Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, management, including the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that all material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in this report has been made known to management in a timely manner and ensuring that this information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations, because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures.
 



(b)


Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting



 
As previously reported, our annual assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019 revealed a deficiency that we consider to be a material weakness: inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.
 
During fiscal 2020, the Company will continue to address changes needed to improve segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. We have added staff to grow sales. We expect that increased sales will enable us to add support staff, specifically in the accounting and shipping departments. A secondary effect of adding more staff will address needed improvements in segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.
