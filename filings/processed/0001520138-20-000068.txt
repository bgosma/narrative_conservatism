SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
In addition to historical information, this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are those that predict or describe
future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can generally identify forward-looking statements
as statements containing the words “believe,” “expect,” “will,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “assume” or other similar expressions, or negatives
of those expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. All statements contained or
incorporated by reference in this quarterly report regarding our future strategy, future operations, projected financial position,
estimated future revenues, projected costs, future prospects, the future of our industry and results that might be obtained by
pursuing management’s current plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.
 
You should not place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable
factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available
to us and speak only as of the date on the cover of this quarterly report, or, in the case of forward-looking statements in documents
incorporated by reference, as of the date of the date of the filing of the document that includes the statement. New risks and
uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these matters or how they may affect us. Over time,
our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that
are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such difference might be significant and materially adverse to
our security holders. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward- looking statements or
to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any statements to reflect new information or future events or developments.
 
We have identified some of the important factors
that could cause future events to differ from our current expectations and they are described in this quarterly report under the
caption “Risk Factors,” below, and elsewhere in this quarterly report, which you should review carefully. Please consider
our forward-looking statements in light of those risks as you read this quarterly report.

1.
Nature of Business

 
Sugarmade, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as’‘we’’,
’‘us” or “the/our Company’’) is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware.
Our previous legal name was Diversified Opportunities, Inc. Our Company, Sugarmade, Inc. operates much of its business activities
through our subsidiary, SWC Group, Inc., a California corporation (“SWC’’).
 
Sugarmade, Inc. was founded in 2010. In 2014,
CarryOutSupplies.com was acquired by Sugarmade, Inc., creating the Company as it is today. As of the end of the reporting period,
September 30, 2019, we were involved in two businesses including the supply of products to the quick service restaurant sub-sector
of the restaurant industry and as an importer, distributor and marketer of hydroponic supplies to various agricultural sectors.
We had previously been a marketer of culinary seasoning products Seasoning Stix and Sriracha Seasoning Stix and a marketer of tree-free
paper products. These products were discontinued during 2018 in order to focus the majority of our corporate resources on the marketing
of hydroponic supplies.
 
The marketplace in which we plan to be mainly
engaged is generally referred to as hydroponic agricultural supplies. While some of our customers are engaged in the legal cultivation,
processing and/or distribution of cannabis or cannabis containing products, our Company neither sells any products containing cannabis
nor do we handle, process, or distribute any products containing cannabis.
 
Our legacy business operation, CarryOutSupplies.com,
is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies servicing more than 2,000 quick service restaurants. Our products
include double poly paper cups for cold beverage; disposable, clear, plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups, ice cream
cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, food containers, soup containers, plastic spoons and many other similar products for this market sector.
CarryOutSupplies.com was founded in 2009 when the founders gained first-hand experience within the restaurant industry of the difficulty
for restaurant owners to acquire custom printed supplies at a reasonable cost. Many quick service restaurants wish to acquire custom
printed products, such as those embossed with logos, but the minimum order size for such customization had been cost prohibitive.
With that in mind, carry out supplies was founded to provide products to this underserved section of the market. Since that time,
the company has become a key supplier to many popular U.S. franchises, particularly in the frozen dessert segments.
 
During December 2017, the Company entered into
a master marketing agreement with BizRight, LLC, a leading marketer and manufacturer of hydroponic growth supplies, which offers
a range of hydroponics-related products including: HPS grow lights, electronic ballasts, HPS Bulbs, nutrient mixes, environmental
control products, pH measurement and calibration solutions and other grow and storage products. BizRight operates the ZenHydro.com
website and other e-commerce properties, and sells various products to distributors and retailers. On April 11, 2018, the same
rights under the master marketing agreement were assigned to BZRTH Inc. On February 5, 2019, the Company exercised its option to
acquire BZRTH and the transaction had been closed on October 30, 2019. On January 15, 2020, the Company entered into a Rescission
and Mutual Release Agreement (“Agreement”) with each of the parties agreeing to rescind the transaction and return
all consideration exchanged pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement.
 
In October 2018 and January 2019,
the Company had intents to acquire two suppliers or retailers of hydroponic equipment. As of the date of this report, the Company
is no longer pursuing these acquisitions.

Summary of Significant Accounting

 
Policies Basis of presentation
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes
necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management’s
opinion however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary
for a fair financial statement presentation.
 
These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with our Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019,
which contains our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, for the year ended June 30, 2019. The interim results for the period
ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year.
 
Principles of consolidation
 
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements include the accounts of our Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SWC Group Inc. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Going concern
 
The Company sustained continued losses from
operations during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The Company’s continuation
as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, in which
it has not been successful, and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be required.
 
Our condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Management is endeavoring to increase revenue-generating
operations. While priority is on generating cash from operations through the sale of the Company’s products, management is
also seeking to raise additional working capital through various financing sources, including the sale of the Company’s equity
and/or debt securities, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms to our Company, or which may not be available
at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our business as desired and our
operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on us
and/or our stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating
results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds,
the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our common stock.

Summary of Significant Accounting (continued)

 
Use of estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ significantly from those estimates.
 
Revenue recognition
  
We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC’’) No. 606, Revenue Recognition. Sugarmade
applied a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with
a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation
is satisfied.
 
Substantially
all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer.
  
Cash
 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts
held as bank deposits and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.
 
From time to time, we may maintain bank balances
in interest bearing accounts in excess of the $250,000 currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for interest
bearing accounts (there is currently no insurance limit for deposits in noninterest bearing accounts). We have not experienced
any losses with respect to cash. Management believes our Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to
its cash.
 
Accounts receivable
 
Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated
collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. We grant unsecured credit to our customer’s deemed
credit worthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations
on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance
for doubtful accounts. The Company had accounts receivable net of allowances of $158,000 as of December 31, 2019 and of $218,145
as of June 30, 2019.
 
Inventory
 
Inventory consists of finished goods paper
and paper-based products such as paper cups and food containers ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. We
value our inventory using the weighted average costing method. Our Company’s policy is to include as a part of inventory
any freight incurred to ship the product from our contract manufacturers to our warehouses. Outbound freights costs related to
shipping costs to our customers are considered period costs and reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. We regularly
review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence.

Summary of Significant Accounting (continued)

 
If the estimated realizable value of our inventory
is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated market value. On a consolidated basis,
as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, the balance for the inventory totaled $495,086 and $356,285, respectively. Obsolescence
reserve at December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 were $10,580 and $120,486, respectively.
 
Property and equipment
 
Property and equipment is stated at the historical
cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets for both financial and income tax reporting purposes as follows:
 


Machinery equipment
 
5 years

Furniture and equipment
 
7 years

Vehicles
 
7 years

 
Expenditures for renewals and betterments are
capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations in the year in which they are
incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic
benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset, the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset.
 
Upon sale or disposal of an asset, the historical
cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of such asset were removed from their respective accounts and any gain
or loss is recorded in the statements of income.
 
The Company reviews the carrying value of property,
plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable
from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected
future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating
results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and
other economic factors. Based on this assessment, no impairment expenses for property, plant, and equipment was recorded in operating
expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, which include property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
 
Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held
and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is
generally determined using the asset's expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. Based on
its review, the Company, as of June 30, 2019, performed an impairment test of all of its intangible assets. Based on the company’s
analysis, the company had an amortization of intangible assets of $700 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting (continued)

 
Leases 
 
In February 2016, the FASB established Topic
842, Leases, by issuing ASU No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize the rights and obligations created by leases
on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted
Improvements, ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, and ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient
for Transition to Topic 842. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU
asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance
or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statement of operations.
 
The new standard became effective April 1,
2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of
initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transition
requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date.
The entity must also recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard
for the comparative periods. The Company adopted the new standard on July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach
as of the effective date of the initial application. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition.
The Company elected the “package of practical expedients”, which permits entities not to reassess under the new lease
standard prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company does not expect
to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements.
 
The most significant effects of the adoption
of the new standard relate to the recognition of new ROU assets and lease labilities on our balance sheet for office operating
leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities.
 
The new standard also provides practical
expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company has also elected the short-term leases recognition exemption
for all leases that qualify. This means that the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this
includes not recognizing ROU assets and lease liabilities, for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. The
Company also currently expects to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its
leases. All existing leases are reported under this rule. After the adoption, $455,590 of operating lease right-of-use asset
and $465,826 of operating lease liabilities were not retroactively reflected to June 30, 2019 financial statements, and
$416,421 of operating lease right-of-use asset and $428,907 of operating lease liabilities were reflected to
December 31, 2019 financial statements.
 
Income taxes
 
We account for income taxes under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
 
As a result of the implementation of certain
provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
position, as defined, ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspect of the recognition and measurement
related to accounting for income taxes. We adopted the provisions of ASC 740 as of October 2, 2008, and have analyzed filing positions
in each of the federal and state

Summary of Significant Accounting (continued)

 
jurisdictions where we are required to file
income tax returns, as well as open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified the U.S. federal and California as our
“major” tax jurisdictions and generally, we remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2013 U.S.
federal income tax returns. However, we have certain tax attribute carryforwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment
by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized.
 
We believe that our income tax filing positions
and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial
position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, we did
not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740. Our policy for recording interest and penalties associated
with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes. We have no interest or penalties as of December
31, 2019.
 
Stock based compensation
 
Stock based compensation cost to employees
is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the stock-based award, and will be recognized as expense
over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). We estimate the fair value of employee
stock options granted using the Binomial Option Pricing Model. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options
will include the exercise price of the award, the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, the expected option term,
the risk free interest rate at the date of grant, the expected volatility and the expected annual dividend yield on our common
stock. We use our company’s own data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected forfeiture
rate. Share-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the
services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable.
 
Loss per share	
 
We calculate basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without considering common
stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income or net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents, such as options and warrants. Options and
warrants are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive.
 
Fair value of financial instruments
 
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and
enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs
to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
 
Level 1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted)
for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable
in the marketplace.
Level 3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no
market activity.
 
The Company used Level 3 inputs for its valuation
methodology for the derivative liabilities in determining the fair value using the Binomial option-pricing model for the six months
ended December 31, 2019.

Summary of Significant Accounting (continued)

 
Derivative instruments
 
The fair value of derivative instruments is
recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives liability are recorded in the
consolidated statement of operations under non-operating income (expense).
 
Our Company evaluates all of its financial
instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value
and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted average Binomial option-pricing model to value the
derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including
whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative
instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement
of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
 
Segment Reporting
 
FASB ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting”,
requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the
way a company’s management organizes segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in
which management disaggregates a company.
 
FASB ASC Topic 280 has no effect on the Company’s financial
statements as substantially all of its operations are conducted in one industry segment – paper and paper-based products
such as paper cups, cup lids, food containers, etc.
 
New accounting pronouncements   
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU
asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as
either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into
after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. The Company adopted this ASU on the consolidated financial statements in the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

Concentration

 
Customers
 
For the six months ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, our Company earned net revenues of $1,474,784 and $2,886,885 respectively. The vast majority of these revenues for the
period ending December 31, 2019 were derived from a large number of customers, whereas the vast majority of these revenues for
the period ending December 31, 2018 were derived from a limited number of customers. No customers accounted for over 10% of the
Company’s total revenues for the period ended December 31, 2019.

Equity Transaction - Exclusive License Rights and Acquisition

 
On December 13, 2017, we entered into a Master

Legal Proceedings  

 
From time to time and in the
course of business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief. The amount of
the ultimate liability, if any, from such claims cannot be determined. As of date of this filing, there were no legal claims currently
pending or, to our knowledge, threatened against our Company that, in the opinion of our management, would be likely to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except as follows:

On December 11, 2013, the Company was served
with a complaint from two Convertible Note Holders and investors in the Company, Lovitt & Hannan, Inc. Salary Deferral Plan
FBO J. Thomas Hannan, Attorney at Law 401K Plan and Trust, and Kevin M. Kearney. The Company's former CEO, Scott Lantz, was also
named in the suit. On February 21, 2017, the Company signed a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs. Under the terms of the
settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay the plaintiffs $307,000 to settle all claims against the Company, which included
the payoff of the two notes outstanding within one (1) week. Upon receipt of all payments, plaintiffs will surrender for cancellation
230,000 of the Company's shares within ten (10) days. The parties agreed that all claims against the Company would be satisfied
through such payments and that the matter would be fully resolved. As of June 30, 2018, third-parties had purchased two (2) notes
of approximately $80,000, reducing the Company's exposure by $80,000. As of the date of this filing the balance for accrued legal
settlement for Hannan vs Sugarmade has been reduced to $227,000, plus interest until the date of complete payoff.

 

On August 13, 2019, a lawsuit was filed against
the Company for unpaid legal fees of $50,000.00, which originates from the Company’s former chairman and CEO.  The
Company was served in or around September 2019.  The Company has filed a response to the underlying complaint to preserve
its rights to defend the lawsuit should it become necessary. However, the Company plans to amicably resolve this matter and anticipates
that it will be settled and dismissed.

 
There can be no assurances the ultimate liability relative
to these lawsuits will not exceed what is outlined above.

Property and Equipment, net

 
As of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019,
the property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation expenses were $430,396 and $476,585, respectively.
 
For the six months ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, depreciation expenses amounted to $46,189 and $26,578, respectively.
 
The Company reviews the carrying value of property
and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable
from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected
future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating
results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and
other economic factors. Based on this assessment, no impairment expenses for property, plant, and equipment was recorded in operating
expenses during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We have primarily financed our operations through
the sale of unregistered equity and convertible notes payable. As of December 31, 2019, our Company had cash balance of $103,002,
current assets totaling $3,225,281 and total assets of $4,141,568. We had current and total liabilities totaling $8,280,102 and
$8,598,185, respectively. Stockholders’ equity reflected a deficiency of $4,456,617.
 
The following is a summary of cash provided
by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
 

 
Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities
was $(2,122,441) for the six months ended December 31, 2019, and $1,060,980 for the six months ended December 31, 2018.
 
There were $nil and $87,154 fixed assets and
intangible assets purchased during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 relating to investing activities, respectively.
 
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities
was $2,191,072 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and $(856,278) for the six months ended December 31, 2018.
 
Our capital requirements going forward will
consist of financing our operations until we are able to reach a level of revenues and gross margins adequate to equal or exceed
our ongoing operating expenses. Other than the notes payable discussed above, borrowings from our bank and the production credit
facility with our suppliers, we do not have any credit agreement or source of liquidity immediately available to us.
 
Given estimates of our Company’s future
operating results and our credit arrangements with our suppliers, we are currently forecasting that we will need to secure additional
financing to obtain adequate financial resources to reach profitability. As of the date of this report, we estimate that the cash
necessary to implement our current business plan for the next twelve months is approximately $2,000,000.
 
Based on our need to raise additional funds
to implement our business plans for the next twelve months, we have included a discussion concerning the presentation of our financial
statements on a going concern basis in the notes to our financial statements and our independent public accountants have included
a similar discussion in their opinion on our financial statements through June 30, 2019. We will be required in the near future
to issue debt or sell our Company’s equity securities in order to raise additional cash, although there are no firm arrangements
in place for any such financing at this time. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to secure the necessary
financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur. The failure to secure such financing could severely
curtail our plans for future growth or in more severe scenarios, the continued operations of our Company.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Our current plans do not call for our Company
to expend significant amounts for capital expenditures for the foreseeable future beyond relatively insignificant expenditures
for office furniture and information technology related equipment as we add employees to our Company. We are however continually
evaluating the production processes of our third party contract manufacturers to determine if there are investments we could make
in their processes to achieve manufacturing improvements and significant cost savings. Any such desired investments would require
additional cash above our current forecast requirements.

ITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level
of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives.
 
As required by the Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were
ineffective due to the Company is relatively inexperienced with certain complexities within USGAAP and SEC reporting.
 
We have taken, and are continuing to take,
certain actions to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We plan to hire additional credentialed
professional staff and consulting professionals with greater knowledge and experience of U.S. GAAP and related regulatory requirements
to oversee our financial reporting process in order to ensure our compliance with U.S. GAAP and other relevant securities laws.
In addition, we plan to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on U.S. GAAP, and other regulatory requirements
regarding the preparation of financial statements.
 
Notwithstanding the above identified material
weakness, the Company’s management believes that its condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report
fairly present in all material respects the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this report.
 
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
 
There have not been any changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
