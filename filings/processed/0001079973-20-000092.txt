1.       ORGANIZATION,
NATURE OF BUSINESS, GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S PLANS:
 
Organization and nature of business: 
 
Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc. (“Bion”
or “We” or the “Company”) was incorporated in 1987 in the State of Colorado and has developed and continues
to develop patented and proprietary technology and business models that provide comprehensive environmental solutions to a significant
source of pollution in United States agriculture, large scale livestock facilities known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations
(“CAFO’s”). Application of our technology and technology platform can simultaneously remediate environmental
problems and improve operational/resource efficiencies by recovering value from the CAFOs’ waste stream that has traditionally
been wasted or underutilized, including renewable energy, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)--- in organic and conventional form--
and clean water. Bion’s technologies (and applications related thereto) produce substantial reductions of nutrient releases
(primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) to both water and air (including ammonia, which is subsequently re-deposited to the ground)
from livestock waste streams based upon our operations and research to date (and third-party peer review thereof). Our technology
simultaneously enables the documentation of the remediation efforts thereby providing the basis for product branding which addresses
consumer concerns regarding sustainability and food safety. We are continually involved in research and development to upgrade
and improve our technology and technology applications, including integration with third party technology.
 
Additionally, Bion’s patented and propriety
technology can provide comprehensive and cost-effective treatment of livestock waste onsite (and/or at nearby locations) while
it is still concentrated and before it contaminates air, soil, groundwater aquifers and/or downstream waters, and, in certain configurations,
can be optimized to maximize recovery of marketable nutrients for potential use as fertilizer (organic and/or inorganic) and/or
feed additives plus renewable energy (and related environmental credits).
 
From 2014 through the current 2020 fiscal year,
the Company has focused its research and development on augmenting the basic ‘separate and aggregate’ approach of its
technology platform to provide additional flexibility and to increase recovery of marketable nutrient by-products (in organic and
non-organic forms) and renewable energy production (either/both biogas and/or renewable electricity), thereby increasing potential
related revenue streams and reducing dependence of its future projects on the monetization of nutrient reductions (which still
remain an important part of project revenue streams). Bion has worked on development of its third generation technology (“3G
Tech”) which is designed to: a) generate significantly greater value from the nutrients and renewable energy recovered from
the waste stream, b) treat dry (poultry) waste streams as well as wet waste streams (dairy/beef cattle/swine) while c) maintaining
or improving environmental performance. This research and development effort also involves ongoing review of potential “add-ons”
and applications to our technology platform for use in different regulatory and/or climate environments. These research and development
activities have targeted completion of development of the next generation of Bion’s technology and technology platform. We
believe such activities will continue at least through the 2020 fiscal year (and likely longer), subject to availability of adequate
financing for the Company’s operations, of which there is no assurance. Such activities may include design and construction
of an initial, commercial-scale module utilizing our 3G Tech to assist in optimization efforts before construction of the full
Kreider 2 project (see below) and other Projects.
 
The Company’s efforts have also focused
on development of business models which can facilitate the implementation of its technologies and technology platform in manners
which can increase decrease the ‘environmental footprint’ of enterprises which implement our technology while increasing
the sustainability and potential economic returns.

For the past decade, Bion has been directed
toward creating applications of our patented and proprietary waste management technologies and technology platform to pursue JVs
in three main business opportunities:
 

1)Installation of Bion systems to retrofit and environmentally remediate existing large CAFOs (“Retrofits”
and “Retrofit Projects”) in selected markets where:
 
a) government policy supports such
efforts (such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Great Lakes Basin states, and/or other states and watersheds facing EPA ‘total
maximum daily load’ (“TMDL”) issues), and/or
 
b) CAFO’s need our technology
to obtain permits to expand or develop without negative environmental consequences.
 

2)Development of new state-of-the-art large scale waste treatment facilities (now utilizing the Company’s
3G Tech) which may be developed in conjunction with new CAFOs in strategic locations that were previously impracticable due to
environmental impacts or to treat the waste streams from one or more existing large livestock facilities (“Projects”).
Some of these Projects may be either a) Integrated Projects as described below, b) ‘central processing facilities’
which receive the waste from multiple livestock facilities, c) Retrofit Projects or d) hybrids with elements of each of these types.
Each version will be able to realize revenue from multiple revenue streams potentially generated by our 3G Tech.
 

3)Licensing and/or joint venturing of Bion’s technology and applications (primarily) outside
North America.
 
In both categories 1) and 2) above, the Company
intends to directly participate (whether by joint venture agreement or other contractual arrangements) in the revenues of the Retrofits
and Projects.
 
The opportunities described at 1) and 2) above
each require substantial political and regulatory (federal, state and local) efforts on the part of the Company and a substantial
part of Bion’s efforts are focused on such political and regulatory matters. Bion currently intends to pursue the international
opportunities primarily through the use of consultants with existing relationships in target countries. At this time, our primary
focus is on category 2) above using our 3G Tech to develop new (or expanded) large-scale Projects with strategic partners (including
the Kreider 2 Project) on a joint venture (or other participating contractual form) basis. Bion’s business model opens up
the opportunity for JV’s in various forms based upon the revenue generated by our 3G Tech platform from nutrient reductions,
fertilizer co-products and renewable natural gas (which revenue streams will be secured through long term take-off agreements for
each of these co-products) providing initial support for financing of required capital expenditures (whether equity or debt).We
anticipate that these revenue streams will be supplemented by revenue realized from long-term premium pricing resulting from the
sustainable branding opportunity. We believe that the branding opportunity may provide the single largest contribution to the economic
opportunity over time.

During 2008 the Company commenced actively
pursuing the opportunity presented by environmental retrofit and remediation of the waste streams of existing CAFOs which effort
has met with very limited success to date. The first commercial activity in this area is represented by our agreement with Kreider
Farms (“KF”), pursuant to which the Kreider 1 system to treat KF's dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases
to the environment while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy was designed, constructed and entered full-scale
operation during 2011. On January 26, 2009 the Board of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (“Pennvest”)
approved a $7.75 million loan to Bion PA 1, LLC (“PA1”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the initial
Kreider Farms project (“Kreider 1 System”). PA1 has had sporadic discussions/negotiations with Pennvest related to
forbearance and/or re-structuring its obligations pursuant to the Pennvest Loan for more than five years. In the context of such
discussions/negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally,
the Company has not made any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore, the Company has classified
the Pennvest Loan as a current liability as of December 31, 2019. Due to the failure of the Pennsylvania nutrient reduction credit
market to develop, the Company determined (on three separate occasions) that the carrying amount of the property and equipment
related to the Kreider 1 System exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows based on certain assumptions regarding timing,
level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits. Therefore, PA1 and the Company recorded impairments
related to the value of the Kreider 1 assets totaling $3,750,000 through June 30, 2015. During the 2016 fiscal year, PA1 and the
Company recorded an additional impairment of $1,684,562 to the value of the Kreider 1 assets which reduced the value on the Company’s
books to zero. This impairment reflects management’s judgment that the salvage value of the Kreider 1 assets roughly equals
PA1’s contractual obligations related to the Kreider 1 System, including expenses related to decommissioning of the Kreider
1 System, costs associated with needed capital upgrade expenses, and re-certification/ permitting amendments.
 
On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised its
right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal,
interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make
the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest
rejected PA1’s proposal made during the fall of 2014. No formal proposals are presently under consideration and only sporadic
communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the last 5 years. It is not possible at this date to predict
the outcome of such this matter, but the Company believes that a loan modification agreement (coupled with an agreement regarding
an update and re-start of full operations of the Kreider 1 System) may be reached in the future if/when a more robust market for
nutrient reductions develops in Pennsylvania, of which there is no assurance. PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various options
with regard to Kreider 1 over the next 180 days.
 
During August 2012, the Company provided Pennvest
(and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 System met the ‘technology guaranty’ standards which
were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan has been (and is now) solely an obligation
of PA1 since that date.
 
The economics (potential revenues, profitability
and continued operation) of the Kreider 1 System are based almost entirely on the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus)
reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up.
 
On May 5, 2016, Bion PA2 LLC (“PA2”)
executed a stand-alone joint venture agreement with Kreider Farms covering matters related to development and operation of a system
to treat the waste streams from Kreider’s poultry facilities (“Kreider 2”).
 
The Kreider projects are owned and operated
by Bion through separate subsidiaries, in which Kreider has the option to acquire a noncontrolling interest. Substantial capital
(equity and/or debt) has been and will continue to be expended on these projects. Additional funds will be required for continuing
operations and additional capital expenditures for upgrades at Kreider 1 until sufficient revenues can be generated, of which there
is no assurance. The Company anticipates that the Kreider 1 System will generate revenue primarily from the sale of nutrient reduction
(and/or other) environmental credits. A portion of Bion’s research and development activities has taken place at the Kreider
1 facility.

Kreider Farms – 3G Tech Project
 
Bion is completing an envelope of policy change
and technology pilots that will allow it to move forward with a commercial large scale 3G Tech project at Kreider Farms. Having
recently received a Notice of Allowance of the initial 3G Tech patent (and subsequent filings and approvals of related additional
patent applications/continuations), Bion is focused on two key tasks during the first half of the 2020 calendar year that will
‘complete the envelope’ and allow Bion to launch active development of the Kreider 2 poultry project (and/or other
Projects) later in 2020:
 
1. Support for adoption of PA SB 575 (successor to SB
799): This will create a competitively-bid market for nutrient reductions/Credits that we believe will provide support for project
financing for Kreider 2 prior to development of markets for the coproducts from Kreider 2 are established.
 
2. Installation of a small-scale 3G Tech ammonia recovery
system to produce ammonium bicarbonate to be used to make application to OMRI for organic certification (and possibly for grower
trials).
 
The 3G Tech Kreider 2 Project is planned for
two (or more) locations. It is intended to treat the waste from Kreider’s 1,800 dairy cows and approximately six million
egg layer chickens (with capacity for an additional three million layers). The Kreider 2 Project will be designed with modules
with capacity of 450 tons (or more) per day of waste and will remove nitrogen and phosphorus from the waste stream that will be
converted into high-value coproducts instead of polluting local and downstream waters. The Kreider 2 Project is planned to be built
in three phases and may be expanded to include a ‘central processing facility’ with modules that will accept transported
waste from the region on fee basis.
 
Bion has a long-standing relationship with
Kreider Farms including a 2016 joint venture agreement related to this facility. Kreider has already made a significant investment
in upgrading its poultry facilities to maximize the treatment and recovery efficiencies that can be achieved with Bion’s
technology. We are cautiously optimistic that once PA SB575 (the recently introduced successor to SB799) will be passed during
the current fiscal year, a market will be put in place for long-term commercial sale of the nutrient reduction credits produced
at Kreider 2. Bion anticipates that it may require up to 6 months after SB575 becomes law to develop the rules/regulations related
to the competitive bidding program. If the competitive bidding program is implemented, we intend to arrange project financing for
the Kreider 2 Project during 2020.
 
Assuming there are positive developments related
to the market for nutrient reductions in Pennsylvania, the Company intends to pursue development, design and construction of the
Kreider 2 poultry waste/renewable energy project with a goal of achieving operational status for its initial modules during late
2020 or the first half of 2021. However, as discussed above, this Project faces challenges related to the current limits of the
existing nutrient reduction market and funding of technology-based, verifiable agricultural nutrient reductions which are anticipated
to constitute the largest share of its revenues.
 
Bion’s current long-term goal is to acquire or develop, or
have in a development pipeline, 6 to 12 Projects over the next 36 to 48 months.
 
A significant portion of Bion’s activities
concern efforts with private and public stakeholders (at local and state level) in Pennsylvania (and other Chesapeake Bay and Midwest
and Great Lakes states) and at the federal level EPA and the Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) (and other executive
departments) and Congress) to establish appropriate public policies which will create regulations and funding mechanisms that foster
installation of the low cost environmental solutions that Bion (and others) can provide through clean-up of agricultural waste
streams. The Company anticipates that such efforts will continue in Pennsylvania and other Chesapeake Bay watershed states throughout
the next 12 months and in various additional states thereafter.

Going concern and management’s plans:
 
The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated significant revenues and has
incurred net losses (including significant non-cash expenses) of approximately $2,659,000 and $3,018,000 during the years ended
June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a net loss of approximately $1,207,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2019, the Company has a working capital deficit and a stockholders’ deficit of approximately $10,247,000
and $14,817,000, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. The following paragraphs describe management’s plans with regard to these conditions.
 
The Company continues to explore sources of
additional financing (including potential agreements with strategic partners – both financial and ag-industry) to satisfy
its current and future operating and capital expenditure requirements as it is not currently generating any significant revenues.
 
During the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018,
the Company received total proceeds of approximately $897,000 and $418,000 from the sale of its debt and equity securities. Proceeds
during the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years have been lower than in earlier years which reduction has negatively impacted the Company’s
business development efforts.
 
During the six months ended December 31, 2019,
the Company received total proceeds of approximately $977,000 from the sale of its equity securities and paid approximately $87,000
in commissions.
 
During fiscal years 2019 and 2018 and the first
half of the fiscal year 2020, the Company continued to experience difficulty in raising equity funding. As a result, the Company
faced, and continues to face, significant cash flow management challenges due to working capital constraints. To partially mitigate
these working capital constraints, the Company’s core senior management and several key employees and consultants have been
deferring (and continue to defer) all or part of their cash compensation and/or are accepting compensation in the form of securities
of the Company (Notes 5 and 7) and members of the Company’s senior management have made loans to the Company (Note 4). During
the year ended June 30, 2018, senior management and certain core employees and consultants agreed to a one-time extinguishment
of liabilities owed by the Company which in aggregate totaled $2,404,000. Additionally, the Company made reductions in its personnel
during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2015 and again during the year ended June 30, 2018. The constraint on available resources
has had, and continues to have, negative effects on the pace and scope of the Company’s efforts to develop its business.
The Company has had to delay payment of trade obligations and has had to economize in many ways that have potentially negative
consequences. If the Company does not have greater success in its efforts to raise needed funds during the remainder of the current
fiscal year (and subsequent periods), management will need to consider deeper cuts (including additional personnel cuts) and curtailment
of operations (including possibly Kreider 1 operations) and/or research and development activities.
 
The Company will need to obtain additional
capital to fund its operations and technology development, to satisfy existing creditors, to develop Projects (including Integrated
Projects and the Kreider 2 facility) and CAFO Retrofit waste remediation systems and to continue to operate the Kreider 1 facility.
The Company anticipates that it will seek to raise from $2,500,000 to $50,000,000 or more debt and/or equity through joint ventures,
strategic partnerships and/or sale of its equity securities (common, preferred and/or hybrid) and/or debt (including convertible)
securities, and/or through use of ‘rights’ and/or warrants (new and/or existing) during the next twelve months. However,
as discussed above, there is no assurance, especially in light of the difficulties the Company has experienced in recent periods
and the extremely unsettled capital markets that presently exist (especially for companies like us), that the Company will be able
to obtain the funds that it needs to stay in business, complete its technology development or to successfully develop its business
and Projects.
 
There is no realistic likelihood that funds
required during the next twelve months (or in the periods immediately thereafter) for the Company’s basic operations and/or
proposed Projects will be generated from operations. Therefore, the Company will need to raise sufficient funds from external sources
such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of sufficient additional capital resulting from the inability
to generate cash flow from operations and/or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail
or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Further, there can be no assurance that
any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significantly dilutive
effect on the Company’s existing shareholders. All of these factors have been exacerbated by the extremely limited and unsettled
credit and capital markets presently existing for small companies like Bion.

2.       SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Principles of consolidation:
 
The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bion Integrated Projects Group, Inc. (“Projects Group”),
Bion Technologies, Inc., BionSoil, Inc., Bion Services, PA1, and PA2; and its 58.9% owned subsidiary, Centerpoint Corporation (“Centerpoint”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring entries) that, in the opinion
of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2019, and the results of operations and cash
flows of the Company for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Operating results for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2020.
 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
 
Property and equipment:
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost and
are depreciated, when placed into service, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
generally three to twenty years. The Company capitalizes all direct costs and all indirect incrementally identifiable costs related
to the design and construction of its Integrated Projects. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would
be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, and
is recognized as a loss from operations.
 
Stock-based compensation:
 
The Company follows the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, which generally requires that share-based compensation transactions be accounted
and recognized in the statement of operations based upon their grant date fair values.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments: 
 
Pursuant to ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives
and Hedging” (“Topic 815”), the Company reviews all financial instruments for the existence of features which
may require fair value accounting and a related mark-to-market adjustment at each reporting period end. Once determined, the Company
assesses these instruments as derivative liabilities. The fair value of these instruments is adjusted to reflect the fair value
at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment
to fair value of derivatives.
 
Warrants:
 
The Company has issued warrants to purchase
common shares of the Company. Warrants are valued using a fair value based method, whereby the fair value of the warrant is determined
at the warrant issue date using a market-based option valuation model based on factors including an evaluation of the Company’s
value as of the date of the issuance, consideration of the Company’s limited liquid resources and business prospects, the
market price of the Company’s stock in its mostly inactive public market and the historical valuations and purchases of the
Company’s warrants. When warrants are issued in combination with debt or equity securities, the warrants are valued and accounted
for based on the relative fair value of the warrants in relation to the total value assigned to the debt or equity securities and
warrants combined.
 


14  
 

 
 
Concentrations of credit risk:
 
The Company's financial instruments that are
exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash. The Company's cash is in demand deposit accounts placed with federally
insured financial institutions and selected brokerage accounts. Such deposit accounts at times may exceed federally insured limits.
The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.
 
Noncontrolling interests:
 
In accordance with ASC 810, “Consolidation”,
the Company separately classifies noncontrolling interests within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and separately
reports the amounts attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition,
the noncontrolling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling
interest balance.
 
Fair value measurements:
 
Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date in the principal or most advantageous market. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that has three levels of inputs, both
observable and unobservable, with use of the lowest possible level of input to determine fair value.
 
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
Level 2 – observable inputs other than
Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities
in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable;
and
 
Level 3 – assets and liabilities whose
significant value drivers are unobservable.
 
Observable inputs are based on market data
obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s market assumptions. Unobservable
inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may
fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified
using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management
judgment.
 
The fair value of cash and accounts payable
approximates their carrying amounts due to their short-term maturities. The fair value of the loan payable is indeterminable at
this time due to the nature of the arrangement with a state agency and the fact that it is in default. The fair value of the redeemable
preferred stock approximates its carrying value due to the dividends accrued on the preferred stock which are reflected as part
of the redemption value. The fair value of the deferred compensation, loans payable - affiliates and convertible notes payable
- affiliates are not practicable to estimate due to the related party nature of the underlying transactions.
 
Revenue Recognition:

Loss per share:
 
Basic loss per share amounts are calculated
using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share assumes the conversion,
exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments, such as options or warrants, unless the effect is to reduce the
loss per share or increase the earnings per share. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the basic
and diluted loss per share was the same, as the impact of potential dilutive common shares was anti-dilutive.
 
The following table represents the warrants,
options and convertible securities excluded from the calculation of basic loss per share:
 

 
The following is a reconciliation of the denominators
of the basic and diluted loss per share computations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
 

 
Use of estimates:
 
In preparing the Company’s consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
 
The Company continually assesses any new accounting
pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s
financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of the change to its financial statements and
assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s financial statements properly reflect the
change.
 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
“Compensation – Stock Compensation – Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting” to simplify
the accounting for share based payments granted to nonemployees and was adopted by the Company effective July 1, 2019. Under this
guidance, payments to nonemployees is aligned with the requirements for share based payments granted to employees. The adoption
of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements as previously issued share-based payments
to nonemployees had already reached a measurement date.

COMPENSATION:
The Company owes deferred compensation
to various employees, former employees and consultants totaling $537,119 and $698,766 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Included in the deferred compensation balances as of December 31, 2019, are $49,318 and nil owed Bassani and Smith respectively,
pursuant to extension agreements effective January 1, 2015, whereby unpaid compensation earned after January 1, 2015, accrues
interest at 4% per annum and can be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock at the election of the employee
during the first five calendar days of any month. The conversion price shall be the average closing price of the Company’s

of their respective deferred compensation into their January 2015 Convertible Notes (Note 7). In connection with the agreements
related to Smith’s December 31, 2019 transfer, Smith received the right to transfer future deferred compensation to his
January 2015 Convertible Note at his election, The Company also owes a former employee $72,500, which is not convertible and is
non-interest bearing.

6.       LOAN PAYABLE:
 
PA1, the Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, owes $9,444,576 as of December 31, 2019 under the terms of the Pennvest Loan related to the construction of the Kreider
1 System including accrued interest and late charges totaling $1,690,576 as of December 31, 2019. The terms of the Pennvest Loan
provided for funding of up to $7,754,000 which was to be repaid by interest-only payments for three years, followed by an additional
ten-year amortization of principal. The Pennvest Loan accrues interest at 2.547% per annum for years 1 through 5 and 3.184% per
annum for years 6 through maturity. The Pennvest Loan required minimum annual principal payments of approximately $4,273,000 in
fiscal years 2013 through 2019, and $794,000 in fiscal year 2020, $819,000 in fiscal year 2021, $846,000 in fiscal year 2022,
$873,000 in fiscal year 2023 and $149,000 in fiscal year 2024. The Pennvest Loan is collateralized by the Kreider 1 System and
by a pledge of all revenues generated from Kreider 1 including, but not limited to, revenues generated from nutrient reduction
credit sales and by-product sales. In addition, in consideration for the excess credit risk associated with the project, Pennvest
is entitled to participate in the profits from Kreider 1 calculated on a net cash flow basis, as defined. The Company has incurred
interest expense related to the Pennvest Loan of $61,722 and $60,408 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company has incurred interest expense related to the Pennvest Loan of $123,444 and $113,747 for the six months ended December
31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Based on the limited development of the depth and breadth of the Pennsylvania nutrient reduction
credit market to date, PA1 commenced negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring the obligations under
the Pennvest Loan. In the context of such negotiations, PA1 has elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest
Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the Company has not made any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and,
therefore, the Company has classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability as of December 31, 2019.
On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised
its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and has accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal,
interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make
the payment demanded by Pennvest. PA1 has engaged in on/off discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter
but no such discussions/negotiations are currently active. As of the date of this report, no formal proposals are presently under
consideration and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the past 5 years. It is not
possible at this date to predict the outcome of this matter, but the Company believes it is possible that an agreement may yet
be reached that will result in a viable loan modification. Subject to the results of the negotiations with Pennvest and pending
development of a more robust market for nutrient reductions in Pennsylvania, PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various options
with regard to Kreider 1 over the next 180 days.
In connection with the Pennvest Loan financing
documents, the Company provided a ‘technology guaranty’ regarding nutrient reduction performance of Kreider 1 which
was structured to expire when Kreider 1’s nutrient reduction performance had been demonstrated. During August 2012 the Company
provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 System had surpassed the requisite performance criteria
and that the Company’s ‘technology guaranty’ was met. As a result, the Pennvest Loan is solely an obligation
of PA1.
 
7.       CONVERTIBLE NOTES
PAYABLE - AFFILIATES: 
 
January 2015 Convertible Notes
 
The January 2015 Convertible Notes accrue interest
at 4% per annum and effective September 30, 2018 are due and payable on July 1, 2021. The January 2015 Convertible Notes (including
accrued interest, plus all future deferred compensation), are convertible, at the sole election of the noteholder, into Units consisting
of one share of the Company’s common stock and one half warrant to purchase a share of the Company’s common stock,
at a price of $0.50 per Unit until December 31, 2020. The warrant contained in the Unit shall be exercisable at $1.00 per share
until December 31, 2020. The original conversion price of $0.50 per Unit approximated the fair value of the Units at the date of
the agreements; therefore, no beneficial conversion feature exists. Management evaluated the terms and conditions of the embedded
conversion features based on the guidance of ASC 815-15 “Embedded Derivatives” to determine if there was an embedded
derivative requiring bifurcation. An embedded derivative instrument (such as a conversion option embedded in the deferred compensation)
must be bifurcated from its host instruments and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument only if the “risks and
rewards” of the embedded derivative instrument are not “clearly and closely related” to the risks and rewards
of the host instrument in which it is embedded. Management concluded that the embedded conversion feature of the deferred compensation
was not required to be bifurcated because the conversion feature is clearly and closely related to the host instrument, and because
of the Company’s limited trading volume that indicates the feature is not readily convertible to cash in accordance with
ASC 815-10, “Derivatives and Hedging”.

notes of $300,000 and $30,000 from Bassani and Smith, respectively, both of which are secured by portions of their January 2015
Convertible Notes (Note 9). The promissory notes accrue interest at 4% per annum and as of December 31, 2019 the accrued interest

during the year ended June 30, 2019 the maturity dates were extended to July 1, 2021, and may be converted at the sole election
of the noteholders into restricted common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $0.60 per share. As the conversion price
of $0.60 approximated the fair value of the common shares at the date of the September 2015 Convertible Notes, no beneficial conversion
feature exists. During the year ended June 30, 2018, Bassani and the Company agreed to split his original September 2015 Convertible
Note into two replacement notes with all the terms remaining the same. One of the replacement notes’ original principal is
$130,000, which is being held by the Company as collateral for a subscription receivable promissory note from Bassani. During the

Note accrues interest at 4% per annum and is due and payable on May 31, 2021 and as of December 31, 2019 the 2019 Convertible Note
and accrued interest was $153,750. The 2019 Convertible Note (including accrued interest), is convertible, at the sole election
of the noteholder, into Units consisting of one share of the Company’s common stock and one-half warrant to purchase a share
of the Company’s common stock, at an initial price of $0.50 per Unit. The warrant contained in the Unit shall be exercisable
at $0.75 per share until December 31, 2021. The original conversion price of $0.50 per Unit approximated the fair value of the
Units at the date of the agreements; therefore, no beneficial conversion feature exists. The Company recorded interest expense
of $1,482 and nil for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recorded interest expense of

21  
 

 
The expected volatility was based on the historical
price volatility of the Company’s common stock. The dividend yield represents the Company’s anticipated cash dividend
on common stock over the expected term of the stock options. The U.S. Treasury bill rate for the expected term of the stock options
was utilized to determine the risk-free interest rate. The expected term of stock options represents the period of time the stock
options granted are expected to be outstanding based upon management’s estimates.

$0.75 per share, until March 15, 2018 (which was expanded on April 27, 2017 to the right to convert up to $300,000 of his deferred
compensation, at his sole election, at $0.75 per share, and subsequently extended until December 31, 2019), and iii) the right
to convert his deferred compensation in whole or in part, at his sole election, at any time in any amount at “market”
or into securities sold in the Company’s current/most recent private offering at the price of such offering to third parties.
Smith agreed effective July 29, 2018 to continue to serve the Company under these terms.
 
Since March 31, 2005, the Company has had various
agreements with Brightcap and/or Bassani, through which the services of Bassani are provided (any reference to Brightcap or Bassani
for all purposes are the same individual). The Board appointed Bassani as the Company's CEO effective May 13, 2011. On February
10, 2015, the Company executed an Extension Agreement with Bassani pursuant to which Bassani extended the term of his service to
the Company to December 31, 2017, (with the Company having an option to extend the term an additional six months.) Pursuant to
the Extension Agreement, Bassani continued to defer his cash compensation ($31,000 per month) until the Board of Directors re-instates
cash payments to all employees and consultants who are deferring their compensation. During October 2016 Bassani was granted the
right to convert up to $125,000 of his deferred compensation, at his sole election, at $0.75 per share, until March 15, 2018 (which
was expanded on April 27, 2017 to the right to convert up to $300,000 of his deferred compensation, at his sole election, at $0.75
per share, and subsequently extended until December 31, 2019). During February 2018, the Company agreed to the material terms for
a binding two-year extension agreement for Bassani’s services as CEO, while a detailed, fully executed agreement is still
being negotiated and will be finalized in the future. Bassani’s salary will remain $372,000 per year, which will continue
to be accrued until there is adequate cash available while negotiations proceed toward the re-instatement of a least a partial
cash payment. Additionally, the Company has agreed to pay him $2,000 per month to be applied to life insurance premiums. On August
1, 2018, in the context of extending his agreement to provide services to the Company on a full time basis through December 31,
2022) plus 2 years after that on a part-time basis, the Company received an interest bearing secured promissory note for $300,000
from Bassani as consideration to purchase warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock,
which warrants are exercisable at $0.60 and have expiry dates of June 30, 2025. The promissory note is secured by Bassani’s
$300,000 of January 2015 Convertible Note (Note 7) and as of December 31, 2019, the accrued interest was $16,964.
 
Execution/exercise bonuses:
 
As part of agreements the Company entered into
with Bassani and Smith effective May 15, 2013, they were each granted the following: a) a 50% execution/exercise bonus which shall
be applied upon the effective date of the notice of intent to exercise (for options and warrants) or issuance event, as applicable,
of any currently outstanding and/or subsequently acquired options, warrants and/or contingent stock bonuses owned by each (and/or
their donees) as follows: i) in the case of exercise by payment of cash, the bonus shall take the form of reduction of the exercise
price; ii) in the case of cashless exercise, the bonus shall be applied to reduce the exercise price prior to the cashless exercise
calculations; and iii) with regard to contingent stock bonuses, issuance shall be triggered upon the Company’s common stock
reaching a closing price equal to 50% of currently specified price; and b) the right to extend the exercise period of all or part
of the applicable options and warrants for up to five years (one year at a time) by annual payments of $.05 per option or warrant
to the Company on or before a date during the three months prior to expiration of the exercise period at least three business days
before the end of the expiration period. Effective January 1, 2016 such annual payments to extend warrant exercise periods have
been reduced to $.01 per option or warrant.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2014, the Company
extended 50% execution/exercise bonuses with the same terms as described above to Schafer and to Jon Northrop (“Northrop”),
the Company’s other board member.
 


24  
 

 
 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company
extended 50% execution/exercise bonuses with the same terms as described above to all options and warrants issued prior to November
7, 2017, to an employee and two former employees who are now consultants.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company
increased the above 50% execution/exercise bonus on all outstanding options and warrants owned or acquired in the future by Bassani,
Smith and Schafer to 75% (to the extent such existing exercise bonus is less than 75%).
 
During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company
approved the right to extend the exercise period of all or part of any options or warrants granted in the past or in the future,
for up to five years (one year at a time) by annual payments of $0.01 per option/warrant for one of its employees. The extension
payment may be made in i) cash; ii) by reduction of sums owed by the Company, and iii) by reduction of applicable exercise bonuses.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the execution/exercise
bonuses ranging from 50-90% were applicable to 7,604,600 of the Company’s outstanding options and 12,175,411 of the Company’s
outstanding warrants.
 
Litigation:
 
On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised its
right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and has accelerated the Pennvest Loan and has demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal,
interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and did not then and does not now have
the resources to make the payment demanded by Pennvest. During August 2012, the Company provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with
data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the ‘technology guaranty’ standards which were incorporated in the
Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan is now solely an obligation of PA1. No litigation has commenced
related to this matter but such litigation is likely if negotiations do not produce a resolution (Note 1 and Note 6).
 
The Company currently is not involved in any other material litigation.
 
11.       RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
 
The Coalition for Affordable Bay Solutions
(“CABS”), a not-for-profit organization that engages in political and legislative lobbying and educational activities
regarding the competitive bidding procurement and nutrient credit trading program in Pennsylvania (and elsewhere), shares certain
key management members with the Company.
 
During the three months ended December 30,
2019 and 2018, respectively, the Company received nil for expense reimbursements from CABS, respectively, while the Company received
nil and $30,000 for expense reimbursements from CABS during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During
the three and six months ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid CABS $26,920 and $39,820, respectively for consulting expenses.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, the Company paid CABS nil for both periods. The Company also issued 16,000

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
From 2014 through the current fiscal year,
the Company has focused its research and development activities toward development of our 3G Tech, augmenting the basic ‘separate
and aggregate’ approach of its technology platform to provide additional flexibility and to increase recovery of nutrient
co-products (in organic and non-organic forms) and renewable energy production (either/both biogas and/or renewable electricity
and related credits), thereby increasing potential related revenue streams and reducing dependence of its future projects on the
monetization of nutrient reductions (which still remain an important part of project revenue streams). This research and development
effort also involves ongoing review of potential “add-ons” and applications to our technology platform for use in different
regulatory and/or climate environments. These research and development activities continued through the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years
with increased focus on recovery of marketable ‘coproducts’ (including nutrients and renewable natural gas) and completion
of development of Bion’s 3G Tech and technology platform. We believe such activities will continue at least through the 2020
calendar year (and likely longer), subject to availability of adequate financing for the Company’s operations, of which there
is no assurance. Such activities may include the design and construction of an initial, commercial-scale module utilizing our 3G
Tech to assist in optimization efforts before construction of the full Kreider 2 project (see below).
Bion’s 3G Tech and technology platform
are designed to capture four revenue streams under one umbrella and provide the basis for joint ventures between the Company and
larger livestock producers seeking to produce environmental/sustainable product lines. The revenue streams are: a) renewable energy
and associated greenhouse gas credits (including US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and/or Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits),
b) verified nutrient reductions (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) that can be used as qualified offsets to the federal Chesapeake
Bay mandate and US EPA TMDL (‘total maximum daily limit’) requirements, c) co-products consisting of high value fertilizer
that Bion believes will achieve certification for use in organic food production for human consumption during the current fiscal
year, and d) an environmentally sustainable USDA certification that will be incorporated into a “brand” that can address
the consumer concerns regarding food safety and sustainability (based on incorporation of all of the third party verified data
for greenhouse gas reductions, nutrient reductions and fertilizer products into a digital register). The “branding”
opportunity will offer large scale livestock producer / processor / distributors of livestock products the opportunity to differentiate
and identify their products in the marketplace and, thereby creates the opportunity to achieve “premium pricing” by
addressing consumer concerns related to safety and sustainability in a manner similar to the premiums achieved by organic producers.
 


27  
 

 
Operational results from the initial commercial
system (utilizing our 2G Tech) confirmed the ability of Bion’s technologies to meet nutrient reduction goals at commercial
scale for an extended period of operation. Bion’s 3G Tech platform (and the new variations under development) center on its
patented and proprietary processes that separate and aggregate the various assets in the CAFO waste stream so they become benign,
stable and/or transportable. Bion systems can: a) remove up to 95% of the nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) in the
effluent, b) reduce greenhouse gases by 90% (or more) including elimination of virtually all ammonia emissions, c) while materially
reducing pathogens, antibiotics and hormones in the livestock waste stream. Our core technology and its primary CAFO applications
are now proven in commercial operations. It has been accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other
regulatory agencies and it is protected by Bion’s portfolio of U.S. and international patents (both issued and applied for).
Currently, our research and development
activities are underway to improve, update and commercialization of our 3G Tech systems (which is ready to be implemented) during
the current fiscal year to meet the needs of CAFOs in various geographic and climate areas with nutrient release constraints and
to increase the recovery and generation of valuable by-products while adding the capability to treat dry (poultry) waste streams
in addition to wet manure streams at lower capital costs and operating costs
Bion is focused on using applications of
its patented and proprietary waste management technologies and technology platform to pursue three main business opportunities:
1) development of new state-of-the-art large-scale waste treatment facilities in joint ventures with large CAFO’s (and other
agricultural industry parties) in strategic locations (“Projects”) ( some of these may be Integrated Projects) with
multiple revenue streams; 2) installation of Bion systems ( some of which may generate verified nutrient reduction credits and
revenues from the production of renewable energy and coproducts) to retrofit and environmentally remediate existing large scale
CAFOs (“Retrofits”) in selected markets where: a) government policy supports such efforts (such as the Chesapeake Bay
watershed, some Great Lakes Basin states, and/or other states and watersheds facing EPA ‘total maximum daily load’
(“TMDL”) issues, and/or b) where CAFO’s need our technology to obtain permits to expand or develop without negative
environmental consequences; and 3) licensing and/or joint venturing of Bion’s technology and applications (primarily) outside
North America. The opportunities described at 1) and 2) above each require substantial political and regulatory (federal, state
and local) efforts on the part of the Company and a substantial part of Bion’s efforts are focused on such political and
regulatory matters. Bion intends to pursue international opportunities primarily through the use of consultants with existing relationships
in target locations. The most intense focus is currently on the requirements for the clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay, on CAFO projects
in the mid-west involving various species, and the potential use of Bion’s technology and technology platform on CAFOs to
remediate ammonia release (and re-deposition to the ground and water) and as an alternative to what the Company believes is far
more expensive nutrient removal downstream in storm water and other projects.
 


28  
 

 
During 2008 the Company commenced actively
pursuing the opportunity presented by environmental retrofit and remediation of the waste streams of existing CAFOs which effort
has met with very limited success to date. The first commercial activity in this area is represented by our agreement with Kreider
Farms (“KF”), pursuant to which the Kreider 1 system to treat KF's dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases
to the environment while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy was designed, constructed and entered full-scale
operation during 2011. On January 26, 2009 the Board of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (“Pennvest”)
approved a $7.75 million loan to Bion PA 1, LLC (“PA1”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the initial
Kreider Farms project (“Kreider 1 System”). After substantial unanticipated delays, on August 12, 2010 PA1 received
a permit for construction of the Kreider 1 System. Construction activities commenced during November 2010. The closing/settlement
of the Pennvest Loan took place on November 3, 2010. PA1 finished the construction of the Kreider 1 System and entered a period
of system ‘operational shakedown’ during May 2011. The Kreider 1 System reached full, stabilized operation by the end
of the 2012 fiscal year. During 2011 the PADEP re-certified the nutrient credits for this project. The PADEP issued final permits
for the Kreider 1 System (including the credit verification plan) on August 1, 2012 on which date the Company deemed that the Kreider
1 System was ‘placed in service’. As a result, PA1 commenced generating nutrient reduction credits for potential sale
while continuing to utilize the Kreider 1 System to test improvements and add-ons. However, to date liquidity in the Pennsylvania
nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant breadth and depth, which limited liquidity/depth has negatively impacted
Bion’s business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reductions created by PA1’s existing
Kreider 1 project and Bion’s other proposed projects. These difficulties have prevented PA1 from generating any material
revenues from the Kreider 1 project to date and raise significant questions as to when, if ever, PA1 will be able to generate such
revenues from the Kreider 1 System. PA1 has had sporadic discussions/negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring
its obligations pursuant to the Pennvest Loan for more than three years. In the context of such discussions/negotiations, PA1 elected
not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the Company has not made any principal
payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore, the Company has classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability
as of December 31, 2019. Due to the failure of the Pennsylvania nutrient reduction credit market to develop, the Company determined
that the carrying amount of the property and equipment related to the Kreider 1 project exceeded its estimated future undiscounted
cash flows based on certain assumptions regarding timing, level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits
and, therefore, PA1 and the Company recorded impairments related to the value of the Kreider 1 assets of $1,750,000 and $2,000,000
at June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. During the 2016 fiscal year, PA1 and the Company recorded an impairment of $1,684,562
to the value of the Kreider 1 assets which reduced the value on the Company’s books to zero. This impairment reflects management’s
judgment that the salvage value of the Kreider 1 assets roughly equals PA1’s contractual obligations related to the Kreider
1 System, including expenses related to decommissioning of the Kreider 1 System, costs associated with needed capital upgrade
expenses, and re-certification/ permitting amendments. 
On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised
its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal,
interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make
the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest
rejected PA1’s proposal made during the fall of 2014. As of the date of this report, no formal proposals are currently under
consideration and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the last 5 years. It is not possible
at this date to predict the outcome of this matter, but the Company believes that a loan modification agreement (coupled with an
agreement regarding an update and re-start of full operations of KF1) may be reached in the future if/when a more robust market
for nutrient reductions develops in Pennsylvania, of which there is no assurance. PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various
options with regard to Kreider 1 over the next 180 days.
 
The economics (potential revenues, profitability
and continued operation) of the Kreider 1 System were based almost entirely on the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or
phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. See below for further discussion.
During August 2012, the Company provided
Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 System met the ‘technology guaranty’ standards
which were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan has been (and is now) solely an
obligation of PA1 since that date.
PA1 is currently maintaining the Kreider
1 System pending development of a more robust market for its nutrient reductions and/or its potential inclusion within the Kreider
2 Project discussed below.
 


29  
 

 
Bion continues its pre-development work
related to a waste treatment/renewable energy production facility to treat the waste from KF’s approximately 6+ million chickens
(planned to expand to approximately 9-10 million) (and potentially other poultry operations and/or other waste streams) ('Kreider
Renewable Energy Facility' or ‘ Kreider 2 Project’). On May 5, 2016, the Company executed a stand-alone joint venture
agreement with Kreider Farms covering all matters related to development and operation of Kreider 2 system to treat the waste streams
from Kreider’s poultry facilities in Bion PA2 LLC (“PA2”). During May 2011 the PADEP certified a smaller version
of the Kreider 2 Project for 559,457 nutrient credits under the old EPA’s Chesapeake Bay model. The Company has been in ongoing
discussions with the PADEP regarding the appropriate credit calculation methodology for large-scale technology-based nutrient reduction
installations such as the KF2 Project. Based on these discussions and the size of the Kreider 2 Project, we anticipate that when
designs are finalized, the Kreider 2 Project will be re-certified for a far larger number of credits (management’s current
estimates are between 2-4 million (or more) nutrient reduction credits for treatment of the waste stream from Kreider’s poultry
pursuant to the Company’s subsequent amended application during the current fiscal year pursuant to the amended EPA Chesapeake
Bay model and agreements between the EPA and PA. Note that this Project may be expanded in the future to treat wastes from other
local and regional CAFOs (poultry and/or dairy---including the Kreider Dairy) and/or additional Kreider poultry expansion (some
of which may not qualify for nutrient reduction credits). The review process to clarify certain issues related to credit calculation
and verification commenced during 2014 based on Bion’s 2G Tech but has been placed on hold while certain matters are resolved
between the EPA and Pennsylvania and pending development of a robust market for nutrient reductions in Pennsylvania. The Company
anticipates it will submit an amended or new application based on our 3G Technology once these matters are clear. Site specific
design and engineering work for this facility, which will probably be the first full-scale project to utilize Bion’s 3G Tech,
have not commenced, and the Company does not yet have financing in place for the Kreider 2 Project. This opportunity is being pursued
through PA2. If there are positive developments related to the market for nutrient reductions in Pennsylvania, of which there is
no assurance, the Company intends to pursue development, design and construction of the Kreider 2 Project with a goal of achieving
operational status for its initial modules during the coming calendar year, and hopes to enter into agreements related to sales
of the nutrient reduction credits for future delivery (under long term contracts) during the current 2020 fiscal year subject to
verification by the PADEP based on operating data from the Kreider 2 Project. The economics (potential revenues and profitability)
of the Kreider 2 Project, despite its use of Bion’s 3G Tech for increased recovery of marketable by-products, are based in
material part the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake
Bay environmental clean-up. However, liquidity in the Pennsylvania nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant
breadth and depth, which lack of liquidity has negatively impacted Bion’s business plans and has resulted in challenges to
monetizing the nutrient reduction credits generated by PA1’s existing Kreider 1 project and will most likely delay PA2’s
Kreider 2 Project and other proposed projects in Pennsylvania. 
 
Note that while Bion believes that the Kreider
1 System, the Kreider 2 Project and/or subsequent Bion Projects will eventually generate revenue from the sale of: a) nutrient
reductions (credits or in other form), b) renewable energy (and related credits), c) sales of fertilizer products, and/or d) potentially,
in time, credits for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, plus e) license fees related to a ‘sustainable brand’.
We believe that the potential market is very large, but it is not possible to predict the exact timing and/or magnitude of these
potential markets at this time.
 
A substantial portion of our activities involve
public policy initiatives (by the Company and other stakeholders) to encourage the establishment of appropriate public policies
and regulations (at federal, regional, state and local levels) to facilitate cost effective environmental clean-up and, thereby,
support our business activities. Bion has been joined by National Milk Producers Federation, Land O’Lakes, JBS and other
national livestock interests to support changes to our nation’s clean water strategy that will allow states to acquire low-cost
nutrient reductions through a competitive procurement process, in a similar manner to how government entities now acquire
many other goods and services on behalf of the taxpayer. As developing markets for nutrient reductions become fully-established,
Bion anticipates a robust business opportunity to retrofit existing CAFOs and develop Projects, based primarily on the sale of
nutrient credits that provide cost-effective alternatives to today’s high-cost and failing clean water strategy.
 
To date the market for long-term nutrient
reduction credits in Pennsylvania (‘PA’) has been very slow to develop and the Company’s activities have been
negatively affected by such lack of development. However, Bion is confident that once these markets are established, the credits
it produces will be competitive in the credit trading markets, based on its cost to remove nitrogen from the livestock waste stream,
compared to the cost to remove nitrogen through various other treatment activities.
 
 


30  
 

 
 
Several independent studies have calculated
the average cost to remove nitrogen through various sector practices. Reports prepared for the PA Senate (2008), Chesapeake Bay
Commission (2012) and PA legislature (2013; described below), as well as the Maryland Chesapeake Bay Financing Strategy Report
(2015), demonstrate that the cost to remove nitrogen (per pound on average) from agriculture is $44 to $54, municipal wastewater:
$28 to $43, and storm water: $386 to $633. Pursuant to the PA legislative Report, by replacing sector allocation (for all sectors)
with competitive bidding, up to 80 percent savings could be achieved in PA’s Chesapeake Bay compliance costs ($1.5 billion
annually) by 2025. If the legislative study had focused on the cost differentials of competitive bidding compared only with storm
water, the relative savings would be substantially greater.
 
Since these studies were completed, most of
the larger (Tier 1) municipal wastewater treatment plants in PA have been upgraded, at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion (vs
initial 2004 PA DEP cost estimates of $376 million). US EPA is now focused on PA’s storm water allocation (3.5 million pounds
(per last published data)) and has this sector on ‘backstop level actions’, the highest level of EPA-oversight and
the final step before sanctions. In the same 2004 PA DEP cost estimate that led to the more than a $2 billion underestimate/miscalculation
in municipal wastewater plant upgrade costs, the estimate for storm water cost was $5.6 billion. In April 2017, US EPA sent a Letter
of Expectation to PA DEP, expressing the agency’s support for the use of nutrient credit trading and competitive bidding
to engage the private-sector to lower costs. The letter specifically encouraged the use of credit trading to offset the state’s
looming storm water obligations.
 
The Company believes that: i) the April 2015
release of a report from the Pennsylvania Auditor General titled “Special Report on the Importance of Meeting Pennsylvania’s
Chesapeake Bay Nutrient Reduction Targets” which highlighted the economic consequences of EPA-imposed sanctions if the state
fails to meet the 2017 TMDL targets, as well as the need to support using low-cost solutions and technologies as alternatives to
higher-cost public infrastructure projects, where possible, and ii) Senate Bill 575 (introduced in April 2019 as successor to prior
SB 799 (which was passed by PA Senate during January 2018 but was not voted on in the House)) which, if adopted, will establish
a program that will allow the Pennsylvania’s tax- and rate-payers to meet significant portions of their EPA-mandated Chesapeake
Bay pollution reductions at significantly lower cost by purchasing verified reductions (by competitive bidding) from all sources,
including those that Bion can produce through livestock waste treatment, represent visible evidence of progress being made on these
matters in Pennsylvania. SB 575 was passed by the PA Senate in 2019 and introduced in the PA House which is scheduled to be taken
up the bill during its current session which is now underway. Such legislation (which has bi-partisan support), if passed and signed
into law (of which there is no assurance), will potentially enable Bion (and others) to compete for public funding on an equal
basis with subsidized agricultural ‘best management practices’ and public works and storm water authorities. Note,
however, that there is opposition to SB 575 (as was the case for SB 799 and its predecessors) from threatened stakeholders committed
to the existing status quo approaches--- a significant portion of which was focused on attacking (in often inaccurate and/or vilifying
ways) Bion in/through social media and internet articles, blogs, press releases, twitter posts and re-tweets, rather than engaging
the substantive issues. If legislation similar to SB 575 is passed (on a stand-alone basis or as part of a larger piece of legislation)
and implemented (in a form which maintains its core provisions), Bion expects that the policies and strategies being developed
in PA will not only benefit the Company’s existing and proposed PA projects, but will also subsequently provide the basis
for a larger Chesapeake Bay watershed strategy and, thereafter, a national clean water strategy.
 
The Company believes that Pennsylvania is ‘ground
zero’ in the long-standing clean water battle between agriculture and the further regulation of agriculture relative to nutrient
impacts. The ability of Bion and other technology providers to achieve verified reductions from agricultural non-point sources
can resolve the current stalemate and enable implementation of constructive solutions that benefit all stakeholders, providing
a mechanism that ensures that taxpayer funds will be used to achieve the most beneficial result at the lowest cost, regardless
of source. All sources, point and non-point, rural and urban, will be able to compete for tax payer-funded nitrogen reductions
in a fair and transparent process; and since payment from the tax and rate payers would now be performance-based, these providers
will be held financially accountable.
 


31  
 

 
 
We believe that the overwhelming environmental,
economic, quality of life and public health benefits to all stakeholders in the watershed, both within and outside of Pennsylvania,
make the case for adoption of the strategies outlined in the Report less an issue of ‘if’, but of ‘when and how’.
The adoption of a competitive procurement program will have significant positive impact on technology providers that can deliver
verified nitrogen reductions such as Bion, by allocating existing tax- and rate-payer clean water funding to low cost solutions
based upon a voluntary and transparent procurement process. The Company believes that implementation of a competitively-bid nutrient
reduction program to achieve the goals for the Chesapeake Bay watershed can also provide a working policy model and platform for
other states to adopt that will enhance their efforts to comply with both current and future requirements for local and federal
estuarine watersheds, including the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes Basin and other nutrient-impaired watersheds.
 
Bion will also pursue the opportunities
related to development of Projects (including Integrated Projects) which are likely to involve joint ventures with large livestock
producers who can utilize the benefits of the ‘sustainable branding’ that Bion technology can facilitate for products
produced utilizing its technology. Integrated Projects will include large CAFOs (such as large poultry facilities, dairy complexes,
beef cattle feed lots and/or hog farms) with Bion waste treatment/resource recovery system modules processing the aggregate CAFO
waste stream from the equivalent of 20,000 to 80,000 (or more) beef or dairy cows (or the waste stream equivalent of other species),
while recovering renewable energy and/or value-added fertilizer/soil amendment products, integrated to various degrees with CAFO
end product users/processing facilities, and/or potentially in some locations, a biofuel/ethanol plant. Such Integrated Projects
will involve large CAFOs with Bion waste treatment/resource recovery modules on a single site and/or on sites within an approximately
30-mile radius. Bion believes its 3G technology platform will allow integration of large-scale CAFO's with end product processors
(and/or potentially biofuel production), together with renewable energy production and co-product recovery from the waste streams,
and on-site energy utilization in a relatively 'closed loop' manner that will reduce the capital expenditures, operating costs
and carbon footprint for the entire Integrated Project and each component facility. Some Integrated Projects may be developed from
scratch while others may be developed in geographic proximity to (and in coordination with) existing participating CAFOs, feed
producers (corn growers and/or biofuel plants) and end product processors. Each Integrated Project is likely to have different
degrees of integration, especially in the early development phases.
 
The Company currently anticipates that the
Kreider 2 poultry waste treatment facility in PA will be its initial full-scale 3G Project. Bion anticipates that it will finalize
site selection for the Kreider 2 Project and/or its initial Integrated Project (and possibly additional Projects) during the current
fiscal year if SB 575 becomes law in PA. Bion hopes to commence development of its initial Project by optioning land and beginning
the site-specific design and permitting process during the current fiscal year, but further delays are possible. It is not possible
at this time to firmly predict where the initial Project will be developed or the order in which Projects will be developed. All
potential Projects are in very early discussion and pre-development stages and may never progress to actual development or may
be developed after other Projects not yet under active consideration.
 
Bion also hopes to be able to move forward
on additional Projects through 2020-2023 to create a pipeline of Projects. Management has a 5-year development target (through
calendar year 2025) of approximately 10 or more Projects pursuant to joint ventures (or similar agreements). Management hopes to
have identified and begun development work related to 3-5 Projects over the next 2 years. At the end of the 5-year period, Bion
projects that 3-8 of these Projects will be in full operation in 3-6 states (and possibly one or more foreign countries), and the
balance would be in various stages ranging from partial operation to early development stage. It is possible that one or more Projects
will be developed in joint ventures specifically targeted to meet the growing animal protein demand outside of the United States
(including without limitation Asia, Europe and/or the Middle East). No Projects (including Integrated Projects) have been developed
to date.

The Company’s audited financial statements
for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
incurred net losses of approximately $2,659,000 and $3,018,000 during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended June 30, 2019 includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph which means that there are factors
that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses
of approximately $1,207,000 and $1,442,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019,
the Company had a working capital deficit and a stockholders’ deficit of approximately $10,247,000 and $14,817,000, respectively.
Management’s plans with respect to these matters are described in this section and in our consolidated financial statements
(and notes thereto), and this material does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise sufficient funds or further capital for the operations planned in
the near future. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company currently does not generate
revenue and if and when the Company begins to generate revenue the Company will comply with the provisions of Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
Stock-based compensation
 
The Company follows the provisions of ASC
718, which generally requires that share-based compensation transactions be accounted and recognized in the statement of income
based upon their grant date fair values.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments:

 
Pursuant to ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives
and Hedging” (“Topic 815”), the Company reviews all financial instruments for the existence of features which
may require fair value accounting and a related mark-to-market adjustment at each reporting period end. Once determined, the Company
assesses these instruments as derivative liabilities. The fair value of these instruments is adjusted to reflect the fair value
at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment
to fair value of derivatives.
 
Warrants:
 
The Company has issued warrants to purchase
common shares of the Company. Warrants are valued using a fair value based method, whereby the fair value of the warrant is determined
at the warrant issue date using a market-based option valuation model based on factors including an evaluation of the Company’s
value as of the date of the issuance, consideration of the Company’s limited liquid resources and business prospects, the
market price of the Company’s stock in its mostly inactive public market and the historical valuations and purchases of the
Company’s warrants. When warrants are issued in combination with debt or equity securities, the warrants are valued and accounted
for based on the relative fair value of the warrants in relation to the total value assigned to the debt or equity securities and
warrants combined.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
 
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
“Compensation – Stock Compensation – Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting” to simplify
the accounting for share based payments granted to nonemployees and was adopted by the Company effective July 1, 2019. Under this
guidance, payments to nonemployees is aligned with the requirements for share based payments granted to employees. The adoption
of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements as previously issued share-based payments
to nonemployees had already reached a measurement date.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
The Company's consolidated financial statements
for the six months ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Report of our Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019 includes a "going
concern" explanatory paragraph which means that the auditors stated that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

 
Operating Activities
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had
cash of approximately $469,000. During the six months ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $477,000,
primarily consisting of cash operating expenses related to salaries and benefits, and other general and administrative costs such
as insurance, legal, accounting and investor relations expenses. As previously noted, the Company is currently not generating
significant revenue and accordingly has not generated cash flows from operations. The Company does not anticipate generating sufficient
revenues to offset operating and capital costs for a minimum of two to five years. While there are no assurances that the Company
will be successful in its efforts to develop and construct its Projects and market its Systems, it is certain that the Company
will require substantial funding from external sources. Given the unsettled state of the current credit and capital markets for
companies such as Bion, there is no assurance the Company will be able to raise the funds it needs on reasonable terms.
 
Financing Activities
 
During the six months ended December 31, 2019,
the Company received gross cash proceeds of $977,000 from the sale of 1,954,001 units which consists of one share of the Company’s
restricted common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of the Company’s restricted common stock for $0.75 per share
through December 2020. The Company paid cash commissions related to the sale of units of $87,000. The Company received proceeds
from loans from affiliates of $35,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and used $20,000 to repay such loans during
the same period.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has debt
obligations consisting of: a) deferred compensation of $537,000, b) convertible notes payable – affiliates of $4,523,000,
and, c) a loan payable and accrued interest of $9,445,000 (owed by PA1).
 


38  
 

 
 
Plan of Operations and Outlook
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash
of approximately $469,000.
 
The Company continues to explore sources
of additional financing to satisfy its current operating requirements as it is not currently generating any significant revenues.
During the past six years (fiscal years 2014 through 2019), the Company experienced greater difficulty in raising equity and debt
funding than in the prior years (which is not mitigated by the relative increase in equity funding during the year ended June 30,
2019). As a result, the Company faced, and continues to face, significant cash flow management challenges due to material working
capital constraints. These difficulties, challenges and constraints have continued during fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and the first
six (6) months of fiscal year 2020. The Company anticipates that they may continue for the next twelve (12) months or longer. To
partially mitigate these working capital constraints, the Company's core senior management and some key employees and consultants
have been deferring all or part of their cash compensation and/or are accepting compensation in the form of securities of the Company
(Notes 5 and 7 to Financial Statements) and members of the Company's senior management have made loans to the Company which have
been converted into convertible promissory notes as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended June 30, 2018 senior management
and certain core employees and consultants agreed to a one-time extinguishment of liabilities owed by the Company which in aggregate
totaled $2,404,000. As of December 31, 2019, such deferrals totaled approximately $5,060,000 (including accrued interest and deferred
compensation converted into promissory notes but excluding conversions of deferred compensation into the Company's common stock
by officers, employees and consultants that have already been completed). The extended constraints on available resources have
had, and continue to have, negative effects on the pace and scope of the Company's effort to develop its business. The Company
made reductions in its personnel during the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2015 and again in 2018. The Company has had to delay
payments of trade obligations and economize in many ways that have potentially negative consequences. If the Company does not have
greater success in its efforts to raise needed funds during the current year (and subsequent periods), we will need to consider
deeper cuts (including additional personnel cuts) and curtailments of operations (including possibly Kreider 1 operations). The
Company will need to obtain additional capital to fund its operations and technology development, to satisfy existing creditors,
to develop Projects (including Integrated Projects) and CAFO Retrofit waste remediation systems (including the Kreider 2 facility)
and to continue to operate the Kreider 1 facility (subject to agreements being reached with Pennvest as discussed above). The Company
anticipates that it will seek to raise from $2,500,000 to $50,000,000 or more (debt and equity) during the next twelve months.
However, as discussed above, there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise sufficient funds or further capital for the
operations planned in the near future.
 
The Company is not currently generating
any significant revenues. Further, the Company’s anticipated revenues, if any, from existing projects and proposed projects
will not be sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated operational and capital expenditure needs for many years. During
the six months ended December 31, 2019 the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately $977,000 through the sale of its securities
and paid commissions of approximately $87,000, and anticipates raising additional funds from such sales and transactions. However,
there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise sufficient funds or further capital for the operations planned in the near
future. 
 
Because the Company is not currently generating
significant revenues, the Company will need to obtain additional capital to fund its operations and technology development, to
satisfy existing creditors, to develop Projects and to sustain operations at the KF 1 facility.

The first commercial activity in the Retrofit
segment is represented by our agreement with Kreider Farms ("KF"), pursuant to which the Kreider 1 system to treat KF's
dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases to the environment while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy
was designed, constructed and entered full-scale operation during 2011. On January 26, 2009 the Board of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure
Investment Authority ("Pennvest") approved a $7.75 million loan to Bion PA 1, LLC ("PA1"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, for the initial Kreider Farms project ("Kreider 1 System"). After substantial unanticipated delays, on
August 12, 2010 PA1 received a permit for construction of the Kreider 1 system. Construction activities commenced during November
2010. The closing/settlement of the Pennvest Loan took place on November 3, 2010. PA1 finished the construction of the Kreider
1 System and entered a period of system 'operational shakedown' during May 2011. The Kreider 1 System reached full, stabilized
operation by the end of the 2012 fiscal year. During 2011 the PADEP re-certified the nutrient credits for this project. The PADEP
issued final permits for the Kreider 1 System (including the credit verification plan) on August 1, 2012 on which date the Company
deemed that the Kreider System was 'placed in service'. As a result, PA1 commenced generating nutrient reduction credits for potential
sale while continuing to utilize the Kreider 1 system to test improvements and add-ons. However, to date liquidity in the Pennsylvania
nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant breadth and depth, which limited liquidity/depth has negatively impacted
Bion's business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reductions created by PA1's existing Kreider 1
project and Bion's other proposed projects. These difficulties have prevented PA1 from generating any material revenues from the
Kreider 1 project to date and raise significant questions as to when, if ever, PA1 will be able to generate such revenues from
the Kreider 1 system. PA1 has had sporadic discussions/negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring
its obligations pursuant to the Pennvest Loan for more than three years. In the context of such discussions/negotiations, PA1 elected
not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the Company has not made any principal
payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore, the Company has classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability
as of December 31, 2019. Due to the failure of the PA nutrient reduction credit market to develop, the Company determined that
the carrying amount of the property and equipment related to the Kreider 1 project exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash
flows based on certain assumptions regarding timing, level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits
and, therefore, PA1 and the Company recorded impairments related to the value of the Kreider 1 assets of $1,750,000 and $2,000,000
at June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. During the 2016 fiscal year, PA1 and the Company recorded an impairment of $1,684,562
to the value of the Kreider 1 assets which reduced the value on the Company's books to zero. This impairment reflects management's
judgment that the salvage value of the Kreider 1 assets roughly equals PA1's contractual obligations related to the Kreider 1 system,
including expenses related to decommissioning of the Kreider 1 system, costs associated with needed capital upgrade expenses,
and re-certification/ permitting amendments. 
 
On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised
its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal,
interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make
the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest
rejected PA1's proposal made during the fall of 2014. As of the date of this report, no formal proposals are currently under consideration
and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the last 5 years. It is not possible at this
date to predict the outcome of this matter, but the Company believes that a loan modification agreement (coupled with an agreement
regarding an update and restart of full operations of KF1) may be reached in the future if/when a more robust market for nutrient
reductions develops in PA, of which there is no assurance. PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various options with regard to
Kreider 1 over the next 180 days.
 
The economics (potential revenues,
profitability and continued operation) of the Kreider 1 System are based almost entirely on the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen
and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. See below for further
discussion.
 
During August 2012, the Company provided
Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the 'technology guaranty' standards which were incorporated
in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan is now solely an obligation of PA1.
 
The Company is currently operating the
Kreider 1 System in a limited manner pending development of a more robust market for its nutrient reductions and/or its potential
inclusion within the Kreider 2 Project discussed above.
 
As indicated above, the Company anticipates
that it will seek to raise from $2,500,000 to $50,000,000 or more (from debt, equity, joint venture, strategic partnering, etc.)
during the next twelve months, some of which may be in the context of joint ventures for the development of one or more large scale
projects. We reiterate that there is no assurance, especially in the extremely unsettled capital markets that presently exist
for companies such as Bion, that the Company will be able to obtain the funds that it needs to stay in business, finance its Projects
and other activities, continue its technology development and/or to successfully develop its business.

There is extremely limited likelihood that
funds required during the next twelve months or in the periods immediately thereafter will be generated from operations and there
is no assurance that those funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources.
The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations and/or to raise capital from
external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse
effect on its business. Further, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive
terms or that they will not have a significantly dilutive effect on the Company's existing shareholders. All of these factors have
been exacerbated by the extremely limited and unsettled credit and capital markets presently existing for companies such as Bion.
Currently, Bion is focused on using applications
of its patented and proprietary waste management technologies and technology platform to pursue three main business opportunities:
1) installation of Bion systems ( some of which may generate verified nutrient reduction credits and revenues from the production
of renewable energy and byproducts) to retrofit and environmentally remediate existing CAFOs ("Retrofits") in selected
markets where: a) government policy supports such efforts (such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Great Lakes Basin states, and/or
other states and watersheds facing EPA 'total maximum daily load' ("TMDL") issues, and/or b) where CAFO's need our technology
to obtain permits to expand or develop without negative environmental consequences; 2) development of new state-of-the-art large
scale waste treatment facilities in joint ventures with large CAFO’s in strategic locations ("Projects") ( some
of these may be Integrated Projects as described below) with multiple revenue streams, and 3) licensing and/or joint venturing
of Bion's technology and applications (primarily) outside North America commencing during the 2020 calendar year. The opportunities
described at 1) and 2) above each require substantial political and regulatory (federal, state and local) efforts on the part of
the Company and a substantial part of Bion's efforts are focused on such political and regulatory matters. Bion is currently pursuing
the international opportunities primarily through the use of consultants with existing relationships in target countries. The most
intense focus is currently on the requirements for the clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay faced by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the potential use of Bion’s technology and technology platform on CAFOs to remediate ammonia release (and re-deposition
to the ground and water) and as an alternative to what the Company believes is far more expensive nutrient removal downstream in
storm water and other projects.
Additionally, the Kreider agreements provide
for Bion to develop a waste treatment/renewable energy production facility to treat the waste from Kreider's approximately 6+ million
chickens (planned to expand to approximately 9-10 million)(and potentially other poultry operations and/or other waste streams)('Kreider
Renewable Energy Facility' or ' Kreider 2 Project'). On May 5, 2016, the Company executed a stand-alone joint venture agreement
with Kreider Farms covering all matters related to development and operation of a system to treat the waste streams from Kreider's
poultry facilities in Bion PA2 LLC ("PA2"). The Company continues its development work related to the details of the
Kreider 2 Project. During May 2011 the PADEP certified Kreider 2 Project for 559,457 nutrient credits under the old EPA's Chesapeake
Bay model. The Company anticipates that the Kreider 2 Project will be re-certified for between 1.5-2 million (or more) nutrient
reduction credits (for treatment of the waste stream from Kreider's poultry) pursuant to the Company's pending reapplication (or
subsequent amended application) during 2018 pursuant to the amended EPA Chesapeake Bay model and agreements between the EPA and
PA. Note that this Project may be expanded in the future to treat wastes from other local and regional CAFOs (poultry and/or dairy
– including the Kreider Dairy) and/or Kreider poultry expansion (some of which may not qualify for nutrient reduction credits).
The review process to clarify certain issues related to credit calculation and verification commenced during 2014 based on Bion’s
2G Tech but has been largely placed on hold while certain matters are resolved between the EPA and PA and pending development of
a robust market for nutrient reductions in PA. The Company anticipates it will submit an amended application based on our 3G Technology
once these matters are clear. Site specific design and engineering work for this facility, which will probably be the first full-scale
project to utilize Bion's 3G Tech, have not commenced, and the Company does not yet have financing in place for the Kreider 2 Project.
This opportunity is being pursued through PA2. If there are positive developments related to the market for nutrient reductions
in PA, of which there is no assurance, the Company intends to pursue development, design and construction of the Kreider 2 Project
with a goal of achieving operational status of its initial modules during the 2020 calendar year, and hopes to enter into agreements
related to sales of the nutrient reduction credits for future delivery (under long term contracts) during the 2020 fiscal year
subject to verification by the PADEP based on operating data from the Kreider 2 Project. The economics (potential revenues and
profitability) of the Kreider 2 Project, despite its use of Bion's 3G Tech for increased recovery of marketable by-products, are
based in material part the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of
the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. However, liquidity in the PA nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant
breadth and depth, which lack of liquidity has negatively impacted Bion's business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing
the nutrient reduction credits generated by PA1's existing Kreider 1 project and will most likely delay PA2's Kreider 2 Project
and other proposed projects in PA.
 


41  
 

 
 
Note that while Bion believes that
the Kreider 1 System (when re-started), the Kreider 2 Project and/or subsequent Bion Projects will eventually generate revenue
from the sale of: a) nutrient reductions (credits or in other form), b) renewable energy (and related credits), c) sales of fertilizer
products, and/or d) potentially, in time, credits for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, plus e) license fees related to
a ‘sustainable brand’. We believe that the potential market is very large, but it is not possible to predict the exact
timing and/or magnitude of these potential markets at this time.
 
The Company anticipates that the Kreider
2 poultry waste treatment facility in PA will be its initial Project. Bion anticipates that it will select a site for the Kreider
2 Project and/or its initial Integrated Project (and possibly additional Projects) during the current fiscal year if SB575 becomes
law in PA. Bion hopes to commence development of its initial Project by optioning land and beginning the site specific design
and permitting process during the current year, but delays are possible. It is not possible at this time to firmly predict where
the initial Project will be developed or the order in which Projects will be developed. All potential Projects are in very early
pre-development stages and may never progress to actual development or may be developed after other Projects not yet under active
consideration.
 
Bion also hopes to be able to move forward
on additional Projects through 2020-23 to create a pipeline of Projects. Management has a 5-year development target (through calendar
year 2025) of approximately 10 or more Projects. Management hopes to have identified and begun development work related to 3-5
Projects over the next 2 years. At the end of the 5-year period, Bion projects that 3-8 of these Projects will be in full operation
in 3-6 states (and possibly one or more foreign countries), and the balance would be in various stages ranging from partial operation
to early development stage. It is possible that one or more Projects will be developed in joint ventures specifically targeted
to meet the growing animal protein demand outside of the United States (including without limitation Asia, Europe and/or the Middle
East). No Projects (including Integrated Projects) has been developed to date.
 
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
 
We have the following material contractual
obligations (in addition to employment and consulting agreements with management and employees):
 
During 2008 the Company commenced actively
pursuing the opportunity presented by environmental retrofit and remediation of the waste streams of existing CAFOs which effort
has met with very limited success to date. The first commercial activity in this area is represented by our agreement with Kreider
Farms ("KF"), pursuant to which the Kreider 1 system to treat KF's dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases to
the environment while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy was designed, constructed and entered full-scale
operation during 2011. On January 26, 2009 the Board of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority ("Pennvest")
approved a $7.75 million loan to Bion PA 1, LLC ("PA1"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the initial Kreider
Farms project ("Kreider 1 System"). After substantial unanticipated delays, on August 12, 2010 PA1 received a permit
for construction of the Kreider 1 system. Construction activities commenced during November 2010. The closing/settlement of the
Pennvest Loan took place on November 3, 2010. PA1 finished the construction of the Kreider 1 System and entered a period of system
'operational shakedown' during May 2011. The Kreider 1System reached full, stabilized operation by the end of the 2012 fiscal year.
During 2011 the PADEP re-certified the nutrient credits for this project. The PADEP issued final permits for the Kreider 1 System
(including the credit verification plan) on August 1, 2012 on which date the Company deemed that the Kreider System was 'placed
in service'. As a result, PA1 commenced generating nutrient reduction credits for potential sale while continuing to utilize the
Kreider 1 system to test improvements and add-ons. However, to date liquidity in the Pennsylvania nutrient credit market has
been slow to develop significant breadth and depth, which limited liquidity/depth has negatively impacted Bion's business plans
and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reductions created by PA1's existing Kreider 1 project and Bion's other
proposed projects. These difficulties have prevented PA1 from generating any material revenues from the Kreider 1 project to date
and raise significant questions as to when, if ever, PA1 will be able to generate such revenues from the Kreider 1 system. PA1
has had sporadic discussions/negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring its obligations pursuant to
the Pennvest Loan for more than three years. In the context of such discussions/negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest
payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the Company has not made any principal payments, which
were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore, the Company has classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability as of December
31, 2019. Due to the failure of the PA nutrient reduction credit market to develop, the Company determined that the carrying amount
of the property and equipment related to the Kreider 1 project exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows based on certain
assumptions regarding timing, level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits and, therefore, PA1 and
the Company recorded impairments related to the value of the Kreider 1 assets of $1,750,000 and $2,000,000 at June 30, 2015 and
June 30, 2014, respectively. During the 2016 fiscal year, PA1 and the Company recorded an impairment of $1,684,562 to the value
of the Kreider 1 assets which reduced the value on the Company's books to zero. This impairment reflects management's judgment
that the salvage value of the Kreider 1 assets roughly equals PA1's contractual obligations related to the Kreider 1 system, including
expenses related to decommissioning of the Kreider 1 system, costs associated with needed capital upgrade expenses, and
re-certification/ permitting amendments.

On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised
its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal,
interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make
the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest
rejected PA1's proposal made during the fall of 2014. As of the date of this report, no formal proposals are currently under consideration
and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the 5 years. It is not possible at this date
to predict the outcome of this matter, but the Company believes that a loan modification agreement (coupled with an agreement regarding
an update and restart of full operations of KF1) may be reached in the future if/when a more robust market for nutrient reductions
develops in PA, of which there is no assurance. PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various options with regard to Kreider 1
over the next 180 days.
 
The economics (potential revenues, profitability
and continued operation) of the Kreider 1 System are based almost entirely on the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus)
reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. 
 
During August 2012, the Company provided Pennvest
(and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the 'technology guaranty' standards which were incorporated
in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan is now solely an obligation of PA1.
 
The Company is currently operating the Kreider
1 System in a limited manner pending development of a more robust market for its nutrient reductions and/or its potential inclusion
within the Kreider 2 Project discussed below.
 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
(as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect
on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.
Not applicable.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.
The term "disclosure controls and
procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"). This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the required time periods. Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report,
and has concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at ensuring that required information
will be disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, as a result of the material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting discussed in Item 9(A) of our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019.
(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.
No change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the period covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.
On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised
its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and has accelerated the Pennvest Loan and has demanded that our wholly-owned
subsidiary Bion PA-1 LLC (‘PA-1’) pay $8,137,117 (principal, interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014.
The Company anticipates that it is possible that discussions and negotiations will take place between PA-1 and Pennvest concerning
this matter over the next 90-180 days if legislation is passed in Pennsylvania. No proposals are currently under consideration
to resolve this matter. It is not possible at this date to predict the outcome of such negotiations, but the Company believes that
it remains possible that negotiations will lead to a commercially reasonable loan modification agreement be reached between PA-1
and Pennvest. Subject to the results of the negotiations with Pennvest and pending development of a more robust market for nutrient
reductions in Pennsylvania, PA-1 and Bion anticipate that it will be necessary for the Company to evaluate various options with
regard to Kreider 1 over the coming months. Litigation has not commenced in this matter but has been threatened by Pennvest.
The Company currently is not involved in any other material
litigation.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors.
Not applicable.
Item 2.  Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
