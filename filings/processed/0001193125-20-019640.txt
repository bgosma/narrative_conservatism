NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited)  (Dollars in thousands,
except where noted and per share data)  Note 1  Basis of Presentation and Description of Business 
As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms we, us, our or Company collectively refer to
John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, JBSS Ventures, LLC. Our fiscal year ends on the final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of fifty-two weeks (four
thirteen-week quarters). Additional information on the comparability of the periods presented is as follows:   
  
  

We are one of the leading processors and distributors of peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds, and other nuts in the United States. These nuts are sold
under a variety of private brands and under the Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand, Southern Style Nuts and Sunshine Country brand names. We also market and distribute, and in most cases, manufacture or process, a
diverse product line of food and snack products, including peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, candy and confections, snacks and trail mixes, snack bites, sunflower kernels, dried fruit, corn snacks, chickpea snacks, sesame sticks and other
sesame snack products under private brands and brand names. Our products are sold through three primary distribution channels to significant buyers of nuts, including food retailers in the consumer channel, commercial ingredient users and contract
packaging customers.  The accompanying unaudited financial statements fairly present the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated
balance sheets, consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows, and reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which are necessary for the fair statement of the results of
the interim periods. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. The balance sheet data as of June 27,
2019 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Accordingly, these unaudited financial statements and
related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2019.
 Note 2  Revenue Recognition  We recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For each customer contract, a five-step process is
followed in which we identify the contract, identify performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognize the revenue when (or as) the performance obligation
is transferred to the customer.  When Performance Obligations Are Satisfied 
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition.
A contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Companys performance obligations are primarily for the delivery of raw
and processed recipe and snack nuts, nut butters and trail mixes. 
  8 



Table of Contents

Our customer contracts do not include more than one performance obligation. If a contract were to contain
more than one performance obligation, we are required to allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for each distinct good is generally
determined by directly observable data.  Revenue recognition is generally completed at a point in time when product control is transferred to the
customer. For approximately 99% of our revenues, control transfers to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer based upon applicable shipping terms, as the customer can then direct the use and obtain substantially all of
the remaining benefits from the asset at that point in time. Therefore, for 99% of our revenues, the timing of revenue recognition requires little judgment. 
Variable Consideration  Some of our products are sold
through specific incentive programs consisting of promotional allowances, volume and customer rebates, in-store display incentives and marketing allowances, among others, to consumer and some commercial
ingredient customers. The ultimate cost of these programs is dependent on certain factors such as actual purchase volumes or customer activities and is dependent on significant management estimate and judgment. The Company accounts for these
programs as variable consideration and recognizes a reduction in revenue (and a corresponding reduction in the transaction price) in the same period as the underlying program based upon the terms of the specific arrangements. 
Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are also offered through various programs to
customers and consumers. A provision for estimated trade promotions is recorded as a reduction of revenue (and a reduction in the transaction price) in the same period when the sale is recognized. Revenues are also recorded net of expected customer
deductions which are provided for based upon past experiences. Evaluating these estimates requires management judgment.  We generally use the most likely
amount method to determine the variable consideration. We believe there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any related uncertainties are resolved with our customers. The Company reviews and updates its
estimates and related accruals of variable consideration and trade promotions at least quarterly based on the terms of the agreements and historical experience. Any uncertainties in the ultimate resolution of variable consideration due to factors
outside of the Companys influence are typically resolved within a short timeframe, therefore, no additional constraint on the variable consideration is required. 
Contract Balances  Contract assets or liabilities result
from transactions with revenue recorded over time. If the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations the Company records a contract asset. Conversely, if the measure of the remaining performance
obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights, the Company records a contract liability. There was no contract asset balance at December 26, 2019. Contract asset balances at June 27, 2019 and December 27, 2018 were $117 and
$65, respectively, and are recorded in the caption Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company generally does not have material deferred revenue or contract liability balances arising from
transactions with customers.  Disaggregation of Revenue 
Revenue disaggregated by sales channel is as follows:

Note 3  Leases 
On June 28, 2019 we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) using the alternative
transition method under ASU No. 2018-11, which permitted application of the new guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption, with comparative periods continuing to be reported under the previous
lease accounting guidance in Topic 840. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease
classification. We did not elect the practical expedients regarding hindsight or land easements. See Note 15  Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional information. 
Upon adoption of the new standard, we recognized operating lease right-of-use
assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $5,361 and $5,320 respectively. We utilized a portfolio approach to establish discount rates for leases that are similar. Discount rates ranging from 4.2% to 5.8% were used when determining
the present value of future lease payments. All of our lessee arrangements that were classified as operating leases under Topic 840 continue to be classified as operating leases since the adoption of Topic 842, and the pattern of lease expense
recognition is unchanged. The adoption of Topic 842 did not materially impact our consolidated net earnings and had no impact on cash flows. 
Description of Leases  We lease equipment used in the
transportation of goods in our warehouses, as well as a limited number of automobiles and a small warehouse near our Bainbridge, Georgia facility. Our leases generally do not contain non-lease components and
do not contain any explicit guarantees of residual value. Our leases for warehouse transportation equipment generally require the equipment to be returned to the lessor in good working order. 
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and analyze the lease to determine if it is operating or finance. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental collateralized borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Implicit rates are used
when readily determinable. None of our leases currently contain options to extend the term. In the event of an option to extend the term of a lease, the lease term used in measuring the liability would include options to extend or terminate the
lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. Our leases have remaining terms of up to 5.4 years. 
Topic 842 allows for the election as an accounting policy to not apply lease recognition requirements to short term leases, defined as leases with an initial
term of 12 months or less. We have elected to use this policy, and as such, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have also made the policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases.  The following table provides supplemental information related to operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities:

Table of Contents

The following tables summarize the Companys total lease costs and other information arising from
operating lease transactions:   
  


(a) 
 Includes short-term leases which are immaterial. 


(b) 
 Variable lease costs consist of sales tax. 
Supplemental cash flow and other information related to leases was as follows:   
 Maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 26, 2019 are as follows: 
 
 As of December 26, 2019 the Company has additional operating leases totaling $164 that have not yet commenced and
therefore are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and tables above. These leases will commence in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with initial lease terms ranging from 3 to 5 years. 
Disclosures related to periods prior to adoption  As the
Company has not recast prior year information for its adoption of Topic 842, the following presents its future minimum lease payments for operating leases under Topic 840 on June 27, 2019:

Lessor Accounting 
We lease office space in our four-story office building located in Elgin, Illinois. As a lessor, we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of
ownership of the investment property and under Topic 842 we continue to account for all of our leases as operating leases. Lease agreements may include options to renew. We accrue fixed lease income on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. There is generally an immaterial amount of variable lease consideration and an immaterial amount of non-lease
components such as recurring utility and storage fees. Leases between related parties are immaterial.  Leasing revenue is as follows: 
 
 The future minimum, undiscounted cash flows under non-cancelable tenant operating
leases for each of the next five years and thereafter is presented below and is materially consistent with our previous accounting under Topic 840.   
 Note 4  Inventories 
Inventories consist of the following:   
 Note 5  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of the following: 
 

  12 



Table of Contents

Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis. The brand names remaining to be
amortized consist of the Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts brand names.  Total amortization expense related to intangible assets, which
is a component of Administrative expense, was $672 and $1,344 for the quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December 26, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for the remainder of fiscal 2020 is expected
to be approximately $1,157 and expected amortization expense the next five fiscal years is as follows:   
 Our net goodwill of $9,650 relates entirely to the Squirrel Brand acquisition (the Acquisition) completed in the
second quarter of fiscal 2018. There was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill during the twenty-six weeks ended December 26, 2019. 
Note 6  Credit Facility  On February 7, 2008,
we entered into a Credit Agreement with a bank group providing a $117,500 revolving loan commitment and letter of credit subfacility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all our assets other than real
property and fixtures.  At December 26, 2019, we had $100,830 of available credit under the Credit Facility which reflects borrowings of $13,495 and
reduced availability as a result of $3,175 in outstanding letters of credit. As of December 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility and Mortgage Facility. 
Note 7  Earnings Per Common Share  The following
table presents the reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share:   
 There were no anti-dilutive awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for any periods presented. 
Note 8  Stock-Based Compensation Plans  During the
second quarter of fiscal 2020, there were 38,572 restricted stock units (RSUs) awarded to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The vesting period is generally three years
for awards to employees and one year for awards to non-employee directors.  There was no stock option activity
during the first half of fiscal 2020. 
  13 



Table of Contents

The following is a summary of RSU activity for the first half of fiscal 2020: 
 
  


(a) 
 The number of RSUs vested includes shares that were withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy statutory tax
withholding requirements.  At December 26, 2019, there were 58,541 RSUs outstanding that were vested but deferred. 
The following table summarizes compensation expense charged to earnings for all equity compensation plans for the periods presented: 
 
 As of December 26, 2019, there was $5,255 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs granted under our stock-based compensation plans. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. 
Note 9  Retirement Plan  The Supplemental Employee
Retirement Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that will provide eligible participants with monthly benefits upon retirement, disability or death, subject to certain conditions. The
monthly benefit is based upon each participants earnings and his or her number of years of service. The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows:   
 The components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item Other
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Note 10  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
The table below sets forth the changes to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) for the twenty-six
weeks ended December 26, 2019 and December 27, 2018. These changes are all related to our defined benefit pension plan. 
 
  


(a)
 Amounts in parenthesis indicate debits/expense. 


(b)
 See Note 15  Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.
 The reclassifications out of AOCL for the quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December 26,
2019 and December 27, 2018 were as follows:   
  


(c) 
 Amounts in parenthesis indicate debits to expense. See Note 9  Retirement Plan above for
additional details.  Note 11  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
We are currently a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcomes of
these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially affect our Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could
occur. Unfavorable outcomes could include substantial monetary damages in excess of any accruals that management has established. Were such unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Note 12  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) defines fair value as the price that would be received for an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into
three broad levels:   








Level 1
  

  
Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.





Level 2
  

  
Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.





Level 3
  

  
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available.
 The carrying values of cash, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values at each balance
sheet date because of the short-term maturities and nature of these balances.  The carrying value of our revolving credit facility borrowings approximates
fair value at each balance sheet date because interest rates on this instrument approximate current market rates (Level 2 criteria), the short-term maturity and nature of this balance. In addition, there has been no significant change in our
inherent credit risk.  The following table summarizes the carrying value and fair value estimate of our current and long-term debt, excluding unamortized
debt issuance costs:   
 The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined using a market approach based upon Level 2 observable
inputs, which estimates fair value based on interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality or broker quotes. In addition, there have been no significant changes in the underlying assets securing
our long-term debt.  Note 13  Related Party Transaction 
In connection with the Acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we incurred $11,500 of unsecured debt (the Promissory Note) to the
principal owner and seller of the Squirrel Brand business, who was subsequently appointed as an executive officer of the Company and was considered a related party. Late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the employment of this executive officer
with the Company ceased. He is no longer considered a related party, and therefore the outstanding balance on the Promissory Note is not reflected as related party debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 26, 2019. Interest paid on
the Promissory Note for the quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December 26, 2019 while the executive officer was still a related party was $57 and $127, respectively, and is reflected as related party
interest on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Note 14  Garysburg, North Carolina Facility 
On October 7, 2019 we experienced a fire at our peanut processing facility located in Garysburg, North Carolina. No personnel were injured, and there was
no damage to our peanut shelling and inventory storage areas. The fire occurred in our roasting room where all of the roasting equipment was destroyed. The fire also damaged some equipment in our packaging room and a portion of the roof. We have
contracted with a third party to roast and salt our inshell peanuts to meet our current production requirements. We do not expect any negative impact on our customer service levels or a material adverse impact on our operating or financial results
for the 2020 fiscal year.  After evaluating our options with regard to our peanut production operations, the Company is considering strategic alternatives
for this facility and currently plans to permanently cease all operations at the Garysburg facility once we have finished shelling the current crop of peanuts at this facility, which is estimated to take approximately sixteen months. We have ceased
roasting operations in the current second quarter, which resulted in a partial reduction in the workforce at this facility, and recognized an immaterial amount of separation costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. 
We have adequate property damage and business interruption insurance, subject to applicable deductibles. To date, approximately $1,500 in clean-up costs and damage to capital assets has been incurred. Insurance claims have been filed under our property damage and business interruption policies, and an advance payment of $1,500 was received from the
insurance carrier in our current second quarter. Insurance proceeds received for damage to capital equipment were recorded as investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Note 15  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The
following recent accounting pronouncements have been adopted in the current fiscal year:  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). The primary goal of this Update is to require the lessee to recognize all lease commitments, both operating and finance, by initially recording a lease asset
and liability on the balance sheet at the lease commencement date. Additionally, enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for public business entities
for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. This new guidance became effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020. Under ASU
No. 2016-02 the guidance was to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with elective reliefs, with application of the new guidance for all periods presented. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2018-11 Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements which provides for another transition method by allowing entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date
and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The amendments in this Update also provide lessors with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component, similar to the expedient provided for lessees. In July 2018, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2018-10
Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases which affects narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU No. 2016-02. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20 Leases (Topic 842)  Narrow Scope Improvements for Lessors which provides specific guidance for lessors on the issues of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from
lessees, certain lessor costs, and recognition of variable payments for contracts with lease and non-lease components. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2019-01 Leases (Topic 842)  Codification Improvements which clarifies transition disclosure requirements for annual and interim periods after the date of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02.  We have implemented processes and information technology tools to assist in our compliance with Topic
842. We have also updated our accounting policies and internal controls that are impacted by the new guidance. We adopted ASU No. 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and did not
recast comparative periods in transition to the new standard. In addition, the new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to
reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or
the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease
right-of-use assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $5,361 and $5,320, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The new standard also
provides practical expedients for an entitys initial and ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. Refer to Note 3  Leases for additional information regarding the Companys leases.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
Income Statement  Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this Update allow a reclassification from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCL) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The amendments in this Update also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The amendments
in this Update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The Company
adopted ASU No. 2018-02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and reclassified $976 from AOCL to retained earnings. Refer to Note 10  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for additional
detail. ASU 2018-02 was not applied retrospectively. No other income tax effects related to the application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act were reclassified from AOCL to retained earnings. 
The following recent accounting pronouncements have not yet been adopted: 
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in
this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions, providing updated requirements and specifications in certain areas and by making minor codification improvements. The amendments in this Update are effective for
public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. This Update is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2022. We do not expect
this accounting Update to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

fifty-two weeks (four thirteen-week quarters). Additional information on the comparability of the periods presented is as follows:   
  
  

As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms we, us, our or Company collectively refer to
John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, JBSS Ventures, LLC. Our Companys Credit Facility and Mortgage Facility, as defined below, are sometimes collectively referred to as our financing
arrangements.  We are one of the leading processors and distributors of peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds and other nuts in the United
States. These nuts are sold under a variety of private brands and under the Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand, Southern Style Nuts and Sunshine Country brand names. We also market and distribute, and in most cases,
manufacture or process, a diverse product line of food and snack products, including peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, candy and confections, snacks and trail mixes, snack bites, sunflower kernels, dried fruit, corn snacks, chickpea
snacks, sesame sticks and other sesame snack products under private brands and brand names. We distribute our products in the consumer, commercial ingredients and contract packaging distribution channels. 
The Companys long-term objective to drive profitable growth, as identified in our strategic plan (the Strategic Plan), includes continuing
to grow Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts into leading nut brands by focusing on consumers demanding quality nuts in the snacking, recipe, trail and snack mix and produce
categories, providing integrated nut solutions to grow non-branded business at existing key customers in each distribution channel and expanding our offerings into alternative distribution channels. We are
executing on our Strategic Plan by continuing to expand distribution of our Orchard Valley Harvest and Southern Style Nuts products, growing our consumer distribution channel with private brand products and expanding distribution with
new foodservice customers.  We face a number of challenges in the future which include, among others, potential acquisition cost volatility for almonds
and increasing commodity costs for walnuts, as well as intensified competition on pricing and for market share from both private brand and name brand nut products. Our Fisher recipe nut sales have been negatively impacted recently due to this
increased competition for market share. We also face changing industry trends resulting in retail consolidation and Internet price competition for nut and nut-related products. 
We will continue to focus on seeking profitable business opportunities to maximize the utilization of our production capacity at our primary manufacturing,
processing and distribution facility located in Elgin, Illinois (the Elgin Site) and evaluate facility expansion to meet customer demand. We expect to maintain our current level of promotional and advertising activity for our Orchard
Valley Harvest and Fisher snack brands. We continue to see significant domestic sales and volume growth in our Orchard Valley Harvest brand and will continue to focus on this portion of our branded business as well as our
Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts brands. We will continue to face the ongoing challenges specific to our business, such as food safety and regulatory issues and the maintenance and growth of our customer base for branded and
private label products. See the information referenced in Part II, Item 1A  Risk Factors of this report for additional information about our risks, challenges and uncertainties.

acquisition costs for pecans. We completed procurement of inshell walnuts during the first half of fiscal 2020. During the third quarter, we will determine the final prices to be paid to the walnut growers based upon current market prices and other
factors such as crop size and export demand. We have estimated the liability to our walnut growers and our walnut inventory costs using currently available information. Any difference between our estimated liability and the actual final liability
will be determined during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and will be recognized in our financial results at that time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
Net Sales  Our net sales decreased 2.7% to
$246.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to net sales of $253.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower selling prices, which resulted from a shift in
sales volume from higher priced pecans and walnuts to lower priced trail and snack mixes, peanuts and cashews. Lower selling prices for pecans and cashews, which were due to lower commodity acquisition costs, also contributed to the overall
reduction in selling prices. The decline in net sales from lower selling prices was largely offset by a 4.8% increase in sales volume, which is defined as pounds sold to customers. 
For the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 our net sales were $464.3 million, an increase of
$6.7 million, or 1.5%, compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. The increase in net sales was due to a 6.8% increase in sales volume and was largely offset by lower selling prices resulting primarily for the same reasons cited in the
quarterly comparison.  The following table summarizes sales by product type as a percentage of total gross sales. The information is based upon gross
sales, rather than net sales, because certain adjustments, such as promotional discounts, are not allocable to product type.   
 The following table shows a comparison of net sales by distribution channel (dollars in thousands):

The following table shows a comparison of net sales by distribution channel (dollars in thousands): 
 
  

Net sales in the consumer distribution channel decreased $7.4 million, or 3.8%, and sales volume increased 4.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020
compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The sales volume increase was driven by increased sales of private brand snack nuts and trail and snack mixes from distribution gains with new and existing private brand customers. Sales volume for
Fisher snack nuts decreased 6.4%, primarily as a result of reduced promotional activity for inshell peanuts. Sales volume of Fisher recipe nuts decreased 29.8% from lost holiday display distribution at a major customer in favor of
their private brand recipe nuts. Sales volume of Orchard Valley Harvest products increased 6.5% due to distribution gains at new and existing customers and the introduction of new products. Sales volume of Southern Style Nuts
increased 42.9% due to increased promotional activity.  In the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020, net sales in
the consumer distribution channel increased $10.3 million, or 3.1%, and sales volume increased 10.0% compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. The sales volume increase occurred for the same reason cited in the quarterly comparison. Increased
sales for our Orchard Valley Harvest and Southern Style Nut brands also contributed to the sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel. Sales volume for Fisher recipe nuts decreased 30.0% in the year to date
comparison as a result of lost distribution at a major customer in favor of their private brand recipe nuts.  Net sales in the commercial ingredients
distribution channel increased by 8.9% in dollars and 14.5% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020, net
sales in the commercial ingredients distribution channel increased by 3.6% in dollars and 6.3% in sales volume compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. The sales volume increase, for both the quarterly and
twenty-six week period, was primarily due to distribution gains with new food service customers and increased sales of peanut crushing stock to peanut oil processors. 
Net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by 8.7% in dollars and 2.5% in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared
to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decline in sales volume primarily came from a reduction in promotional and merchandising activity by some customers in this channel. In the first twenty-six weeks of
fiscal 2020, net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by 11.3% in dollars and 7.9% in sales volume compared to the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. The decline in sales volume
occurred for the same reason cited in the quarterly comparison, as well as from a reduction in unit ounce weights implemented by a major contract packaging customer. 
Gross Profit  Gross profit increased by
$7.1 million, or 16.5%, to $50.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 20.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020
compared to 16.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly attributable to the sales volume increase discussed above, as well as manufacturing efficiencies, reduced manufacturing
spending and lower commodity acquisition costs for pecans and cashews.

Table of Contents

Gross profit increased by $16.4 million, or 21.6%, to $92.2 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. Our gross profit margin increased to 19.9% for the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to 16.6% for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. The increases in gross profit and gross profit margin in the year to
date comparison occurred primarily for the same reasons cited in the quarterly comparison.  Operating Expenses 
Total operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by $0.7 million, or 2.8%, to $25.5 million. As a percentage of net sales,
operating expenses remain unchanged at 10.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  Selling expenses for
the second quarter of fiscal 2020 were $16.1 million, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 11.5%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by a $2.5 million decrease in advertising expense primarily related
to TV and magazine advertising and a $0.9 million decrease in freight expense. Partially offsetting these decreases were a $0.7 million increase in payroll related and incentive compensation expense and a $0.4 million increase in
commission expense.  Administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 were $9.4 million compared to $8.1 million for the second
quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in compensation related expenses, primarily incentive compensation, a $0.2 million increase in building repairs and maintenance expense. 
Total operating expenses for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 decreased by $0.4 million, or 0.9%, to
$48.7 million. Operating expenses decreased to 10.5% of net sales for the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to 10.7% of net sales for the first half of fiscal 2019. 
Selling expenses for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 were $30.2 million, a decrease of
$2.0 million, or 6.3%, from the amount recorded for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by a $2.9 million decrease in advertising expense and a
$1.3 million decrease in freight expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in payroll related and incentive compensation expense and a $0.5 million increase in commission expense. 
Administrative expenses for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 were $18.5 million, an increase of
$1.6 million, or 9.5%, compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to $1.5 million increase in compensation related expenses, primarily incentive compensation, and a $0.3 million increase in building
repairs and maintenance expense.  Income from Operations 
Due to the factors discussed above, income from operations was $24.5 million, or 9.9% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to
$16.6 million, or 6.6% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  Due to the factors discussed above, income from operations was
$43.5 million, or 9.4% of net sales, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to $26.7 million, or 5.8% of net sales, for the first twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2019.  Interest Expense 
Interest expense was $0.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $0.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Interest
expense for the first two quarters of fiscal 2020 was $1.0 million compared to $1.7 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average debt levels.

Rental and Miscellaneous Expense, Net 
Net rental and miscellaneous expense was $0.3 million for the second quarter of both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Net rental and miscellaneous expense was
$0.7 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to $0.6 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. 
Other Expense  Other expense consists of pension
related expenses other than the service cost component and was $0.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $0.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Other expense was $1.1 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to $1.0 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. 
Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense was
$5.7 million, or 24.7% of income before income taxes (the Effective Tax Rate), for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $3.8 million, or 25.3% of income before income taxes, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. For
the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020, income tax expense was $10.4 million, or 25.5% of income before income taxes, compared to $5.6 million, or 23.9% of income before income taxes, for the
comparable period last year. The Effective Tax Rate in the comparative twenty-six week period was reduced due to a change in the rate that our deferred tax assets are measured due to the impact of Tax Reform.
This change increased our net deferred tax assets and reduced income tax expense in the comparative twenty-six week period.  Net Income 
Net income was $17.5 million, or $1.52 per common share basic and diluted, for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to $11.3 million, or $0.99
per common share basic and $0.98 per common share diluted, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  Net income was $30.4 million, or $2.65 per common
share basic and $2.64 per share diluted, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020, compared to net income of $17.9 million, or $1.57 per common share basic and $1.56 per share diluted, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
General  The primary uses of cash are to fund our
current operations, fulfill contractual obligations, pursue our Strategic Plan through growing our branded and private label nut programs and repay indebtedness. Also, various uncertainties could result in additional uses of cash. The primary
sources of cash are results of operations and availability under our Credit Agreement, dated February 7, 2008 and subsequently amended most recently in November 2017 (as amended, the Credit Facility), that provides a revolving loan
commitment and letter of credit subfacility. We anticipate that expected net cash flow generated from operations and amounts available pursuant to the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Our
available credit under our Credit Facility has historically allowed us to promote our products and invest in our brands (especially our Fisher and Orchard Valley Harvest brands), consummate strategic business acquisitions such as the
2018 acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business, reinvest in the Company through capital expenditures, develop new products, pay cash dividends the past seven years and explore other growth strategies outlined in our Strategic Plan. 
Cash flows from operating activities have historically been driven by net income but are also significantly influenced by inventory requirements, which can
change based upon fluctuations in both quantities and market prices of the various nuts and nut products we buy and sell. Current market trends in nut prices and crop estimates also impact nut procurement. 
The following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the first half of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively (dollars in thousands): 
 

  24 



Table of Contents

Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $54.3 million for the
first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to $48.4 million for the comparative period of fiscal 2019. The increase in operating cash flow was due primarily to a $12.5 million increase in net
income driven by increased sales and improved profitability, which was partially offset due to an increased use of working capital for inventory compared to the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2019. 
Total inventories were $172.3 million at December 26, 2019, an increase of $15.3 million, or 9.8%, from the inventory balance at June 27,
2019, and an increase of $0.6 million, or 0.4%, from the inventory balance at December 27, 2018. The increase in inventory at December 26, 2019 compared to June 27, 2019 was primarily due to greater quantities of walnuts on hand
at a higher acquisition cost, which was partially offset by lower acquisition costs for pecans.  Raw nut and dried fruit input stocks, some of which are
classified as work in process, decreased by 9.8 million pounds, or 11.8%, at December 26, 2019 compared to December 27, 2018 due to lower quantities of peanuts and pecans on hand. The weighted average cost per pound of raw nut input
stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 7.1% compared to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to a higher acquisition cost for walnuts, which was offset in part by lower acquisition costs for
pecans, cashews and peanuts.  Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $6.1 million during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to $9.3 million for the same period last year. We expect total capital expenditures for new equipment, facility upgrades, and food safety enhancements for fiscal
2020 to be approximately $17 to $20 million. Absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments, we believe that cash on hand, combined with cash provided by operations and borrowings available under the Credit Facility,
will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements for planned capital expenditures.  Financing Activities Cash used in financing
activities was $48.3 million during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2020 compared to $37.9 million for the same period last year. We paid $57.3 million of dividends in the first half of
fiscal 2020 compared to $29.1 million during the same period last year. Net borrowings under our Credit Facility were $13.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to net repayments of $6.7 million for the first half of
fiscal 2019. The increase in short term borrowings under our Credit Facility was due to higher dividends paid in fiscal 2020 and was partially offset by an increased operating cash flows. 
Real Estate Matters  In August 2008, we completed
the consolidation of our Chicago-based facilities into the Elgin Site. The Elgin Site includes both an office building and a warehouse. We are currently attempting to find additional tenants for the available space in the office building at the
Elgin Site. Until additional tenant(s) are found, we will not receive the benefit of rental income associated with such space. Approximately 63% of the rentable area in the office building is currently vacant, of which approximately 29% has not been
built-out. There can be no assurance that we will be able to lease the unoccupied space and further capital expenditures will likely be necessary to lease the remaining space. 
Financing Arrangements  On February 7, 2008,
we entered into the Credit Facility with a bank group (the Bank Lenders) providing a $117.5 million revolving loan commitment and letter of credit subfacility. Also on February 7, 2008, we entered into a Loan Agreement with an
insurance company (the Mortgage Lender) providing us with two term loans, one in the amount of $36.0 million (Tranche A) and the other in the amount of $9.0 million (Tranche B), for an aggregate amount
of $45.0 million (the Mortgage Facility).  On November 29, 2017, we entered into the Consent and Ninth Amendment to our Credit
Agreement (the Ninth Amendment) which provided lender consent to incur unsecured debt in connection with our acquisition of the assets of the Squirrel Brand business, and for the acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business to constitute a
Permitted Acquisition under the terms of the Credit Facility. The Ninth Amendment also modified our collateral reporting requirements.

The Credit Facility, as most recently amended in November 2017, is secured by substantially all of our
assets other than machinery and equipment, real property, and fixtures and matures on July 7, 2021. The Mortgage Facility is secured by mortgages on essentially all of our owned real property located in Elgin, Illinois, Gustine, California and
Garysburg, North Carolina (the Encumbered Properties).  Credit Facility 
At our election, borrowings under the Credit Facility currently accrue interest at either (i) a rate determined pursuant to the administrative
agents prime rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the amount of loans which may be advanced under the borrowing base calculation, ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% or (ii) a rate based upon the London interbank offered rate
(LIBOR) plus an applicable margin based upon the borrowing base calculation, ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%.  At December 26, 2019, the
weighted average interest rate for the Credit Facility was 3.8%. The terms of the Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, require us to restrict investments, indebtedness, acquisitions and certain sales of assets and limit annual
cash dividends or distributions, transactions with affiliates, redemptions of capital stock and prepayment of indebtedness (if such prepayment, among other things, is of a subordinate debt). If loan availability under the borrowing base calculation
falls below $25.0 million, we will be required to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio, tested on a monthly basis, until loan availability equals or exceeds $25.0 million for three consecutive months. All cash received from
customers is required to be applied against the Credit Facility. The Bank Lenders have the option to accelerate and demand immediate repayment of our obligations under the Credit Facility in the event of default on the payments required under the
Credit Facility, a change in control in the ownership of the Company, non-compliance with the financial covenant or upon the occurrence of other defaults by us under the Credit Facility (including a default
under the Mortgage Facility). As of December 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and we currently expect to be in compliance with the financial covenant in the Credit Facility for the foreseeable future.
At December 26, 2019, we had $100.8 million of available credit under the Credit Facility. If this entire amount were borrowed at December 26, 2019, we would still be in compliance with all restrictive covenants under the Credit
Facility.  We are currently updating the Credit Facility agreement and expect the term to extend another five years. The legal costs incurred to date have
been capitalized and will be amortized over the length of the new agreement.  Mortgage Facility 
The Mortgage Facility matures on March 1, 2023. On March 1, 2018 the interest rate on the Mortgage Facility was fixed at 4.25% per annum for the
remainder of the term. Monthly principal payments on Tranche A in the amount of $0.2 million commenced on June 1, 2008. Monthly principal payments on Tranche B in the amount of $0.1 million commenced on June 1, 2008. 
The terms of the Mortgage Facility contain covenants that require us to maintain a specified net worth of $110.0 million and maintain the Encumbered
Properties. The Mortgage Lender is entitled to require immediate repayment of our obligations under the Mortgage Facility in the event we default in the payments required under the Mortgage Facility,
non-compliance with the covenants or upon the occurrence of certain other defaults by us under the Mortgage Facility. As of December 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Mortgage
Facility.  Selma Property  In September 2006, we sold
our Selma, Texas properties (the Selma Properties) to two related party partnerships for $14.3 million and are leasing them back. The selling price was determined by an independent appraiser to be the fair market value which also
approximated our carrying value. The lease for the Selma Properties has a ten-year term at a fair market value rent with three five-year renewal options. In September 2015, we exercised two of the five-year
renewal options which extended the lease term to September 2026. The lease extension also reduced the monthly lease payment on the Selma Properties, beginning in September 2016, to reflect then current market conditions. One five-year renewal option
remains. Also, we have an option to purchase the Selma Properties from the owner at 95% (100% in certain circumstances) of the then fair market value, but not less than the original $14.3 million purchase price. The provisions of the
arrangement are not eligible for sale-leaseback accounting and the $14.3 million was recorded as a debt obligation. No gain or loss was recorded on the Selma Properties transaction. As of December 26, 2019, $9.8 million of the debt
obligation was outstanding.

Squirrel Brand Seller-Financed Note 
In November 2017 we completed the Acquisition. The Acquisition was financed by a combination of cash (drawn under the Credit Facility) and a three-year
seller-financed note for $11.5 million (Promissory Note). The principal owner and seller of the Squirrel Brand business was subsequently appointed as an executive officer of the Company and was considered a related party until the
employment of this executive officer with the Company ceased late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Promissory Note is unsecured, bears interest at 5.5% per annum and is payable in equal monthly principal payments of $0.3 million, plus
interest, which began in January 2018. Upon an event of default, as defined in the Promissory Note, the interest rate increases to 7.5% until such event of default is cured. We can pre-pay the Promissory Note
at any time during the three-year period without penalty. At December 26, 2019, the principal amount of $3.5 million of the Promissory Note was outstanding.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  There has been no material change in our assessment of our sensitivity to market risk since our presentation set forth in Part IItem 7A
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2019.
