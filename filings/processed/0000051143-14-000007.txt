Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The
financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the
company's management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
     
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake
in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be
different from these estimates. Refer to the company's 2013 Annual Report on
pages 67 to 70 for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
     
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full
year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the company's 2013 Annual Report.
 
     
Noncontrolling interest amounts in income of $2.4 million and $0.9 million, net of tax, for
the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $1.9 million and $2.3 million, net of tax, for
the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are included in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense line
item.
 
     
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows
may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.
Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. This is annotated where applicable.
  

 
2. Accounting
Changes:  In May 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on the
recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue recognition will
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures
regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of
adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance
recognized at the date of initial application. The guidance is effective
January 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new guidance and the method of adoption in the
consolidated financial results.
       In April 2014, the FASB
issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting a discontinued
operation. Only disposals of a component that represents a strategic shift that
has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial
results is a discontinued operation. The guidance also requires expanded
disclosures about discontinued operations and disposals of a significant part
of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The
guidance is effective January 1, 2015 with early adoption permitted, but only
for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported
in previously-issued financial statements. The impact to the company will be
dependent on any transaction that is within the scope of the new guidance.
       In July 2013, the FASB issued
guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net
operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward
exists. Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits should be
presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset
for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward. The guidance was effective January 1, 2014.  The
guidance was a change in financial statement presentation only and did not have
a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 
  In March 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on when foreign currency translation adjustments should be
released to net income. When a parent entity ceases to have a controlling financial
interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign
entity, the parent is required to release any related cumulative translation
adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment
should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the
complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which
the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The guidance was effective January 1,
2014 and did not have a material impact in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position.  
     In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of
the guidance is 

9



Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

fixed at the reporting date. Examples
include debt arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation
matters. The guidance requires an entity to measure such obligations as the sum
of the amount that the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its
arrangement among its co-obligors plus additional amounts the reporting entity
expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance was effective
January 1, 2014 and did not have a material impact in the consolidated
financial results.
 
3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
       The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 
       Certain financial assets
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity
method investments that are recognized at fair value at the measurement date to
the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale
equity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In
the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a financial investment, fair
value is measured using a model described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. See note A, “Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment,” on
page 88 in the company’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information.
There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the six months
ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

      
Accounting guidance permits the measurement of eligible financial assets,
financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be
accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. This election is
irrevocable. The company has not applied the fair value option to any eligible
assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2014 and December 31,
2013.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and
Payables
 
Notes and
other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with
carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued
expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt)
are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If
measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments
would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.   
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
       Fair values are based
on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for
similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining
maturities. At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the difference between the
carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables
was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these
financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

 
Long-term
Debt
 
       Fair value of
publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the
identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other
long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected
present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair
value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $34,008 million and $32,856 million, and the estimated
fair value was $36,367 million and $34,555 million at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial
statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified
as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity
Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities
are considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position. 
 
       During the first
quarter of 2014, the company acquired equity investments in conjunction with
the sale of the customer care business which are classified as trading
securities. Unrealized gains related to trading securities of $15 million and $21 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2014 and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively,
were recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings.

     The contractual
maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less

Derivative
Financial Instruments 
 
       The
company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender
and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the
company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and
client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and,
where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are
denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align
rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease
and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing
debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a
liability position at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $150 million and
$216 million, respectively, for which no collateral was posted at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013.  Full collateralization of these agreements would be
required in the event that the company’s credit rating falls below investment
grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The
aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in net asset positions as of
June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $772 million and $719 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This
exposure was reduced by $184 million and $251 million at June 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting
arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at June 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, this exposure was reduced by $42 million and $29 million of
cash collateral, respectively, received by the company. At June 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $528 million and $439
million, respectively.  At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the net
exposure related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position was $158 million and $250 million,
respectively.  
 

14



Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

       In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position,
the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master
netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon
payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related
derivative instruments. No amount was recognized in other receivables at June
30, 2014 or December 31, 2013 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The
amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash
collateral totaled $42 million and $29 million at June 30, 2014 and December
31, 2013, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash collateral
received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and
other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No
amount was rehypothecated at June 30, 2014 or at December 31, 2013.  At June
30, 2014, the company held $19 million in non-cash collateral in U.S. Treasury
securities, and at December 31, 2013, no amounts of non-cash collateral were
held.   
 
       The
company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in
stockholders’ equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of
significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S.
dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the
company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact
upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the
underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an
ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by de-designating
or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize
derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the de-designated
instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts,
interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the
underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative
instruments.
 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk,
follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The
company issues debt in the global capital markets, principally to fund its
financing lease and loan portfolios. Access to cost-effective financing can
result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these
mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate
swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt
(i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances
into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At June 30, 2014 and December
31, 2013, the total notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps was
$5.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining
maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was
approximately 9.2 years and 10.6 years, respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The
company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To
manage this risk, the company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to
lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt
issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did
not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at
June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
       At June
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, net gains of approximately $1 million (before
taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings.
Within these amounts, gains of less than $1 million, respectively, are expected
to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying transactions.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large
portion of the company’s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is
designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the
volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with
respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and
foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At June
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments designated as net investment hedges was $4.1 billion and $3.0
billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these
instruments at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was approximately 0.3 years
and 0.4 years, respectively.

15



Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

 
Anticipated
Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The
company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party
vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services
among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In
anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility
of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange
forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the
company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four
years. At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of
forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost
transactions was $9.9 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, with a
weighted-average remaining maturity of 0.7 years for both periods.
 
       At June
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, in connection with cash flow hedges of
anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net losses of
$131 million and $252 million (before taxes), respectively, in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $152 million and $166
million of losses, respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net income
within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the
underlying anticipated transactions. 
 
Foreign
Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
       The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert
fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in
the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has
hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately
seven years. At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount
of cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency
denominated debt was $1.2 billion for both periods.
 
       At June
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign
currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $26 million
(before taxes) and $9 million (before taxes), respectively, in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $4 million of losses
and $3 million of losses, respectively, is expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying exposure.           
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The
company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its
subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash
flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign
exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign
currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets
and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally
less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of
the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in
other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $16.6 billion
and $14.7 billion, respectively. 
 
Equity Risk
Management
 
       The
company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and
in the company’s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to
employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation
obligations are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and
futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee
compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on
certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock,
and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.3 billion for both
periods.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

Other Risks
 
       The
company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with
various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share
or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair
value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as
derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
       The
company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due
under contractual terms. The company may utilize credit default swaps to
economically hedge its credit exposures. The swaps are recorded at fair value
with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2014 and December
31, 2013.
 
       The
company is exposed to market volatility on certain investment securities.  The
company may utilize options to economically hedge its market exposure.  The
options are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other
(income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  At June 30,
2014 the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of
investment securities was $0.1 billion.  No amounts were outstanding under this
program at December 31, 2013. 
 
       The
following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and
non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity as of June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, as well as for the three and six months ended June 30,
2014 and 2013, respectively:

Net investment in sales-type and
direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$730 million and $737 million at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of
$612 million and $672 million, and net of the
allowance for credit losses of $149 million and $123 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $18 million and $23 million at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), net of allowance for
credit losses of $306 million and $242 million at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to
clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment
terms on these financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally from one
to seven years.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables financing contracts are priced
independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $671 million and $769 million at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing
receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at June 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013. The company determines its allowance for credit
losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan receivables,
and further segments the portfolio into two classes: major markets and growth
markets. For additional information on the company’s accounting policies for
the allowance for credit losses, refer to the company’s 2013 Annual Report on
pages 92 and 93.

       When
determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an
individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the
company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an
estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts
in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. In
addition, the company records an unallocated reserve that is determined by
applying a reserve rate to its different portfolios, excluding accounts that
have been specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history. 
 
Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
       Certain receivables for which the company has recorded a
specific reserve may also be placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual assets
are those receivables with specific reserves and other accounts for  which it is likely
that the company will

be unable to collect all amounts
due according to original terms of the lease or loan agreement. Income
recognition is discontinued on these receivables. 
 
       The following table presents the recorded investment in
financing receivables which were on non-accrual status at June 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating
agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers,
are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting
indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information
provided by Standard & Poor’s, where available, as one of many inputs in
its determination of customer credit ratings.
 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at June 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from AAA
to BBB- are considered investment grade. All others are considered
non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation
actions that the company may take to transfer credit risk to third parties.

       The decrease in pre-tax stock-based
compensation cost for the three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year, was due to decreases related to
restricted stock units ($10 million), performance
share units ($5 million) and the company’s
assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($4 million). The decrease in
the pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30,
2014, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was due to
decreases related to restricted stock units ($19 million), performance
share units ($12 million) and the company’s
assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($8 million).
 
       As of June 30,
2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,184 million related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.6 years.
 
    
 There
was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at June 30, 2014
and 2013.
 
6. Segments:  
The tables on pages 27 and 28 reflect the results of operations of the
company’s segments consistent with the management and measurement system
utilized within the company. Performance measurement is based on pre-tax
income. These results are used, in part, by senior management, both in evaluating
the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

       On March 24, 2014, the Supreme Court
of Spain issued a ruling against IBM Spain in litigation involving its defined
benefit and defined contribution plans. See page 43 for additional information.
As a result of the ruling, the company recorded an additional pre-tax
retirement-related obligation of $55 million in the first
quarter of 2014 in selling, general and administrative expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This charge is not reflected in operating
(non-GAAP) expense. This obligation is reflected in "Non-U.S. Plans -
Multi-employer plans/other costs" in the six months table above. To date,
the rulings in this case are declaratory only and there have been no
quantifications of any individual remedies.
 
       In March 2014, the company initiated a
change to the investment strategy of its U.S. defined benefit plan. The 2014
target asset allocation was modified, primarily by reducing equity securities
from 42 percent to 32 percent, and increasing
debt securities from 47 percent to 57 percent of total plan
assets, respectively. The asset allocation change was substantially completed
by March 31, 2014. This change was designed to reduce the potential negative
impact that equity markets might have on the funded status of the U.S. defined benefit
plan. The change is expected to reduce the 2015 expected long-term rate of
return on assets to approximately 7.75 percent. See note S,
"Retirement-Related Benefits," on page 135 in the company's 2013
Annual Report for additional information regarding the company's investment
strategy.         
 
       In 2014, the company expects to contribute to its
non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans approximately $600 million, which will be
mainly contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in Japan, the UK,
Switzerland and the Netherlands. This amount represents the legally mandated
minimum contributions. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the
first six months of 2014 were $257 million.

        In
connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (the ‘Act’), the company qualified to receive a subsidy through
2013. Due to benefit plan changes effective January 1, 2014, the company no
longer qualifies for the subsidy as of that date. The company is expected to
receive additional subsidies after 2013 to true up the final subsidy amount due
to IBM under the Act. The company received
a $17.6 million subsidy in the
second quarter of 2014 and a $23.0 million subsidy for the
first six months of 2014.  For further information related to the Act, refer to page 141
in the company’s 2013 Annual Report.    
 
9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
 
Acquisitions: During the six months
ended June 30, 2014, the company completed four acquisitions at an aggregate
cost of $571 million.
   
        The Software
segment completed acquisitions of four privately held companies: in the first
quarter, Aspera, Inc. (Aspera) and Cloudant, Inc. (Cloudant); and in the second
quarter, Silverpop Systems, Inc. (Silverpop) and Cognea Group Pty LTD (Cognea).
All acquisitions were for 100 percent of the acquired companies.
 
       The following
table reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the
resulting purchase price allocations as of June 30, 2014:

Each acquisition
further complemented and enhanced the company’s portfolio of product and services
offerings.  Aspera’s technology makes cloud computing faster, more predictable
and more cost effective for big data transfers such as enterprise storage,
sharing virtual images or accessing the cloud for increased computing capacity.
Cloudant will extend the company’s mobile and cloud platform by enabling
developers to easily and quickly create next generation mobile and web-based
applications. Silverpop is a provider of cloud-based capabilities that deliver
personalized customer engagements in highly scalable environments. Cognea
offers personalized artificial intelligence capabilities designed to serve as
an intuitive interface between human users and data-driven information.
Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions as reflected in the table
above, is paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash
equivalents.  
       The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity was recorded at
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify
as an amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life of the
identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 6.8 years. These
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Goodwill of $417 million has been assigned to the Software
segment. It is expected that none of the goodwill will be deductible for tax
purposes. 
 
Divestitures: 
 
        On January 23,
2014, IBM and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) announced a definitive
agreement in which Lenovo will acquire the company’s industry standard x86
server portfolio for $2.3 billion, consisting of approximately $2 billion in
cash, with the balance in Lenovo common stock. The stock will represent less
than 5 percent equity ownership in Lenovo. The company will sell to Lenovo its
System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade servers and switches, x86-based
Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and iDataPlex servers and associated
software, blade networking and maintenance operations.
 
  IBM and Lenovo plan to enter into a strategic
relationship which will include a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales
of IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems,
tape storage systems, General Parallel File System software, SmartCloud Entry
offering, and elements of IBM’s system software, including Systems Director and
Platform Computing solutions. Following the closing of the transaction, Lenovo
will assume related customer service and maintenance operations. IBM will
continue to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s behalf for an extended
period of time.
 
  The transaction will be completed as soon as
is practical, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements, customary
closing conditions and any other required approvals. At June 30, 2014, the
company is engaged in the regulatory review process and in the activities
necessary to separate the tangible assets and prepare such assets for sale in
order to close the transaction. The transaction is expected to be completed in
phases, with the initial closing expected in the second half of 2014.
Subsequent local closings will occur subject to similar conditions, agreements
and the information and consultation process in applicable countries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

  The company expects
to recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1 billion. This
gain will be recognized consistent with the closing schedule for the
transaction. The exact amount of the gain and the breakdown by closing date is
not yet determinable. The variables that can impact the final gain and the
financial statements overall include the valuation of the final balance sheet
transferred, the valuation of other related agreements, any impacts resulting
from the finalization of regulatory reviews and transaction-related expenses.
In addition, the total impact to pre-tax income as a result of the divestiture
will reflect other costs, such as performance-related compensation, to the
extent impacted by the recognition of the divestiture gain. 
 
  The company’s worldwide x86 business is
reported in the Systems and Technology segment, and the associated maintenance
operations are part of the Global Technology Services segment. In 2013, this
combined business delivered approximately $4.6 billion of revenue, was essentially
breakeven on a pre-tax income basis and had approximately $100 million in
tangible assets.
 
       On September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a
definitive agreement in which SYNNEX will acquire the company’s worldwide
customer care business process outsourcing services business for $501 million,
consisting of approximately $430 million in cash, net of balance sheet
adjustments, and $71 million in SYNNEX common stock, which represents less than
5 percent equity ownership in SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered
into a multi-year agreement with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s
outsourcing business, has become an IBM strategic business partner for global
customer care business process outsourcing services. 
 
       The transaction is being completed in phases. The
initial closing was completed in January 2014 and the company recognized a
pre-tax gain of $98 million in the first quarter. In April 2014, the company
completed the second closing which resulted in an additional pre-tax gain of $121 million. A final
closing is expected to occur in the second half of 2014, with a minimal amount
of additional pre-tax gain expected to be recognized. 
 
       On April 17, 2012, the company
announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba TEC for the
sale of its Retail Store Solutions business. As part of the transaction, the
company agreed to transfer the maintenance business to Toshiba TEC within three
years of the original closing of the transaction.
 
       In the second quarter of 2014, the
company completed the second phase of the transfer of the maintenance workforce
to Toshiba. Subsequent wave closings are scheduled to be completed through the
first quarter of 2015 along with associated parts and inventory transfer. The
second phase transfer and an assessment of the ongoing contractual terms of the
overall transaction resulted in the recognition of an additional pre-tax gain
of $2 million in the second quarter of 2014. For the first six months of 2014,
the company has recognized a total pre-tax gain of $36 million.
 
       The company expects to close the final
phase of the divestiture in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, the company
expects to recognize a cumulative total pre-tax gain on the sale of
approximately $508 million.
 
       On June 30, 2014, the company completed the
divestiture of its Solid DB suite of products to UNICOM. The company acquired
this product set through the acquisition of Solid Information Technology in
2008, which is within the Software segment. Also on June 30, 2014, the company
completed the divestiture of its Human Capital Management business line in
France to Sopra Group. This business line was within the Global Business
Services segment. Financial details for both transactions were not material.

* Other intangibles are primarily acquired
proprietary and non-proprietary business processes, methodologies and systems.   
 
     The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$286 million during the first six months of 2014, primarily due to
amortization, partially offset by intangible asset additions resulting from
acquisitions. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $340 million
and $679 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2014,
respectively, versus $326 million and $657 million for the second quarter and
first six months of 2013, respectively. In addition, in the first six months of
2014, the company retired $337 million of fully amortized intangible assets,
impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this
amount.  
 
     The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following
at June 30, 2014:

         Note: The 2014-2015 maturities at 12/31/2013 includes $17 million of debt securities issued by IBM
International Group Capital, LLC, which is an indirect, 100 percent owned finance
subsidiary of the company which matured in the first half of 2014. Debt
securities issued by IBM International Group Capital LLC are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the company.  
*      The portion of the company’s
fixed-rate debt obligations that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position as an amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying
value plus a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of
the hedged debt obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest
rates.
 
       The company’s indenture governing its debt
securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants
which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the
aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10 percent of the company’s
consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge
or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also
include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio,
which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 
       The company is in compliance with all of its
significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its
lenders.  The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an
event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply.  If
certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt
to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and
payable.

13.  Contingencies:  As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries,
IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a
leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will
continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated
products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement
and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company
enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations,
lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and
scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions
involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters
related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may
involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel
questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters
arise.
 
       The company records a
provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such
liabilities for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 were not material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

41



Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

 
       In accordance with the
relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for
which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In
addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of
other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other
companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations
considerations.
 
       With respect to certain
of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the
company believes at this time that the likelihood of any material loss is
remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the
strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With respect to the
remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed in this Note,
the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or
range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the
following reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters. It is the company’s experience that damage amounts claimed in
litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as
such are not meaningful indicators of the company’s potential liability.
Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of
other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in
question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing
discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company
reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and
decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing
reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the
aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions,
discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other
information pertinent to a particular matter.
 
       Whether any losses,
damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the company’s business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a
number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or
damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the
impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated
Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular
matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will
continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the company’s business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in
any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
       The following is a
summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company.
 
       The company is a
defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City,
Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to Federal
Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of
AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its
decision. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and
all proceedings in this case were stayed. On August 25, 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware approved the appointment of a Trustee of
SCO. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a
trial in March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and
UnixWare copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to
recognize Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of
UNIX license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In
June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v.
IBM case.  On July 10, 2013, the Court entered an
order dismissing 7 of SCO's 10 claims, specifically its breach of contract and
copyright claims, and one tortious interference claim.
 
       On May 13, 2010, IBM
and the State of Indiana (acting on behalf of the Indiana Family and Social
Services Administration) sued one another in a dispute over a 2006 contract
regarding the modernization of social service program processing in Indiana.
The State terminated the contract, claiming that IBM was in breach, and the
State is seeking damages. IBM believes the State’s claims against it are
without merit and is seeking payment of termination amounts specified in the
contract. After six weeks of trial, on July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior
Court in Marion County rejected the State’s claims in their entirety and
awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On
February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed portions of the trial
judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and ordered the case remanded
to the trial judge to determine the State's damages, if any. The Indiana Court
of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial court's award
of damages to IBM. This matter remains pending in the Indiana courts.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

        On April 16, 2014,
Iusacell SA de C.V. (Iusacell) sued IBM, claiming that IBM made fraudulent
misrepresentations that induced Iusacell to enter into an agreement with IBM
Mexico. Iusacell claims $2.5 billion in damages for lost profits. Iusacell’s
complaint relates to a contractual dispute in Mexico, which is the subject of a
pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico initiated by IBM Mexico against
Iusacell for breach of the underlying agreement.
 
       IBM United Kingdom
Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal proceedings in May 2010 before the High Court
in London against the IBM UK Pensions Trust (the UK Trust) and two
representative beneficiaries of the UK Trust membership. IBM UK is seeking a
declaration that it acted lawfully both in notifying the Trustee of the UK
Trust that it was closing its UK defined benefit plans to future accruals for
most participants and in implementing the company’s new retirement policy. On
April 4, 2014, the High Court acknowledged that the changes made to its UK
defined benefit plans were within IBM’s discretion, but ruled that IBM breached
its implied duty of good faith both in implementing these changes and in the
manner in which it consulted with employees. Proceedings to determine remedies
began on July 21, 2014. In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290
individual actions brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined
benefits plans who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive
dismissal and age discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in
Southampton UK.
 
       In a separate but
related proceeding, in March 2011, the Trustee of the IBM UK Trust was granted
leave to initiate a claim before the High Court in London against IBM UK and
one member of the UK Trust membership, seeking an order modifying certain
documents and terms relating to retirement provisions in IBM UK’s largest
defined benefit plan (the C Plan) dating back to 1983. The trial of these
proceedings began in May 2012 and finished in early June. On October 12, 2012,
the High Court in London issued its ruling, holding that the 1983 Trust Deeds
and Rules should be modified to allow certain categories of current IBM UK
employees who are members of the C Plan to retire from the age of 60 (rather
than from the age of 63) without actuarial reduction of their defined benefit
pension. In a supplementary ruling on December 13, 2012, the Court declined to
similarly modify the Trust Deeds and Rules for former employees who were C Plan
members and who left the company prior to retirement. On February 7, 2013, the
Court issued an order agreed to by all parties, under which there will be no
appeals of the October 2012 and December 2012 judgments. As a result of the
October 2012 ruling, IBM recorded an additional pre-tax retirement-related
obligation of $162 million in the third quarter of 2012.
 
       On March 24, 2014, in a suit brought by local Works Councils, the
Supreme Court of Spain held that IBM Spain’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan
implemented in 1993 was null and void, and held that current employees could
reinstate their rights to a Defined Benefit (DB) Plan, although with an offset
for DC contributions paid to date.  The Court held that IBM Spain did not
consult with the Works Councils in seeking the voluntary participation of
employees in changing the pension scheme, and recommended that IBM Spain and
the Works Councils engage in discussions over how to carry out the offset. The ruling
is declaratory only and there have been no quantifications of, or suits for,
individual remedies. IBM Spain has requested leave to appeal the decision to
the Constitutional Court and has started discussions with the Works Councils.
 
        In March 2011, the company announced that it had agreed to
settle a civil enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) relating to alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977. On July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011 settlement and required
that for a two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC and the court on certain
matters, including those relating to compliance with the FCPA. In early 2012,
IBM notified the SEC of an investigation by the Polish Central Anti-Corruption
Bureau involving allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM Poland
employee in connection with sales to the Polish government. IBM is cooperating
with the SEC and Polish authorities in this matter. In April 2013, IBM learned
that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating allegations related to the Poland matter, as well as
allegations relating to transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The
DOJ is also seeking information regarding the company's global FCPA compliance program
and its public sector business. The company is
cooperating with the DOJ in this matter.
 
       In May
2013, IBM learned that the SEC was conducting an investigation into how IBM
reports cloud revenue. On May 30, 2014, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC
informed IBM that it had concluded its investigation. IBM was notified that
based on the information to date, the Division of Enforcement did not intend to
recommend any enforcement action by the SEC against IBM. 
 
       In December
2013, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York related to the company's
third-quarter 2013 financial results disclosure. On May 2, 2014, plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed the suit without prejudice.
 
        The company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after
January 1, 2008 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of
Broome, on behalf of hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and
different causes of action, including for negligence and recklessness, private
nuisance and trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring

and claim damages in unspecified amounts for a variety of
personal injuries and property damages allegedly arising out of the presence of
groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants into
certain structures in which plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted
business, allegedly resulting from the release of chemicals into the
environment by the company at its former manufacturing and development facility
in Endicott. These complaints also seek punitive damages in an unspecified
amount. 
 
       The company is party
to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state
environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or laws similar
to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate
in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The
company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or
remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites
globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country,
state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims
concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
       The company is also
subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various
jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil,
the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian authorities
regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The
total potential amount related to these matters for all applicable years is
approximately $710 million. The company believes it will prevail on these
matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.    
 
14. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $5,610 million and $5,028 million at June 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available
to the company’s business partners to support their working capital needs. In
addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients
in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $1,759 million
and $1,769 million at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
 
       The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 
       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the
assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the
company’s payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the
company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by
the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $43 million and $44 million at June 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.
 
       Changes in the company’s warranty
liability for standard warranties and deferred income for extended warranty
contracts are presented in the following tables:

Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on pages 75 and 76 for additional information.
 
Operating
(non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
        In an effort to provide better transparency into the
operational results of the business, the company separates business results
into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP
measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges and
retirement-related costs, and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions,
operating earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and
acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development,
transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses and tax
charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the
company characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating.
The company includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit
plan service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined
contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost
includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan
interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial
gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and
multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs and other costs.
Non-operating costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and
liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and the company
considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the
business.

 

46



Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

       Overall, the company believes that providing
investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides
increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the
business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves
visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational
performance; enables better comparisons to peer companies; and allows the
company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward.
For its 2015 road map, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish
its objectives and track its progress. The company’s reportable segment
financial results reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company’s
management and measurement system.

Financial Performance
Summary:
 
       In the second quarter of
2014, the company reported $24.4 billion in revenue and delivered diluted
earnings per share of $4.12 as reported and $4.32 on an operating (non-GAAP)
basis. The company generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations and $3.0
billion in free cash flow in the second quarter driving shareholder returns of
$4.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 
 
       The company’s
performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2014 reflected the stability
of the overall business model as the company continued its transformation. From
a portfolio perspective:


·        
The company continued to drive
double-digit revenue growth in the parts of the business that address the
emerging trends in enterprise IT.
·        
The core franchises were stable,
where the company continues to drive innovation.
·        
The company is dealing with
secular shifts in parts of its hardware business.
·        
The divested customer care
business has had an impact as the company shifts to higher value.
 
       In the first quarter of
2014, the company announced a number of initiatives to support the shift to the
strategic imperatives of data, cloud and systems of engagement. These included:
 


·        
The launch of Bluemix, the
company’s cloud platform-as-a-service for the enterprise.
·        
A $1.2 billion investment to
globally expand SoftLayer cloud hubs.
·        
A $1 billion investment to bring
Watson’s cognitive capabilities to the enterprise. 


In
the second quarter of 2014, the company made progress implementing these
initiatives including:
 
·        
Bluemix becoming generally
available in June.
·        
New SoftLayer data centers were
opened.
·        
POWER8 began to ship, and the
OpenPOWER consortium doubled its membership.
·        
Substantially completing the
divestiture of the customer care business. 
 
       In July, the company
announced additional actions to continue the shift to higher value, including:
 
·       
An investment of $3 billion over
the next five years in research and early stage development to create the next
generation of semiconductor chip technologies that will fuel the systems
required for cloud, big data and cognitive systems.

47



Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

·       
A strategic global partnership
with Apple to provide a new level of business value from mobility for
enterprise clients. 
        
       The underlying theme of
these actions – from the expansion of the cloud platforms and capacity, to the
OpenPOWER consortium, to the partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility, to
next generation chip technologies – is that the company is leveraging its
unique strengths in innovation and enterprise capabilities to maintain its
differentiation in the emerging areas of enterprise IT.  While some of these
actions impact results in the short term, they position the business better for
the long term. 
 
       In the second quarter,
total consolidated revenue decreased 2.2 percent, 2.5 percent at constant
currency. Adjusting for the divested customer care business, revenue decreased
1 percent at constant currency. From a segment perspective, Software revenue
increased 1.0 percent (flat adjusted for currency), driven by middleware which
increased 3.4 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency). The company is
continuing to drive strong results in the strategic areas of mobile and
security, as well as in some of the core franchises, including application
servers and distributed databases. Global Services revenue declined 1.4 percent
as reported and at constant currency; adjusting for the divested customer care
business, Global Services revenue increased 1 percent at constant currency.
Global Technology Services (GTS) revenue decreased 1.3 percent as reported and
at constant currency; adjusting for the divested customer care business, GTS
revenue increased 2 percent at constant currency from growth in cloud offerings
and large outsourcing contracts signed in 2013. Global Business Services
decreased 1.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), with strong growth in
the practices that address the digital front office, however performance in the
traditional packaged application implementation offerings lagged. Systems and
Technology revenue decreased 11.4 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency)
but improved significantly sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2014
driven by System z mainframe, System x and Storage. 
 
       From a geographic
perspective, revenue in the growth markets declined 6.8 percent as reported and
4 percent adjusted for currency, a 1 point sequential improvement from the
first quarter at constant currency. Within the growth markets, the BRIC
countries decreased 1.9 percent as reported, but increased 1 percent at
constant currency; a 7 point improvement from the first quarter 2014. 
 
       The consolidated gross
profit margin increased 0.5 points versus the second quarter of 2013 to 49.1
percent. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 49.8 percent increased 0.1
points year to year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by margin
expansion in Global Technology Services and an improved mix toward Software,
partially offset by margin declines in Global Business Services and Systems and
Technology. Operating (non-GAAP) gross profit of $12.1 billion declined
approximately $250 million year to year driven entirely by Systems and
Technology; excluding Systems and Technology, gross profit was flat year to
year in the second quarter, including a $70 million impact from the divested
customer care business, and while the company continues to transition to
emerging areas where the profit and margins will benefit from scale.  
 
       Total expense and other
(income) decreased 14.8 percent in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the
prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased
14.0 percent year to year. The year-to-year drivers were approximately:

       There was one significant item that had an impact on total
expense and other (income) year to year. Workforce rebalancing charges in the
second quarter of 2013 were $1.0 billion compared to $11 million in the current
year. Adjusting for the workforce rebalancing charges, operating (non-GAAP)
base expense would have improved by 5 points compared to the 17 point impact
highlighted above. The 5 point improvement is a better indication of the
productivity in the base expense. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2014
the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $121 million related to the divestiture
of the customer care business. Within base expense, the company is continuing
to shift its spending to drive the strategic

imperatives
and differentiated offerings. The substantial investments being made in cloud,
which includes Bluemix and new data centers, in Watson and in chip innovation
are examples of this.    
 
       Pre-tax income increased 24.8 percent year to year and the
pre-tax margin was 21.2 percent, an increase of 4.6 points versus the second
quarter of 2013. Net income increased 28.2 percent and the net income margin
was 17.0 percent, an increase of 4.0 points year to year. The effective tax
rate for the second quarter was 20.0 percent, a decrease of 2.1 points year to
year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income increased 18.3 percent year to year
and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin was 22.3 percent, an increase of
3.9 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) net income increased 21.3 percent
and the operating (non-GAAP) net income margin of 17.8 percent increased 3.5
points compared to the prior year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate
was 20.0 percent versus 22.0 percent in the second quarter of 2013.The pre-tax
income and net income margin improvements include the impact of the charge in
the second quarter of 2013 of $1 billion for workforce rebalancing. 
 
       Diluted earnings per share of $4.12 increased 41.6 percent
versus the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $4.32
increased 34.2 percent versus the second quarter of 2013. In the second
quarter, the company repurchased 16.6 million shares of its common stock. 
      
     The company generated $3,579 million
in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $405 million
compared to the second quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower uses of cash
for receivables and lower cash tax payments. Net cash used in investing
activities of $1,000 million increased $137 million compared to the prior year,
primarily due to lower proceeds received from net sales of short-term
marketable securities. Net cash used in financing activities of $2,260 million
decreased $1,067 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher
net cash proceeds from total debt.
 
       In July 2014, the company stated
that it is expecting GAAP earnings per share of at least $17.00 and operating
(non-GAAP) earnings of at least $18.00 per diluted share for the full year
2014. The company has also stated that its earnings per share expectation does
not include the expected gain from the divestiture of its System x server
business to Lenovo due to the uncertainty of the timing and the amount. The
gain will ultimately be reflected in the company’s results, and the company
will provide an update later in the year.

Financial
Performance Summary:
 
       In the first six
months of 2014, the company reported revenue of $46.8 billion, expanded margins
and delivered diluted earnings per share of $6.37 as reported and $6.82 on an
operating (non-GAAP) basis while shifting investment to key areas. The company
generated $6.9 billion in cash from operations and $3.6 billion in free cash
flow in the first six months of 2014 driving shareholder returns of $13.9
billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends.
 
      
Total consolidated revenue decreased 3.1 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to the first six months of 2013. Adjusting for the divested
customer care business, revenue decreased 1 percent at constant currency. The
company has a set of offerings that address the strategic areas of data, cloud
and the way clients are engaging with their customers. The company’s business
model is to deliver double-digit revenue growth for these areas – with high
software content.  Results in the first half of 2014 were consistent with that
part of the model. Business analytics revenue increased 7 percent on a large
base, and cloud revenue was up over 50 percent, with the “delivered as a
service” business doubling again. Security revenue increased over 20 percent,
and mobile revenue more than doubled year to year. Combined, revenue in the
strategic imperatives was up double-digits, with approximately half of the
content in software. The company also continues to innovate in its core
franchises. These include the longer term services business, the recurring
software business and the mainframe business with its large capacity clients.
The model for the core franchises is stable revenue, and the first half of 2014
results reflect that the company is on track. In the transactional businesses
that are shifting to higher value, the portfolio is continuing to evolve – the
company is investing in capabilities in some areas, while divesting businesses
that do not

support the shift to higher value. In the
first half of 2014, the company substantially completed the divestiture of the
customer care business – and announced the sale of its industry standard x86
server business to Lenovo. These transactions impact the company’s revenue
performance, but position the business for the long term.
 
       The company
continues to drive these shifts. For example, in the first half of the year:               
 
·        
Bluemix went
live, new SoftLayer cloud hubs were added and investment is being ramped up to
commercialize Watson.
·        
POWER8 was
introduced for big data and cloud at the entry level and the OpenPOWER
consortium doubled its membership.
·        
The company committed
$3 billion in spending over the next five years to drive chip innovation, while
launching a global new partnership with Apple to extend the company’s position
in the enterprise mobile space.  


      
From a segment perspective, Software revenue increased 1.3 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency) year to year driven by middleware which increased 3.3
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency). Global Services revenue declined 1.7
percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). Adjusted for the divested customer
care business, Global Services revenue increased 1 percent at constant
currency. Global Technology Services (GTS) declined 2.1 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency); adjusting for the divested customer care business, GTS
revenue increased 2 percent at constant currency. Global Business Services
revenue decreased 0.8 percent as reported, flat adjusted for currency. Systems
and Technology revenue decreased 16.6 percent (17 percent adjusted for
currency) from a combination of secular and cyclical challenges in the hardware
business. System z mainframe revenue decreased 16.4 percent (17 percent
adjusted for currency). Global Financing revenue increased 3.1 percent (5
percent adjusted for currency). On a geographic basis, revenue in the growth
markets declined 8.7 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and the major
markets declined 0.9 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). 
 
      
The consolidated gross margin increased 0.9 points versus the first six months
of 2013 to 48.1 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin increased 0.5
points to 48.7 percent compared to the prior year. The improvement in gross
margin in the first six months was driven by margin improvement in GTS and an improved
mix toward Software, partially offset by a margin decline in Systems and
Technology. 
 
      
Total expense and other (income) decreased 4.6 percent in the first six months
of 2014 compared to the prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other
(income) decreased 3.8 percent compared to the first six months of 2013. The
key drivers of the year-to-year change in total expense and other (income) were
approximately:

charges.



 
       There were
two significant items that had an impact on total expense and other (income)
year to year. Workforce rebalancing charges for the first six months of 2014
were $883 million compared to $1,030 million in the prior year. In addition,
the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $219 million in the first half of 2014
related to the divestiture of the customer care outsourcing business.    
       
       Pre-tax income grew 5.2 percent year to year and the
pre-tax margin was 17.4 percent, an increase of 1.4 points year to year. Net income
increased 4.2 percent and the net income margin was 13.9 percent, an increase
of 1.0 points year to year. The effective tax rate for the first six months was
20.0 percent, compared with 19.2 percent in the prior year. Operating
(non-GAAP) pre-tax income increased 0.7 percent year to year and the operating
(non-GAAP) pre-tax margin expanded 0.7 points to 18.6 percent versus the prior
year. Operating (non-GAAP) net income increased 0.4 percent and the operating
(non-GAAP) net income margin of 14.9 percent increased 0.5 points.The operating
(non-GAAP) effective tax rate for the first six months was 20.0 percent versus
19.8 percent in 2013.

(continued)
 

       Diluted earnings per share of $6.37
increased 13.8 percent compared to the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted
earnings per share of $6.82 increased 9.5 percent year to year in the first six
months. In the first six months of 2014, the company repurchased 61.8 million
shares of its common stock.
 
       At June 30, 2014, the
company’s balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong and well
positioned to support the business over the long term. Cash and marketable
securities at quarter end were $9,721 million, a decrease of $1,345 million
from December 31, 2013. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows
are:
 
      
Total assets decreased $1,909 million ($2,470 million adjusted for currency)
from December 31, 2013 driven by:
 
·        
Decreases in total receivables
($2,375 million) and cash and cash equivalents ($1,000 million); partially
offset by
 
·        
Increased prepaid pension assets
($1,343 million). 
 
      
Total liabilities increased $3,507 million ($3,203 million adjusted for
currency) from December 31, 2013 driven by:
 
·        
Increases in total debt ($6,752
million); partially offset by
 
·        
Decreases in taxes payable ($2,298
million) and accounts payable ($1,191 million). 
 
      
Total equity of $17,513 million decreased $5,417 million from December 31, 2013
as a result of:
 
·        
Increased treasury stock ($11,659
million) driven by share repurchases; partially offset by
 
·        
Higher retained earnings ($4,441
million), decreased losses in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
($1,232 million) and higher common stock ($570 million).
 
       The company generated
$6,905 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of
$292 million  compared to the first six months of 2013, driven primarily by a
higher level of cash tax payments ($1,188 million), partially offset by increased
cash provided by receivables ($955 million). Net cash used in investing
activities of $965 million was $911 million lower than the first six months of
2013, primarily due to an increase in cash provided by net sales of marketable
securities and other instruments ($782 million). Net cash used in financing
activities of $6,933 million increased $890 million compared to the prior year,
driven primarily by increased cash used for gross common stock purchases
($5,683 million), partially offset by higher net cash proceeds from total debt
($5,139 million).

  Global Technology Services revenue of $9,414 million
decreased 1.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter
of 2014. Normalizing for the divestiture of the customer care business, revenue
increased 2.0 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency). GTS revenue decreased
2.1 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) to $18,744 million in the first
six months of 2014. However, adjusted for the divestiture, it increased 0.7
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency). Within GTS, the Softlayer platform
contributed about 1 point of constant currency growth in the quarter. The
company is expanding its global cloud footprint, opening a datacenter in Hong
Kong during the second quarter, followed by another in London in July.
Additional capacity will be brought on during the second half of this year. GTS
Outsourcing, one of the company’s core franchises, continued to show
improvement. Normalizing for the customer care divestiture, revenue for the
quarter increased 2.0 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the
prior year and grew on a constant currency basis for the second consecutive
quarter. The revenue growth was driven by the new contracts brought on during
2013. 
Global
Business Services revenue of $4,534 million decreased 1.6 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2014 and decreased 0.8 percent
(flat adjusted for currency) for the first six months of the year. Consulting
and Systems Integration (C&SI) revenue grew 0.6 percent (flat adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter. There was strong double digit growth in the
practices that address the digital front office, particularly in cloud,
analytics and mobile. This was offset by declines in traditional packaged
application implementations. As the Digital Front Office offerings become a
larger part of the portfolio, they will contribute more meaningfully to revenue
performance. In July, the company announced a strategic partnership with Apple
to deliver a new class of “enterprise ready” MobileFirst business applications
for iOS. With this partnership, the company’s consultants and other
client-facing specialists will help expand mobile device productivity, enabling
Big Data and analytics at the point of contact. Consistent with last quarter’s
performance, Application Outsourcing revenue decreased 9.0 percent (9 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter. Performance continues to reflect
pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in
elective projects.

       GTS gross profit margin improved 0.6 points and 0.9
points in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively. In the
second quarter, pre-tax income increased 22.2 percent to $1,850 million and the
pre-tax margin expanded 3.7 points to 19.2 percent compared to the prior year.
The improvement in profit was driven by several factors. First, the company
continues to make investments in key growth areas such as mobile, security and
cloud. These investments result in a differentiated set of capabilities that
complement clients’ system of record and are a good example of how the company
continues to evolve its core franchises. Second, the results reflect a pre-tax
gain of $121 million related to the customer care divestiture, partially offset
by the profit lost from the divested business. Third, the benefit from prior
workforce rebalancing actions, and fourth, the prior year second quarter
results included a workforce rebalancing charge of $352 million. In the first six
months of 2014, pre-tax income increased 3.1 percent to $3,196 million and
pre-tax margin expanded 0.9 points to 16.6 percent compared to the prior year. 
 
        GBS gross profit margin decreased 1.2 points in the
second quarter, but increased 0.1 points for the first six months of 2014
compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income increased 33.7 percent to $832
million and the pre-tax margin expanded 4.8 points to 17.8 percent in the
second quarter. Second quarter profit reflects both the year-to-year benefit
($231 million) in workforce rebalancing charges and the impact of lower revenue
on a relatively fixed cost base. In the first six months of 2014, pre-tax
income increased 10.2 percent to $1,461 million and pre-tax margin expanded 1.7
points to 15.7 percent compared to the prior year.   
  
Global
Services Backlog
 
        The estimated Global Services backlog at June 30, 2014 was $136
billion, a decrease of 3.2 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) compared
to the June 30, 2013 balance.  This includes a backlog reduction in January
2014 of $3.8 billion associated with the customer care divestiture. Adjusting
for the divestiture, backlog was down 0.5 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) year to year. The estimated
transactional backlog at June 30, 2014 increased 3.1 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency) from the June 30, 2013 levels. The estimated outsourcing
backlog decreased 6.3 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) including the
backlog reduction from the customer care divestiture. Adjusting for the divestiture, the estimated
outsourcing backlog decreased 2.1 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to the June 30, 2013 balance.

        Total Global Services
backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing, Consulting and
Systems Integration and Maintenance. Outsourcing backlog includes GTS
Outsourcing and GBS Outsourcing. Transactional backlog includes ITS and
Consulting and Systems Integration. Total backlog is intended to be a statement
of overall work under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations,
adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.
 
Global
Services signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment
under a Global Services contract. There are no third-party standards or
requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by
management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s
commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence
of termination charges or wind-down costs.
 
Signings
include GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems
Integration contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated
as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the company’s requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       Software revenue of
$6,488 million increased 1.0 percent (flat adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and increased 1.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) to $12,149
million in the first six months of 2014, respectively. In the second quarter,
middleware grew 3.4 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) while operating
systems were down 12.5 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency). Across the
software brands, Software-as-a Service (SaaS) offerings are growing rapidly and
in the second quarter increased by approximately 40 percent on a year-to-year
basis.  
 
       Key
branded middleware revenue, which accounted for 67 percent of total Software
revenue in the second quarter of 2014, increased 0.5 percent (flat adjusted for
currency) compared to a strong quarter in the prior year. There was good growth
in several strategic areas – cloud, big data and analytics, mobile and
security. In the first six months of 2014, key branded middleware grew 2.2
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and accounted for 66 percent of total
Software revenue.
 
      
WebSphere revenue increased 5.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and
8.4 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first
six months of 2014 year to year, respectively. The performance in the second
quarter was led by application server, commerce and mobile solutions. Both
on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the
majority of this growth coming from on-premise solutions. The application
server business delivered strong growth, with an increase in demand for
on-premise software that was driven by mobile and analytics workloads. Strong
growth continues in MobileFirst, leveraging over 5,000 mobile experts and the
company’s expanding capabilities. Supporting the partnership with Apple, the Software
Group will develop unique enterprise cloud services native for iOS, to deliver
the full enterprise-class mobile experience from analytics, to cloud storage
and data security.
 
       Information Management revenue decreased 1.1 percent
(2 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and was flat, both as
reported and on a constant currency basis, in the first six months of 2014
compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, relational database
continued to grow, although some product areas in the brand were faced with
tough

comparisons to strong performance in the prior
year.
 
       Tivoli revenue increased 3.6 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and 4.9 percent (4 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2014 compared to the prior
year periods. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by security software,
marking its eleventh consecutive quarter of growth with most of those quarters
increasing by double digits. That includes every quarter since the company
acquired Q1Labs and built a security division around that acquisition,
supplemented by additional analytics capabilities.
  
Workforce Solutions revenue decreased 7.1 percent (8
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and 5.9 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2014 year to year,
respectively. Performance in both periods has been impacted by the transition
from on-premise Notes to SaaS offerings.
  
Rational
revenue decreased 9.3 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) year to year
in the second quarter and decreased 4.8 percent (5 percent adjusted for
currency) in the six months of 2014.
 
Across
software, the company is transitioning its portfolio to capture growth areas
and continues to drive innovation in its core franchises. It is growing and
building capabilities in emerging areas like SaaS, mobile and security and also
in more traditional areas such as application server and relational database,
as new growth areas drive the need for on-premise capabilities. In the second
quarter the Software business faced a tough comparison to strong performance in
the prior year. The company expects year-to-year revenue growth to accelerate
in the second half of the year.

Software gross profit margins of 88.8 percent in the second quarter and 88.2
percent for the first six months of 2014 were essentially flat compared to the
prior year periods. Software pre-tax income of $2,683 million in the second
quarter of 2014 increased 9.8 percent year to year, with a pre-tax margin of
36.5 percent, an improvement of 2.4 points. Second-quarter profit growth
reflects a year-to-year reduction in workforce rebalancing charges of $214
million. Segment pre-tax income for the first six months of 2014 increased 3.2
percent to $4,601 million with a pre-tax margin of 33.0 percent, up 0.2 points.

         Systems and Technology (STG) revenue decreased 11.4 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency) and 16.6 percent (17 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively,
versus the same periods in 2013. The second quarter year-to-year revenue
performance improved compared to the first quarter rate and was driven by
System z mainframe, as well as sequential improvements in System x and Storage.
The improved revenue performance, together with actions taken to align the
structure of the business to the demand profile, resulted in progress in
stabilizing profit. 
 
       System z revenue decreased 0.9 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency) and 16.4 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to the prior year
periods. MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments were flat year to
year in the second quarter of 2014 and down 8 percent in the first six months
of the year. The second quarter results, which included some large deals in the
financial sector in China, the United States and Brazil, reflect significant
performance in the seventh quarter of the product cycle since announcement.
Comparing the current mainframe cycle to date with the prior cycle, the company
has shipped 25 percent more MIPS, and the revenue and gross profit are each
about 98 percent of the previous cycle, net of currency. The System z platform
is one of the company’s core franchises, benefitting from IT trends. The value
proposition for System z becomes stronger as the scale of data and transactions
grow, as well as the need for security of that data and those transactions.
 
      
Power Systems revenue decreased 28.3 percent (29 percent adjusted for currency)
and 25.4 percent (25 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter
and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
This performance reflects fundamental changes in the business and the company
has taken actions to align its structure to the demand profile, while investing
to address opportunities for the future.  In June 2014, entry-level POWER8 was
launched and had a good start compared to previous cycles. The entry-level is
only a small portion of the Power business and, over the remainder of the year,
POWER8 will be introduced into the mid-range and high-end segments.  Also
during the second quarter, the company expanded its OpenPOWER consortium and
doubled the number of alliance members. At the end of June, the company had a
globally diverse membership, with 36 members across ten countries, throughout
the stack from chip designers, to hardware component OEMs, to system vendors
and to middleware and software providers. Within the alliance, members have
access to high end technology, as the Power architecture is available for open
development and to integrate new designs into their hardware platforms.
 
       System x revenue decreased 3.1
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) and 10.4 percent (10 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2014,
respectively, compared to the prior year periods. While second

quarter revenue was down on a year-to-year basis, there
was improvement in the rate compared to the first quarter of 2014 when revenue
was down 18 percent versus the prior year. 
 
       Storage revenue decreased 12.3 percent (13 percent adjusted for
currency) and 17.1 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to the
prior year periods. The second quarter year-to-year rate was a sequential
improvement compared to the 23 percent decrease in the first quarter of this
year. The second quarter included strong growth in Flash Systems, as revenue
doubled over last year, and in the Storwize portfolio which was up double
digits compared to the prior year. However, this growth was more than offset by
weakness in high-end disk and the continued wind-down of the OEM business.
There were a number of product launches in the second quarter including the
V7000 update to the Storwize portfolio and flash-enabled DS8K. 
 
       Microelectronics OEM revenue decreased 17.6 percent (18 percent
adjusted for currency) and 16.8 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) in
the second quarter and first six months of 2014 versus the comparable periods
of 2013, respectively.

       Systems and Technology’s gross
profit margin decreased 2.8 points in the second quarter of 2014 versus the
prior year. The decrease was driven by lower margins in Power Systems (1.1
points), Storage (0.9 points), Microelectronics (0.8 points) and System x (0.8
points), partially offset by an improvement due to revenue mix (0.4 points).
Gross profit margin for the first six months of 2014 decreased 3.7 points
compared to the first six months of 2013. The decrease was driven by lower
margins in Power Systems (1.3 points), Microelectronics (1.0 points) and
Storage (0.9 points), and a decline due to revenue mix (0.7 points). 
 
       Systems and Technology’s pre-tax
income increased $166 million to $25 million in the second quarter and its
pre-tax loss increased $89 million to $635 million for the first six months of
2014 compared to prior year periods. Pre-tax margin increased 4.3 points in the
second quarter and decreased 2.8 points in the first six months versus the
prior year periods. Second-quarter performance reflects a year-to-year
reduction in workforce rebalancing charges of $202 million. 
       The company’s focus for STG in 2014
is to stabilize the profit base and, after the first half of the year, the
company is on track. The company will continue to make investments in this
business to remain a leader in high-performance, high-end systems. In July, the
company announced it will invest $3 billion over the next five years to tackle
the challenges of the “post-silicon” era, demonstrating its commitment to
innovation and to leading in the new era of enterprise IT.

       Total
geographic revenue of $23,931 million decreased 1.9 percent (2 percent adjusted
for currency) in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. In
total, major market countries decreased 0.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency) and growth market countries decreased 6.8 percent (4 percent adjusted
for currency) in the second quarter of 2014. 
 
       In the
growth markets, on a constant currency basis, revenue grew at a double-digit
rate in Latin America, while the Asia Pacific countries declined at a
double-digit rate. China showed significant improvement compared to the last
three quarters, although the balance of the Asia Pacific growth markets remains
challenged. Within the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China,
combined revenue decreased 1.9 percent, but increased 1 percent on a constant
currency basis in the second quarter. This constant currency growth rate
represents a 7 point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. It was
driven by Brazil, India and China, with each country up between 9 and 10 points
quarter to quarter on a constant currency basis. In the second quarter, Brazil
grew 16.9 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency) driven by large deals in
the financial sector.  India decreased 4.1 percent as reported, but grew 3
percent adjusted for currency. China decreased 11.2 percent (11 percent
adjusted for currency) effectively halving the rate of decline from the past
three quarters. Russia declined 12.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency)
on a year-to-year basis. Overall, adjusted for currency, the growth markets had
a modest sequential improvement of 1 point compared to the first quarter of
2014.
 
       Americas
revenue decreased 0.6 percent, but increased 1 percent adjusted for currency
compared to the second quarter of 2013. On a constant currency basis, this
represents a 3 point improvement from the first quarter rate. The improvement
in the Americas was driven by strong System z mainframe performance. Within the
major markets, the U.S. was down 0.8 percent year to year, an improvement of 3
points compared to the first quarter, and Canada was down 9.6 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency). The Latin America growth markets increased 8.0
percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) driven by the strong
performance in Brazil.

       EMEA revenue increased 1.4 percent (decreased 3
percent adjusted for currency) year to year in the second quarter of 2014.
Within the major markets, there was continued growth in Germany and Italy, with
Germany increasing 10.7 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and Italy
increasing 7.0 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the second
quarter of 2013.  However, the UK decreased 6.0 percent (14 percent adjusted
for currency) and France decreased 5.1 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency). The EMEA growth markets decreased 4.7 percent (4 percent adjusted
for currency) driven by declines in the Eastern European countries.
  
       Asia
Pacific second quarter revenue decreased 8.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for
currency) year over year. Japan decreased 1.6 percent as reported, but
increased 2 percent on a constant currency basis. Adjusted for currency, this
was the seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. This constant
currency growth in Japan was more than offset by the Asia Pacific growth market
countries which decreased 12.6 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency) compared
to the second quarter of 2013.
 
       Total geographic
revenue of $46,060 million for the first six months of 2014 decreased 2.8
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Major
markets decreased 0.9 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) and the growth
market countries decreased 8.7 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) for
the first six months of the year.  Within the BRIC countries, combined revenue
was down year to year 6.4 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) driven by
China which decreased 15.0 percent (15 percent adjusted for currency). While
the company had strength in Latin America during the first half of the year,
declines in some of the larger growth markets, such as China, Australia and
Korea, impacted the overall performance in the growth markets.
 
       Americas revenue for
the first six months of 2014 decreased 2.5 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to the prior year. The major market countries were down 3.2
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), partially offset by an increase in
the Latin America growth markets of 2.8 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency). Within the major market countries, the U.S. was down 2.2 percent and
Canada was down 9.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency). Within the Latin
America growth market countries, Brazil increased 8.6 percent (17 percent
adjusted for currency). Mexico decreased 4.5 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
       Europe/Middle
East/Africa (EMEA) revenue increased 2.7 percent (decreased 1 percent adjusted

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 16.1 percent
(16 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2014 versus the second
quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by lower base expense (18
points), partially offset by acquisition-related spending (2 points). Operating
(non-GAAP) SG&A expense decreased 15.7 percent (16 percent adjusted for
currency) primarily driven by lower base expense (17 points), partially offset
by acquisition-related spending (2 points). Base expense includes workforce
rebalancing charges in the second quarter of 2013 of $1,011 million. Normalized
for the workforce rebalancing charges, operating (non-GAAP) SG&A base
expense decreased 2 points year to year compared to the 17 point decrease
above. Bad debt expense increased $43 million year to year driven by specific
provision additions.
 
       SG&A expense decreased 3.0 percent
(2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2014 versus the first
six months of 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by lower base expense (4
points) and the effects of currency (1 point), partially offset by acquisition-related
spending (2 points). Operating (non-GAAP) SG&A expense decreased 2.5
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) primarily driven by lower base
expense (3 points) and the effects of currency (1 point), partially offset by acquisition-related
spending (2 points). Workforce rebalancing charges in the first six months of
2014 were $883 million, a decrease of $147 million year to year, which resulted
in a 1 point year-to-year improvement in the operating (non-GAAP) SG&A base
performance.  Normalized for the workforce rebalancing charges in both
six-month periods, operating (non-GAAP) SG&A base expense decreased 2
points year to year compared to the 3 point decrease above. Bad debt expense
increased $75 million year to year driven by specific provision additions. The

       The increase in interest expense for the second quarter and
first six months of 2014 versus the same periods of 2013 was primarily driven
by higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest
rates. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support
the Global Financing external business. See page 82 for additional information
regarding Global Financing debt and interest expense. Overall interest expense
(excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of
2014 was $259 million and $519 million, respectively, an increase of $11
million and $28 million, respectively, year to year.

       In the second quarter, total retirement-related
plans cost decreased by $238 million compared to the second quarter of 2013,
primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($224 million)
and higher expected return on plan assets ($70 million), partially offset by
higher interest cost ($85 million). Total cost for the first six months of 2014
decreased $451 million versus the first six months of 2013, primarily driven by
a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($462 million) and higher expected
return on plan assets ($116 million), partially offset by higher interest cost
($155 million).

        As discussed in the “Snapshot” on page 46, the
company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others
as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related
costs in the second quarter were $416 million, a decrease of $28 million
compared to the second quarter of 2013, primarily driven by lower defined
contribution plans cost ($22 million). Non-operating costs of $52 million
decreased $210 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year driven
primarily by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($224 million) and higher
expected return on plan assets ($70 million), partially offset by higher
interest cost ($85 million). For the first six months of 2014, operating
retirement-related costs were $834 million, a decrease of $80 million compared
to the first six months of 2013, primarily driven by lower defined contribution
plans cost ($56 million) and lower service cost ($23 million). Non-operating
costs of $175 million decreased $371 million in the first six months of 2014 compared
to the prior year driven primarily by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses
($462 million) and higher expected return on plan assets ($116 million),
partially offset by higher interest cost ($155 million).
       See note 8, "Retirement-Related Benefits,"
for additional plan cost detail.
  
Taxes
 
        The
effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2014 was 20.0 percent compared to
an effective tax rate of 22.1 percent for the second quarter of 2013. The
effective tax rates for the first six months of 2014 and 2013 were 20.0 percent
and 19.2 percent, respectively. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the
second quarter of 2014 was 20.0 percent compared to 22.0 percent for the second
quarter of 2013. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of
2014 was 20.0 percent compared to 19.8 percent for the first six months of
2013.
 
       The decline in the second quarter tax rates compared
to the prior year was primarily due to a more favorable mix of geographic
income and an increase in the expected utilization of foreign tax credits,
offset by the lack of the favorable tax agreement received in the second
quarter of 2013 which required a reassessment of certain valuation allowances
on deferred tax assets (approximately $288 million), partially offset by a tax
charge related to intercompany licensing of certain intellectual property
(approximately $177 million). The year-to-year increase in the tax rates for
the first six months was driven by the aforementioned impacts in the second
quarter and the lack of the first quarter 2013 benefits associated with the
retroactive impact of the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief Act (approximately $135
million) and newly enacted state legislation (approximately $125 million). 
  
       With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing
jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations
for years prior to 2008. The company is no longer subject to income tax
examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2011. The open
years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of
applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing
of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is
always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and
interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for
these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2013 increased $93 million in the second quarter of 2014 and increased $118
million in the first six months of 2014 to $4,576 million. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate was $4,049 million at June 30, 2014.
  
In April 2010, the company appealed the determination of
the Japan Tax Authorities with respect to certain foreign tax losses. The tax
benefit of these losses, approximately $1,183 million, has been included in
unrecognized tax benefits. In April 2011, the company received notification
that the appeal had been denied, and in June 2011, the company filed a lawsuit
challenging this decision. In May 2014, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favor
of the company. The Japanese government has appealed this ruling to the Tokyo
High Court. No final determination has been reached on this matter. 
 
       In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company received
a draft tax assessment notice for approximately $866 million from the Indian
Tax Authorities for 2009. Due to the impact of currency, the assessment is
valued at $890 million at June 30, 2014.  The company believes it will prevail
on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of
liability. At June 30, 2014, the company has recorded $472 million as prepaid
income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash
tax deposits paid over time to protect the company’s right to appeal various
income tax assessments made by the Indian tax authorities.
  
       In the first quarter of 2014, the IRS commenced its
audit of the company’s U.S. tax returns for 2011 and 2012. The company
anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end of 2015.

Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At June 30, 2014, the company continues to have the
financial flexibility to support the business over the long term, as the
company transitions to the new areas of enterprise IT. Cash and marketable
securities at quarter end were $9,721 million. Total debt of $46,470 million
increased $6,752 million from prior year-end levels, driven by an increase in
commercial paper of $4,091 million. The commercial paper balance at June 30,
2014 was $6,549 million, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1 percent.
The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital
preservation and liquidity objectives. In the first six months of 2014, the
company generated $6,905 million in cash from operations, a decrease of $292
million compared to the first six months of 2013. The company has consistently
generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to
additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its $10 billion
global credit facility. 
 
       The assets and debt associated with the Global
Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial
position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are
the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in

       Current assets decreased
$3,168 million (a decrease of $3,417 million adjusted for currency), due to:
 
·        
A decline of $1,759 million

increased $2,278 million ($2,085 million adjusted for currency), as a result
of:
 
·        
An increase in short-term debt of
$5,600 million ($5,581 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by an
increase in commercial paper and by reclasses from long-term debt to reflect
upcoming maturities (see debt analysis on pages 72 and 73); partially offset by
 
·        
A decrease in taxes payable of
$2,298 million ($2,314 million adjusted for currency) due primarily to tax
payments in the U.S and Japan; and

Management Discussion –

       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate
long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset
portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 82.
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
       “Core” debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding
Global Financing debt and equity) was 56.1 percent at June 30, 2014 compared to
39.0 percent at December 31, 2013 and 39.1 percent at June 30, 2013. Given the
expected skew of the company’s cash from operations and free cash flow, the
company expects its “core” debt-to-capitalization ratio to remain in the 50
percent range through the third quarter, and be approximately flat year to year
at the end of 2014.         
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio at June
30, 2014 was 72.6 percent versus 63.4 percent at December 31, 2013 and 65.6
percent at June 30, 2013.   
 
Equity
 
       Total equity decreased by $5,417 million from
December 31, 2013 as a result of an increase in treasury stock of $11,659
million primarily related to gross common stock repurchases in the first six
months of 2014, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $4,441
million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $1,232 million
and an increase in common stock of $570 million.
 
Looking Forward 
 
       The company measures the success of its
business model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The
company’s strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective
of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the
company is well-positioned to take advantage of major shifts occurring in
technology, business and the global economy. 
 
       In May 2010, the company met with
investors to describe how the company manages its business, allocates its
capital and serves its shareholders in a detailed discussion of its strategy.
The company discussed how it continuously changes its business mix and resource
allocation toward higher value, higher growth market opportunities. The company
also discussed its transformation to a globally integrated enterprise and how
this has allowed the company to capture new growth and productivity. The
company highlighted that by aligning its business model with its clients’
needs, the company can achieve its financial goals which will allow the company
to invest in future sources of growth and provide strong returns to its
shareholders. This delivers long-term value and performance to all key
stakeholders. The execution of the company’s strategy results in the 2015 road
map — with the expectation of at least $20 of operating (non-GAAP) earnings per
share in 2015. 
  
       Within the IT industry, there are major
shifts occurring – driven by data, cloud and changes in the way individuals are
engaging. In the first half, the company had good performance in its offerings
that address these shifts, including business analytics, cloud, mobile and
security. As important, the company continues to take significant actions to
move to these growth areas – examples include the targeted investments in
SoftLayer capacity, the Bluemix launch, Watson, POWER8, chip innovation and the
Apple partnership. The company is focused on allocating its capital efficiently
and effectively – which means investing in the right places, as well as moving
away from areas that do not support the company’s shift to higher value. This
is an important part of the company’s model. Over the last few years, including
the pending sale of the industry standard server business, the company has
divested over $6 billion of revenue. The result is a stronger, more relevant
business.
 
       Looking forward in 2014, the company
expects continued good performance in the key growth areas; however, overall
revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in the hardware business and
the customer care divestiture. The customer care divestiture impacted
consolidated revenue growth in the first half by approximately 1 point, and it
is expected that the impact will be approximately 1-1.5 points for the balance
of the year. In addition, the divestiture of the System x server business to
Lenovo will impact revenue performance, although that impact cannot be
determined due to the uncertainty of the timing of the transaction closing. The
company’s gross margin will reflect the ongoing productivity initiatives and
actions to improve the cost base – as well as the relative strength of
software. As always, the company expects to reinvest a portion of the
productivity savings to drive the growth areas. The company also expects to
continue to return value to its shareholders. 

73



Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

In July
2014, the company disclosed that it is expecting GAAP earnings of at least
$17.00 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $18.00 per diluted share
for the full year 2014. The operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share expectation
exclude acquisition-related charges of $0.72 per share and non-operating
retirement-related costs of $0.28 per share. This expectation results in an
increase year to year of 13.8 percent in GAAP earnings per share and an
increase of 10.5 percent year to year in operating (non-GAAP) earnings per
share, keeping the company on track to its 2015 objective. The company’s
guidance for 2014 does not include any gain from the sale of its System x
server business due to the uncertainty of the timing of the transaction and the
amount of the gain. The gain and any other financial statement impacts will
ultimately be reflected in the company’s results, and the company will provide
an update later in the year. For the second half of 2014, the company expects
operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth
quarter versus the third quarter, with an expectation of double-digit earnings
per share growth in the fourth quarter and single-digit earnings per share
growth in the third quarter. Single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per
share growth in the third quarter, due to seasonality, will translate to no
more absolute operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share than what the company
recorded in the second quarter of 2014. The company’s expectations for the
second half of 2014 reflect the same profit mix toward the fourth quarter that
it discussed in April 2014. The fourth quarter is expected to benefit from
strong Software performance, the benefits of productivity which will help margins
in Global Services and transactional benefits in the Systems and Technology
business.      
 
       From a segment perspective, the Software
business delivered increased revenue and profit in the first half, driven by
key branded middleware. The company continues to see very good opportunity for
its software solutions, and expects the revenue growth rate in Software to
accelerate in the second half of 2014 to mid-single digits at constant
currency. The Global Services business delivered constant currency revenue
growth in the first half, adjusting for the divested customer care business.
Pre-tax income increased modestly and the pre-tax margin expanded compared to
the prior year. The company expects Global Services to deliver revenue growth
for the rest of 2014 at rates similar to the first half, and overall, the
company expects Global Services to deliver profit growth in the second half at
a mid-single digit rate compared to the prior year driven by productivity in
the base. Systems and Technology revenue declined 17 percent in the first half
of 2014 reflecting both the cyclical and secular challenges that the company
expects to continue. The company expects continued hardware revenue declines
for the remainder of 2014. The company’s focus for the System and Technology
business in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base on a year to year basis. The
repositioning of the Power platform, the announcement of POWER8, new product
announcements in Storage and the right-sizing of the business will all
contribute to this objective. The company expects these actions, together with
the divestiture of System x, will result in a smaller and more profitable
hardware business going forward. The results in the first half indicate that
the company is on track, and the company still expects profit stabilization on
a full-year basis. The company will remain a leader in high-performance and
high-end systems, in storage and in cognitive computing, and the company will
continue to invest in R&D for advanced semiconductor technology. 
 
       In the growth markets, overall, the
constant currency revenue growth rate improved modestly in the second quarter
compared to the first quarter. Performance in the second quarter was driven by
the sequential improvements in Brazil, India and China. Looking forward, the
company expects sequential improvement in the growth markets and continued
improvement in sequential performance in China. Outside of China, the company
does not expect a material change in the trajectory in the rest of the Asia
Pacific growth markets. Latin America had a strong second quarter driven by
Brazil. The company expects continued good performance in Latin America in the
second half, though it will face a tough compare to a strong second half of
2013. In addition, when the sale of the industry standard server business
closes, that will be a headwind to growth for total company revenue and in the
emerging markets. The company still sees good opportunity in the growth markets
and continues to invest in these key markets to capture that
opportunity.        
      
       The company’s free cash flow performance
in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year was significantly impacted
by cash tax payments. Historically, the company’s free cash flow generation is
skewed to the back end of the year. The company expects free cash flow in 2014
to increase by approximately $1 billion year to year to $16 billion, including
the impacts of cash tax payments. Overall, cash tax payments are expected to be
a year-to-year headwind in 2014 of about $2 billion, with the majority of that
impact having occurred in the first quarter. 
 
       In the first half of 2014, as part of
its common stock repurchase program, the company repurchased 61.8 million
shares of its common stock expending approximately $11.8 billion in the period.
For the full year 2014, the company expects total share repurchase to be about
the same or slightly less than the 2013 amount of $13.9 billion. The company
will continue to return capital to its shareholders for the rest of 2014;
however, it will be at a reduced rate relative to the first half.
 
       The company expects, in the normal
course of business, that its effective tax rate and operating (non-GAAP) tax
rate will be approximately 20 percent in 2014. The rate will change year to
year based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement

of
income tax audits, changes in tax laws and divestitures, as well as recurring
factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, the timing and
amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects
of various global income tax strategies.
 
       The company expects 2014 pre-tax
retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.1 billion, a decrease of
approximately $800 million compared to 2013. This estimate reflects current
pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2013. Within total retirement-related
plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be
approximately $1.7 billion, a decrease of approximately $100 million versus
2013. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be
approximately $350 million, a decrease of approximately $700 million compared
to 2013, driven by less recognized actuarial losses. Cash disbursements for all
retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion in 2014,
an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2013.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At June 30, 2014, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at
year-end 2013. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific
currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears
in the company’s 2013 Annual Report in note D, “Financial Instruments –
Derivative Financial Instruments,” on pages 102 to 106. 


      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this
information does not incorporate any operational actions that management may
take in reaction to fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the
company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first six
months of 2014. Based on the currency rate movements in the first six months of
2014, total revenue decreased 3.1 percent as reported and decreased 2.4 percent
at constant currency versus the first six months of 2013. On a pre-tax income
basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities
resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions)
decrease of approximately $30 million in the first half of 2014. The same
mathematical exercise resulted in a decrease of approximately $170 million in
the first half of 2013. The company views these amounts as a theoretical
maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the
operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the
nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future
currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be
substantially less than the theoretical maximum
given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
 
      
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
      
The company continues to monitor the economic conditions in Venezuela. On
December 30, 2010, the official rate for essential goods was eliminated, with
no change to the SITME rate. In February 2013, the SITME rate was eliminated,
and the official rate was set at 6.3 bolivars fuerte (BsF) to the U.S. dollar. In March 2013, the Venezuelan government created a new
foreign exchange mechanism called the “Complimentary System of Foreign Currency
Acquirement” (or the “SICAD 1”). This system operates similar to an auction
system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be
used for specific import transactions. In December 2013, the Venezuelan
government published the SICAD 1 rate implied by the transactions settled in
these auctions, and issued Exchange Agreement No. 24 which clarified the use of
the SICAD 1 mechanism. In January 2014, the government issued Exchange
Agreement No. 25, and significantly expanded the transactions that qualify for
use of SICAD 1 and stated that a new agency called the National Center of
Foreign Commerce

(CENCOEX) would assume the role of
CADIVI, which historically controlled the sale and purchase of foreign currency
in Venezuela. In February 2014, the Venezuelan government signed into law a
plan to open a new exchange control mechanism (“SICAD 2”), and indicated that
the official rate of 6.3 BsF per USD would increasingly be reserved for the
settlement of USD denominated obligations related to purchases of “essential
goods and services.” In March 2014, the Venezuelan government published
operating rules for SICAD 2 in Exchange Agreement No. 27. SICAD 2 began
operating on March 24, 2014. In March 2014, the company adopted the SICAD 1
rate of 10.7 BsF per USD. The SICAD 1 rate is more
representative of the exchange rate that will be used for the periodic auctions
in SICAD 1 for many of the goods and services sold
by the company’s Venezuelan operations. In the first quarter of 2014, the
company recorded a pre-tax loss of $31 million as a result of the devaluation
in Other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At
June 30, 2014, the company’s net asset position in Venezuela was $38 million. The company’s operations in Venezuela comprised
less than 1 percent of total 2013 and 2012 revenue, respectively.
 
       In
January 2014, the Argentinian government devalued its currency from 6
pesos to the U.S. dollar to 8 pesos to the U.S. dollar. This devaluation did
not have a material impact given the size of the company’s operations in
Argentina (less than 1 percent of total 2013 revenue).
  
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2013 Annual Report, on pages 65 to 67,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 65 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2014, those amounts are $6.9
billion for net cash from operating activities, $9.7 billion of cash and
marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. In 2013, the term of the five-year global credit facility was
extended by one year, and now expires on November 10, 2018. Refer to the 2013
Annual Report on page 114 for additional information. 
 
     
The major rating agencies’ ratings on the company’s debt securities at June 30,
2014 appear in the table below. The agency ratings remain unchanged from
December 31, 2013. The company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in
its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare
an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of
a change in credit rating. The company’s contractual agreements governing
derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the
termination of the agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below
investment grade. At June 30, 2014, the fair value of those instruments that
were in a liability position was $341 million, before any applicable netting,
and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period
based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market
conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the
event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect
on its financial position or liquidity.

      The table appearing on page 66 of the company’s
2013 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash flows
for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of the way
cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. The company prepares its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting
standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and
highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format
on pages 71 and 72. The following is management’s view of cash flows for the
first six months of 2014 and 2013 prepared in a manner consistent with the
table and description on pages 65 and 66 of the company’s 2013 Annual

        Free
cash flow of $3,606 million for the first six months of 2014 decreased $776
million year to year. The decrease was driven primarily by cash tax payments of
$3.5 billion, which were higher year to year $1.2 billion, resulting from audit
settlement payments and other prior period discrete tax impacts that settled in
the first quarter of 2014; excluding the impact of cash tax payments, free cash
flow increased approximately $400 million in the first half of 2014. In the
first six months of 2014, the company continued to focus its cash utilization
on returning value to shareholders including $2.1 billion in dividends and
$11.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases.    
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2013 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe
downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in note 13, “Contingencies,” in this
Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $600 million in 2014. Cash disbursements related to all
retirement-related plans is expected to be approximately $2.8 billion in 2014.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum
contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent
remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.  
 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity
options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional
funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit
facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany
loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.  
 
        The company does earn a significant amount
of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The company’s policy is to indefinitely
reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and
accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a
portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional
U.S tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any,
associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the
company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign
subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for operations and obligations in the
U.S., the company could elect to repatriate these funds which could result in a
reassessment of the company’s policy and increased tax expense.

       The increase in revenue
in the second quarter, as compared to the same period in 2013, was due to:
 
·        
Growth in external revenue of 3.5
percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) due to an increase in financing
revenue (up 5.1 percent to $393 million), partially offset by a decrease in
equipment sales revenue (down 1.7 percent to $111 million); and
 
·        
Growth in internal revenue of 19.2
percent, due to increases in used equipment sales revenue (up 23.0 percent to
$587 million) and in financing revenue (up 0.7 percent to $99 million).
 
       The increase in revenue
in the first six months, as compared to the same period in 2013, was due to:
 
·        
Growth in external revenue of 3.1
percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) due to an increase in financing
revenue (up 4.3 percent to $784 million), partially offset by a decrease in
equipment sales revenue (down 0.8 percent to $231 million); and
 
·        
Growth in internal revenue of 16.7
percent, due to increases in used equipment sales revenue (up 20.2 percent to
$1,094 million) and in financing revenue (up 1.2 percent to $209 million).
 
       The increases in
external financing revenue in the second quarter and for the first six months
of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, were due to an increase in the
average asset balance, partially offset by lower asset yields. The increases in
internal financing revenue in the second quarter and for the first six months
of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, were due to higher asset yields
and average asset balance. 
        
       Global Financing gross
profit increased 14.9 percent and 14.0 percent in the second quarter and for
the first six months, respectively, of 2014, compared to the same periods in
2013, due to an increase in used equipment sales gross profit, partially offset
by a decrease in financing gross profit. The gross profit margin increased 1.7
points and 2.3 points, in the second quarter and for the first six months,
respectively, of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, due to a margin
increase in used equipment sales, partially offset by a margin decrease in financing.
 
       Global Financing
pre-tax income increased 7.7 percent to $593 million in the second quarter, compared
to the same period in 2013, due to higher gross profit ($107 million),
partially offset by increases in financing receivables provisions ($50 million)
and in selling, general and administrative expenses ($14 million). Pre-tax
income increased 9.2 percent to $1,188 million in the first six months of 2014,
compared to the same period in 2013, due to higher gross profit ($201 million),
partially offset by increases in financing receivables provisions ($76 million)
and in selling, general and administrative expenses ($23 million). The
increases in financing receivables provisions for both periods were due to
higher specific reserve requirements in the current year.
 
      The decreases in return
on equity in the second quarter and for the first six months of 2014, compared
to the same periods of 2013, were due to a higher average equity balance,
partially offset by the increase in after-tax income.

table on 
      page 82.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and services, but also
include OEM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients’ total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for systems products, as well as loans
for systems, software and services with terms generally from one to seven
years. Global Financing’s client loans are primarily for software and services
and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the
associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks
in the loan agreements which include covenants to protect against credit
deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client financing also includes
internal activity as described on pages 33 and 34 of the 2013 IBM Annual
Report.
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
        In addition to the actions previously described, in
certain circumstances, the company may take mitigation actions to transfer credit
risk to third parties.
 
       At June 30, 2014,
substantially all financing assets are IT related assets, and approximately 59
percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with
no direct exposure to consumers.

collections of both commercial financing and client financing assets exceeded
new financing originations in the first six months of 2014 which resulted in a
net decline of financing assets from December 31, 2013. New originations of
client financing assets exceeded cash collections in the second quarter of
2014, which resulted in a net increase in client financing assets in this
period. The decrease in originations in the second quarter of 2014 was due to a
decrease in volumes in client financing compared to the second quarter of 2013.
The increase in originations in the first six months of 2014 was due to an
increase in volumes in commercial financing compared to the same period in the
prior year. Internal loan
financing with Global Services is executed under a loan facility and is not
considered originations.
 
      
 Cash generated by Global Financing was
deployed to pay intercompany payables and dividends to IBM as well as business
partners and OEM suppliers.

*   
  Represents reserved receivables, net of recoveries, that were disposed of
  during the period.




** 
  Primarily represents translation adjustments.



 
       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.2 percent at December 31, 2013, to 1.5 percent at
June 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in specific reserve requirements.
Specific reserves increased 32 percent from $279 million at December 31, 2013,
to $367 million at June 30, 2014. Unallocated reserves decreased 5 percent from
$113 million at December 31, 2013, to $107 million at June 30, 2014, due
to the decline in gross financing receivables.   
 
       Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $65 million for the three months ended June
30, 2014, compared to $15 million for the same period in 2013.  Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $98 million for the six months ended June 30,
2014, compared to $22 million for the same period in 2013. The year-to-year
increases in bad debt expense for both periods were due to higher specific
reserve requirements, primarily in China, in the current year.

Management Discussion –

Residual Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment
returned at the end of a lease, represented 58.7 percent and 57.2 percent of
Global Financing's revenue in the second quarter and first six months,
respectively, of 2014, and 55.6 percent and 54.4 percent in the second quarter
and first six months, respectively, of 2013.  The increases in both periods
were due to a higher volume of used equipment sales for internal transactions.
The gross profit margins on these sales were 67.1 percent and 67.5 percent and
59.1 percent and 59.0 percent in the second quarter and in the first six
months, respectively, of 2014 and 2013.  The increases in the gross profit
margin for both periods were driven by a margin increase in internal sales and
a shift in mix toward higher margin internal equipment sales. 

 
       The
table below presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2014 and June
30, 2014. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of
the related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at June 30, 2014 is expected to
be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on
a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of
the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While primarily focused on IBM
products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM products. These
third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided for
by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for the
covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease
payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a
sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate
asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were
$117 million and $96 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively and
$203 million and $226 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of
direct financing leases were $56 million and $59 million for the financing
transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively and $101 million and $115 million for the six months ended June 30,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future values
at the scheduled end of lease were $7 million and $5 million for the
financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively and $12 million and $13 million for the six months ended June 30,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.7 million and $0.5
million for the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $1.2
million and $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

        The company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of
approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed
of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans
are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying
the financing receivable and are based on arm's-length pricing. Both assets and
debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 79.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s
external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing
Results of Operations” on page 78 and in Segment Information on pages 27 and
28.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of Global Services’
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

Looking Forward
 
        Global Financing's
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s
assets and new financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed
to the company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing
assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term commercial
paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A protracted period
where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown
in originations.  
 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As discussed on page 81, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global
Financing has policies in place to manage each of the key risks involved in
financing. These policies, combined with product and client knowledge, should
allow for the prudent management of the business going forward, even during
periods of uncertainty with respect to the global economy.

GAAP
Reconciliation
 
       The tables below provide a reconciliation of the
company’s income statement results as reported under GAAP to its operating
earnings presentation which is a non-GAAP measure. The company’s calculation of
operating earnings, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. Please refer to the “Snapshot” section beginning
on page 46 for the company’s rationale for presenting operating earnings
information.
