Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are
unaudited. In the opinion of the company's management, these statements include
all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to
present a fair statement of the company's results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.
 
      
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake
in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be
different from these estimates. Refer to the company's 2014 Annual Report on
pages 68 to 71 for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
     
 On October 20, 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business and manufacturing
operations to GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The assets and liabilities of the
Microelectronics business are reported as held for sale at June 30, 2015. The
operating results of the Microelectronics business have been reported as
discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to
this presentation to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing
operations. Refer to Note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional
information on the transaction. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, the
company renamed its Systems & Technology segment to Systems Hardware and
its System z brand to z Systems.
 
      
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full
year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the company's 2014 Annual Report.
 
     
 Noncontrolling interest amounts in income of $2.4 million and $2.4 million, net of tax, for
the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $3.5 million and $1.9 million, net of tax, for
the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are included in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense line
item.
 
      
Within the financial statements and
tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of
rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated
where applicable.
  

 
2. Accounting Changes:  In May 2015, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which removed the requirement to categorize
within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is
measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The
amendments also removed the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments
that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per
share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments
for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical
expedient. The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption
permitted. The guidance is a change in disclosure only and will not have a
material impact in the consolidated financial results.
 
     In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which
requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is
effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is a
change in financial statement presentation only and will not have a material
impact in the consolidated financial results. At June 30, 2015, the company had
approximately $77 million in debt issuance
costs included in investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position.
     In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software
license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other
software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software
license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a services
contract. All software licenses recognized under this guidance will be
accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early
adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material
impact in the consolidated financial results.    
     In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the
recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue recognition will
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to 

9



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance
also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance
permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the guidance recognized at the date of initial application. The guidance was
initially effective January 1, 2017 and early adoption was not permitted. In
July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date to
January 1, 2018, with an option of applying the standard on the original
effective date. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
guidance, the effective date and the method of adoption.
       In April 2014, the FASB
issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting a discontinued
operation. Only disposals of a component that represents a strategic shift that
has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results
is a discontinued operation. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures
about discontinued operations and disposals of a significant part of an entity
that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2015. The impact to the company will be dependent on any
transaction that is within the scope of the new guidance.
       In July 2013, the FASB
issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when
a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward exists. Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits
should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred
tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax
credit carryforward. The guidance was effective January 1, 2014. The
guidance was a change in financial statement presentation only and did not have
a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 
  In March 2013, the FASB issued
guidance on when foreign currency translation adjustments should be released to
net income. When a parent entity ceases to have a controlling financial
interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign
entity, the parent is required to release any related cumulative translation
adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment
should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the
complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which
the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The guidance was effective January 1,
2014 and did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.  
     In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of
the guidance is fixed at the reporting date. Examples include debt arrangements,
other contractual obligations and settled litigation matters. The guidance
requires an entity to measure such obligations as the sum of the amount that
the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its
co-obligors plus additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay on
behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance was effective January 1, 2014 and did
not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.
 
3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 

10



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

      
The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest
rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For
derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow
analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 
       Certain financial assets
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity
method investments that are recognized at fair value at the measurement date to
the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale
equity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In
the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a financial investment, fair
value is measured using a model described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. In the third quarter of 2014, the company recorded an
impairment on certain assets that were initially reported as held for sale at
September 30, 2014. See note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional
information. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 
       Accounting guidance permits the
measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other
accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied
the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2015 and December 31,
2014.

million.
 
       There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the company transferred
trading security investments valued at $74 million from Level 2 to Level 1 due
to the expiration of certain regulatory restrictions.
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
 
Notes and other accounts receivable and
other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate
fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt
(excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities
with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in
the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.    
 
Loans and Long-term
Receivables
 
       Fair values are based on discounted future cash
flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with
similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the difference
between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term
receivables was immaterial. If
measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments
would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
 


13



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

Long-Term Debt
 
       Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is
based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an
asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market
price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates
currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $33,339 million and $35,073 million, and the estimated
fair value was $35,188 million and $37,524 million at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively. If
measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including
the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities are
considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

       During the
fourth quarter of 2014, the company acquired equity securities in conjunction
with the sale of the industry standard server business which are classified as
available-for-sale securities. Gross unrealized losses of $14 million and gross
unrealized gains of $13 million related to
available-for-sale securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
 
       Based on an evaluation of available evidence as of June 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, the company believes that unrealized losses on debt
and available-for-sale equity investments were temporary and did not represent
a need for an other-than-temporary impairment.     
 
       Sales of debt and available-for-sale equity investments
during the period were as follows:

     The contractual
maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less
than one year at June 30, 2015.
 
Derivative
Financial Instruments 
 
       The company operates in multiple
functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global
markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact
of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser
extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company
limits these risks by following established risk management policies and
procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective,
financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For
interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements
between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease and other
financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt.
Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these
collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014 was $18 million and $21 million, respectively, for which
no collateral was posted at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Full collateralization of these
agreements would be required in the event that the company’s credit rating
falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250
basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security
arrangements. The
aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions as of June
30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $1,205 million and $1,432 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This
exposure was reduced by $152 million and $97 million at June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting
arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, this exposure was reduced by $219 million and $487 million
of cash collateral, respectively, received by the company. At June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $816 million and $817
million, respectively.  At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net
exposure related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position was $60 million and $99 million, respectively. 

 
       In the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against
liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or
payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral 

15



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

against the fair values of the related derivative
instruments. No amount
was recognized in other receivables at June 30, 2015 or December 31, 2014 for
the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable
for the obligation to return cash collateral was $219 million and $487 million
at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash collateral
received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and
other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was
rehypothecated at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The company held $17 million
and $31 million in non-cash collateral in U.S. Treasury securities at June 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  
 
       The company may employ derivative
instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders’ equity resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the
company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net
investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have
an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow
from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this
cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these
hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative
instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in
the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation
until maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts,
interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the
underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative
instruments.
 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk,
follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The company issues debt in the global
capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan portfolios.
Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with
the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall
interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges).
At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of the
company’s interest rate swaps was $6.4 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.
The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014 was approximately 7.8 years and 8.7 years, respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The company is exposed to interest
rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may
use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest
payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges.
The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program
outstanding at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       At June
30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, net gains of approximately $1 million (before
taxes) were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in
connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings. Within these
amounts, gains of less than $1 million are expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying transactions.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large portion of the company’s
foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net
investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’
equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional
currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The
company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts
for this risk management purpose. At June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments
designated as net investment hedges was $4.4 billion and $2.2 billion,
respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at
June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was approximately 0.2 years for both periods.
 
 

16



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The company’s operations generate
significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company’s
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these
foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency
markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to
manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as
cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $7.8 billion
and $9.3 billion, respectively.  The weighted-average remaining maturity of
these instruments at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was 0.6 years and 0.7
years, respectively.
 
       At June
30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in connection with cash flow hedges of
anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of
$463 million and net gains of $602 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $425
million of gains and $572 million of gains, respectively, are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 
 
Foreign
Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
       The company is exposed to exchange
rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the
company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency
denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of
the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows is approximately seven years. At June 30, 2015 and December
31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under this program.
 
       At June
30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign
currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $2 million
(before taxes) in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these
amounts, less than $1 million of losses are expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying exposure.      
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The company uses its Global Treasury
Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use
currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition,
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a
net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s
nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and
swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values
of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally
offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.
At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $14.2 billion
and $13.1 billion, respectively. 
 
Equity Risk
Management
 
       The company is exposed to market price
changes in certain broad market indices and in the company’s own stock
primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives,
including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related
to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the
total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the
company’s common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses
also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.2 billion and $1.3
billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
       The company may hold warrants to
purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are
deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement
provisions. The company records the changes in the 

17



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

fair
value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.
The company did not have any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at
June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       The company is exposed to a potential
loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company
may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures.
The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other
(income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have
any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       The company is exposed to market
volatility on certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or
forwards to economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of investment securities was less than $0.1 billion for both
periods.
 
       The

Net investment in sales-type and
direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$674 million and $671 million at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of
$517 million and $517 million, and net of the
allowance for credit losses of $210 million and $165 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses of $16 million and $17 million at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan receivables and installment payment receivables (loans), net of the
allowance for credit losses of $423 million and $396 million at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to
clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment
terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) financing contracts are
priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $524 million and $642 million at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing
receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at June 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014. The company determines its allowance
for credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan
receivables, and further segments the portfolio into two classes: major markets
and growth markets.

       When determining the allowances,
financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective
basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the
expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential
loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is
probable, the company records a specific reserve. In addition, the company
records an unallocated reserve that is determined by applying a reserve rate to
its different portfolios, excluding accounts that have been specifically
reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.  
 
Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
        The following table presents the recorded investment in financing
receivables which were on non-accrual status at June 30, 2015 and December 31,
2014.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit
quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available
information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically
based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical
rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service credit ratings as shown
below. The company uses information provided by Moody’s, where available, as one
of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings.
 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
Receivables with a credit quality
indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others
are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not
reflect mitigation actions that the company may take to transfer credit risk to
third parties.

* Reflects the one-time effects related to the divestiture
  of the customer care business and industry standard server businesses in 2014
  and 2015, respectively. 



 
        Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost
for the three months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $11 million compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related to
performance share units ($7 million) and decreases in the company’s assumption
of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($5 million),
offset by an increase related to restricted stock units ($1 million). Pre-tax
stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased
$8 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This was due
to decreases related to performance share units ($6 million) and decreases
related to the company’s assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by
acquired entities ($7 million), offset by an increase related to restricted
stock units ($5 million).
 
       The amount of
stock-based compensation cost included in the loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was immaterial in all periods.
 
       As of June 30,
2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,111 million related to
non-vested awards was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.7 years.
 
       There was no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at June 30, 2015 and
2014.
 
6. Segments:  
The tables on pages 28 and 29 reflect the results of continuing operations of
the company’s segments consistent with the management and measurement system
utilized within the company. Performance
measurement is based on pre-tax income from continuing operations. These
results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker, both in
evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the
segments.
 
       In January 2015, the company’s
business process outsourcing business, Global Process Services, which was
previously managed within Global Technology Services, was integrated into
Global Business Services, creating an end-to-end business transformation
capability for clients and to better leverage the company’s industry knowledge.
The following tables reflect this reclassification for the prior-year periods.

       In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Spain issued a ruling in
litigation involving IBM Spain’s defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution
(DC) plans. As a result of this ruling, the company recorded a pre-tax
retirement-related obligation of $148 million in 2014 ($55 million in the first
quarter and $93 million in the second half)
in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. The Constitutional Court denied IBM Spain’s requested
leave to appeal the decision. In March 2015, the National Audience Court issued
a ruling that, in part, required IBM to stop making DC contributions and also
ruled that the company should promptly reinstate the DB plan. As a result of this
ruling, in the first quarter of 2015, the company recorded an additional
pre-tax retirement-related obligation of $230 million in SG&A in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This obligation is reflected in
"Non-U.S. Plans - Multi-employer plans/other costs" in the six months
ended June 30, 2015 table above. IBM Spain appealed that ruling and in May
2015, the National Audience Court dismissed the appeal. See note 12,
"Contingencies" for additional information.
 
       In 2015, the company expects to contribute to its
non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans approximately $600 million, which will be
mainly contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in the UK, Japan, the
Netherlands and Spain. This amount represents the legally mandated minimum
contribution. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six
months of 2015 were $186 million.

9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
 
Acquisitions: During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the company
completed five acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $660 million.   
The Software segment completed acquisitions of four
privately held businesses: in the first quarter, AlchemyAPI, Inc. (AlchemyAPI)
and Blekko, Inc. (Blekko); and in the second quarter, Explorys, Inc. (Explorys)
and Phytel, Inc. (Phytel). Global Technology Services (GTS) completed one
acquisition: in the second quarter, Blue Box Group, Inc. (Blue Box), a
privately held company. 
       Each
acquisition is expected to enhance the company’s portfolio of product and
services capabilities. AlchemyAPI is a leading provider of scalable cognitive
computing application program interface services and computing applications.
Blekko technology provides advanced Web-crawling, categorization and
intelligent filtering. Explorys provides secure cloud-based solutions for
clinical integration, at-risk population management, cost of care measurement
and pay-for-performance. Phytel is a leading provider of SaaS-based population
health management offerings that help providers identify patients at risk for
care gaps and to engage the patient to begin appropriate preventative care.
Blue Box provides hosted, managed, OpenStack-based production-grade private clouds
for the enterprise and service provider markets. Purchase price consideration
for these acquisitions as reflected in the following table, was paid primarily
in cash. All acquisitions are
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and
cash equivalent.
 
       The following table reflects the purchase price
related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price allocations as
of June 30, 2015.

        The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity was recorded at
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired businesses
and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify as an
amortizable intangible asset. The
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 6.5 years. These
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives.
Goodwill of $465 million was assigned to the Software segment and goodwill of
$62 million was assigned to the Global Technology Services segment. It is
expected that 1 percent of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. 
 
       On July
23, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of Compose, Inc., a privately
held company that provides auto-scaling, production-ready databases that help
developers deploy data services quickly and easily. At the date of issuance of
the financial statements, the initial purchase accounting was not complete for
this acquisition.
        
Divestitures: 
 
        Microelectronics – On October 20,
2014, IBM and GLOBALFOUNDRIES announced a definitive agreement in which
GLOBALFOUNDRIES would acquire the company’s Microelectronics business,
including existing semiconductor manufacturing assets and operations in East
Fishkill, NY and Essex Junction, VT. The commercial OEM business to be acquired
by GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes custom logic and specialty foundry, manufacturing
and related operations. The transaction closed on July 1, 2015.
 
       The transaction includes a 10-year
exclusive manufacturing sourcing agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES will
provide server processor semiconductor technology for use in IBM Systems. The
agreement provides the company with capacity and market-based pricing for
current semiconductor nodes in production and progression to nodes in the
future for both development and production needs. As part of the transaction,
the company will provide GLOBALFOUNDRIES with certain transition services,
including IT, supply chain, packaging and test services and lab services. The
initial term for these transition services is one to three years, with
GLOBALFOUNDRIES having the ability to renew. 
 
       In the third quarter of 2014, the
company recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.7 billion related to the sale of the
Microelectronics disposal group, which was part of the Systems Hardware reportable segment. The
pre-tax charge reflected the fair value less the estimated cost of selling the
disposal group including an impairment to the semiconductor long-lived assets
of $2.4 billion, $1.5 billion representing the cash consideration expected to
be transferred to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and $0.8 billion of other related costs. The
asset impairment was reflected in property, plant and equipment, net and the
other costs of disposal were reflected in other accrued expenses and
liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position at June 30, 2015. Additional pre-tax charges of $51 million were
recorded in the first half of 2015 related to the disposal. The cumulative
pre-tax charge was $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2015. Additional charges may be
recorded in future periods. 
 
       All assets and liabilities of the
business are reported as held for sale at June 30, 2015. The cash consideration
is expected to be transferred over three years. On the closing date, the
company transferred $472 million of net cash to 

37



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

GLOBALFOUNDRIES.
This amount included $750 million of cash consideration, adjusted by the amount
of working capital due from GLOBALFOUNDRIES and other miscellaneous items.
       Reporting the related assets and
liabilities initially as held for sale at September 30, 2014 was based on
meeting all of the criteria for such reporting in the applicable accounting
guidance. While the company met certain criteria for held for sale reporting in
prior periods, it did not meet all of the criteria until September 30, 2014. In
addition, at September 30, 2014, the company concluded that the
Microelectronics business met the criteria for discontinued operations
reporting. The disposal group constitutes a component under accounting
guidance. The continuing cash inflows and outflows with the discontinued component
are related to the manufacturing sourcing arrangement and the transition,
packaging and test services. These cash flows are not direct cash flows as they
are not significant and the company will have no significant continuing
involvement. 
 
Summarized financial information for
discontinued operations is shown in the tables below.

Industry Standard
Server – On January 23,
2014, IBM and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) announced a definitive
agreement in which Lenovo would acquire the company’s industry standard server
portfolio (System x) for an adjusted purchase price of $2.1 billion, consisting
of approximately $1.8 billion in cash, with the balance in Lenovo common stock.
The stock represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in Lenovo. The
company would sell to Lenovo its System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade
servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and
iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and maintenance
operations.
 
IBM and Lenovo entered into a strategic
relationship which included a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales of
IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems, tape
storage systems, General Parallel File System software, SmartCloud Entry
offering, and elements of IBM’s system software, including Systems Director and
Platform Computing solutions. Effective with the initial closing of the
transaction, Lenovo assumed related customer service and maintenance
operations. IBM will continue to
provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s behalf for an extended period of time.
In addition, as part of the transaction agreement, the company will provide
Lenovo with certain transition services, including IT and supply chain
services. The initial term for these transition services ranges from less than
one year to three years. Lenovo can renew certain services for an additional
year.
 
The initial closing was completed on
October 1, 2014. A subsequent closing occurred in most other countries in which
there was a large business footprint on December 31, 2014. The remaining countries closed on March 31,
2015 resulting in a

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

pre-tax gain of $16 million in the
first quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2015, an additional pre-tax
gain of $36 million was recorded attributed to certain adjustments resolved
during the quarter.
 
Overall, the company continues to expect to
recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.5 billion, which does not include associated costs related to
transition and performance-based costs. Net of these charges, the pre-tax gain
is approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.1 billion was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2014. The balance of the gain is
expected to be recognized in 2019 upon conclusion of the maintenance agreement.  
 
Customer Care – On
September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a definitive agreement in which SYNNEX
would acquire the company’s worldwide customer care business process
outsourcing services business for $501 million, consisting of approximately
$430 million in cash, net of balance sheet adjustments, and $71 million in
SYNNEX common stock, which represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in
SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered into a multi-year agreement
with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s outsourcing business, became an IBM
strategic business partner for global customer care business process
outsourcing services. 
 
The initial closing was completed on January 31, 2014, with
subsequent closings occurring in 2014. In the
fourth quarter of 2014, the company continued to work toward resolution of the
required final balance sheet adjustments. A pre-tax charge in the amount of $10
million was recorded to reflect the expected resolution. For the full year of
2014, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million related to this transaction.

 
        In  the second quarter of 2015, resolution of the final balance
sheet adjustments was concluded.  As a result, the company made a payment of
$43 million to SYNNEX. Additionally, SYNNEX remitted to the company $40 million
to settle the remaining consideration due related to this transaction.  Through
June 30, 2015, the cumulative pre-tax gain attributed to this transaction is
$208 million. 
 
Retail Store Solutions – On April 17, 2012, the company announced
that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba TEC for the sale of its
Retail Store Solutions business. As part of the transaction, the company agreed
to transfer the maintenance business to Toshiba TEC within three years of the
original closing of the transaction.
 
In  second quarter of 2015, the company completed
the final phase of the transfer of the maintenance workforce to Toshiba. The
parts and inventory transfer to Toshiba will commence in the third quarter of
2015 and is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2015. The
workforce transfer and an assessment of the ongoing contractual terms of the
transaction resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $1 million in the
second quarter of 2015.
 
        Overall, the company has recognized a
cumulative total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $511 million. 
  Others ‒ In the second quarter of 2015, the company completed the
divestiture of its Travel & Transportation kiosk business to Embross North
America Ltd., and the divestiture of its Telecom Expense Management product to
Tangoe, Inc.  
 
       In the first quarter of 2015, the company
completed the divestiture of the Algorithmics Collateral Management suite of
products to SmartStream, Inc. and the divestiture of the Commerce ILOG Supply
Chain Optimization Tools suite of products to Llamasoft, Inc. 
 
The financial terms of each transaction
were not material.

* Other intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and

     The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$165 million during the first
six months of 2015, primarily due to amortization, partially offset by
intangible asset additions resulting from capitalized software and
acquisitions. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $296 million and $594 million
for the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively, versus $340 million and $679 million
for the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively. In addition,
in the first six months of 2015, the company retired $608 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.  
 
     The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following

*      The portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt obligations
that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
as an amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying value plus a fair value
adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt
obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates.
 
       The company’s indenture governing its debt
securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants
which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the
aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10 percent of the company’s
consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge
or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also
include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio,
which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 
       The company is in compliance with all of its
significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders.
The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of
default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain
events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to
which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.  
        Pre-swap annual contractual maturities of
long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2015, are as follows:

12.  Contingencies:   As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries,
IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a
leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will
continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated
products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement
and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company
enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations,
lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and
scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions
involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters
related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may
involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel
questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters
arise.
 
       The company records a provision with
respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Any
recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter
ended June 30, 2015 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
      
In accordance with the relevant
accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the
likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the
company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and
qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the
industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.
 
      
With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any
material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court
rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With
respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed in this Note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is
unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses,
including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following
reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters. It is the company’s experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation
against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are
not meaningful indicators of the company’s potential liability. Further, the
company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors
with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including
considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence
of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and
development of information important to the matters. The company reviews
claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions
are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing
reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate),
to reflect the impact 

43



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

and status of settlement
discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel
and other information pertinent to a particular matter.
 
       Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined
in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a
material effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the
timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such
remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies
may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and
circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional
factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is
possible that the company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution
of one or more of these matters.
 
       The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.
 
      
The company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux
and the company has asserted counterclaims. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff
filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed.
The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in
March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare
copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize
Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX
license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In
June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v.
IBM case, and proceedings have resumed in that case.      
 
 
On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on
behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one another
in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social service
program processing in Indiana. The State terminated the contract, claiming that
IBM was in breach, and the State is seeking damages. IBM believes the State’s
claims against it are without merit and is seeking payment of termination
amounts specified in the contract. After six weeks of trial, on July 18, 2012,
the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the State’s claims in
their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed
portions of the trial judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and
ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to determine the State's damages,
if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of
the trial court's award of damages to IBM. This matter remains pending in the
Indiana courts.
 
      
 On April 16, 2014, Iusacell SA de C.V.
(Iusacell) sued IBM, claiming that IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations that
induced Iusacell to enter into an agreement with IBM Mexico. Iusacell claims
damages for lost profits. Iusacell’s complaint relates to a contractual dispute
in Mexico, which is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico
initiated by IBM Mexico against Iusacell for breach of the underlying
agreement.   On November 14, 2014, the District Court in the Southern
District of New York granted IBM's motion to stay Iusacell's action against the
company pending the arbitration in Mexico between Iusacell and IBM Mexico.
 
      
IBM United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal proceedings in May 2010
before the High Court in London against the IBM UK Pensions Trust (the UK
Trust) and two representative beneficiaries of the UK Trust membership. IBM UK
is seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully both in notifying the Trustee
of the UK Trust that it was closing its UK defined benefit plans to future
accruals for most participants and in implementing the company’s new retirement
policy. In April 2014, the High Court acknowledged that the changes made to its
UK defined benefit plans were within IBM’s discretion, but ruled that IBM
breached its implied duty of good faith both in implementing these changes and
in the manner in which it consulted with employees. Proceedings to determine
remedies were held in July 2014, and in February 2015 the High Court held that
for IBM to make changes to accruals under the plan would require a new
consultation of the participants, but other changes (including to early
retirement policy) would not require such consultation. IBM UK has appealed
both the breach and remedies judgments and a decision is not expected until at
least 2016. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the
Court’s rulings would require IBM to reverse the changes made to the UK defined
benefit plans retroactive to their effective dates. This could result in an
estimated non-operating one-time pre-tax charge of approximately $250 million,
plus ongoing defined benefit related accruals.  In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290
individual actions brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined
benefits plans who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive
dismissal and age discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in
Southampton UK.

       On March 24, 2014, in a suit brought by local Works Councils, the
Supreme Court of Spain held that IBM Spain’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan
implemented in 1993 based on the voluntary participation of its employees was
null and void. The Supreme Court also held that current employees could
reinstate their rights to a Defined Benefit (DB) Plan, although with an offset
for DC contributions paid to date. The Court held that IBM Spain did not
consult with the Works Councils in seeking to change the pension scheme, and
recommended that IBM Spain and the Works Councils engage in discussions over
how to carry out the offset. The Constitutional Court denied IBM Spain’s
requested leave to appeal the decision. In March 2015, the National Audience
Court ruled that the Works Council was not entitled to dictate the means by
which IBM should carry out the offset of DC contributions, but also ruled that
the Supreme Court's judgment could be executed without the need for individual
lawsuits by employees, rejecting the position that the judgment was declaratory
only. The National Audience Court also ruled that IBM should stop making DC
contributions, and that the company should promptly reinstate the DB Plan. IBM Spain appealed that ruling and in May 2015, the National Audience Court
dismissed the appeal.  IBM continues to reexamine its business model as it reinstitutes an
outdated pension plan that employees elected to forego 20 years ago, which
benefits a limited subset of the overall population of employees in Spain. The
Works Councils continue to challenge IBM’s implementation approach.     
 
       In March 2011, the company announced that it had
agreed to settle a civil enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) relating to alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (FCPA). On July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011 settlement and
required that for a two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC and the court
on certain matters, including those relating to compliance with the FCPA. In
early 2012, IBM notified the SEC of an investigation by the Polish Central
Anti-Corruption Bureau involving allegations of illegal activity by a former
IBM Poland employee in connection with sales to the Polish government. IBM is
cooperating with the SEC and Polish authorities in this matter. In April 2013,
IBM learned that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating allegations related to the Poland matter, as well as
allegations relating to transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The
DOJ is also seeking information regarding the company's global FCPA compliance
program and its public sector business. The company is cooperating with the DOJ
in this matter.
 
In March 2015, putative class action litigation
was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York related to the company's October 2014 announcement that it was
divesting its global commercial semiconductor technology business. The company
and three of its officers are named as defendants. Plaintiffs allege that
defendants violated Sections 20(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In May 2015, a
related putative class action was also commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York based on the same underlying facts,
alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The
company, management’s Retirement Plans Committee, and three current or former
IBM executives are named as defendants.
 
       The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the
Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and
claim damages in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and
property damages allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater
contamination and vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain
structures in which plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business,
allegedly resulting from the release of chemicals into the environment by the
company at its former manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These
complaints also seek punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The
company has reached an agreement in principle to settle substantially all of these
cases.
 
      
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
       The company is also
subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various
jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil,
the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding
non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total
potential amount related to these matters for all applicable years is
approximately $560 million. The company believes it will prevail on these
matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.
 
13. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $5,706 million and $5,365 million at June 30, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available
to the 

45



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

company’s business partners to support their
working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future
financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for
approximately $1,773 million and $1,816 million at June 30, 2015 and December
31, 2014, respectively.
 
       The company has applied the guidance
requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the
likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The following is a
description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the
assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically indemnification
provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the company’s payment, the
company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time
and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse
against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $37 million and $46 million at June 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.

contracts are presented in the following tables.

Organization of Information:
 
       In October 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business. The assets and
liabilities of the Microelectronics business are reported as held for sale at
December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. The operating results of the
Microelectronics business are reported as discontinued operations. Prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion, where applicable,
to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations. The transaction
closed on July 1, 2015. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, the company
renamed its Systems & Technology segment to Systems Hardware and its System
z brand to z Systems. 
 
Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on pages 76 and 77 for additional information.
  

 
Divestitures:
 
       In 2014
and 2015, the company completed the divestitures of its customer care process
outsourcing business to SYNNEX and its industry standard server business
(System x) to Lenovo. For the customer care transaction, the initial closing
date was January 31, 2014. For the System x transaction, the initial closing
date was October 31, 2014. The company presents certain financial results in
the Management Discussion excluding the effects of the customer care and/or the
System x business divestitures. The company believes that presenting financial
information without either or both of these items is 

47



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

more
representative of operational performance and provides insights into, and
clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be
more useful to users of the financial statements. 
 
Operating
(non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
        In an effort to provide better transparency into the
operational results of the business, the company separates business results
into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing
operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain
acquisition-related charges, retirement-related costs, discontinued operations
and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings exclude the
amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable
restructuring and related expenses and tax charges related to acquisition
integration. For retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain
items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes defined
benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost,
amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans
in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost includes defined
benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected
return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any
plan curtailments/settlements and multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency
costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily
related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to
financial market performance and the company considers these costs to be
outside the operational performance of the business.
 
       Overall, the company believes that providing
investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides
increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the
business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves
visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational
performance; enables better comparisons to peer companies; and allows the
company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The
company’s reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from
continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement
system.
 
      
 The following table provides the company’s (non-GAAP)
operating earnings for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014.

Financial
Performance Summary:
 
       In the
second quarter of 2015, the company delivered $20.8 billion in revenue, $3.5
billion in income from continuing operations and $3.8 billion in operating
(non-GAAP) earnings resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $3.58 as reported and $3.84 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The
results of continuing operations exclude a net loss from discontinued
operations of $0.1 billion in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 related
to the divestiture of the Microelectronics business. On a consolidated basis,
net income in the second quarter of 2015 was $3.4 billion, with diluted
earnings per share of $3.50. The company generated $3.9 billion in cash from
operations and $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter enabling
shareholder returns of $2.4 billion in gross common stock repurchases and
dividends.
 
  Total consolidated revenue decreased
13.5 percent as reported, but less than 1 percent year to year adjusted for
divestitures and currency in the second quarter of 2015. The company’s revenue
performance included the impact of currency (9 points or $2.1 billion) and
divested businesses (4 points). Combined, these impacts reduced the reported
revenue growth by 13 points. 
 
       Revenue in the strategic imperatives‒those
that address the market trends in data, cloud and engagement‒grew year to
year more than 20 percent as reported and more than 30 percent adjusted for
currency and divestitures in the second quarter. 

48



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

The
company is able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because
of the industry perspective and deep insight it has from working with its
clients on their core businesses and helping them move to these strategic
areas. Business analytics revenue increased 12 percent as reported and more
than 20 percent adjusted for currency, which was well above market rates. This
growth is on a large revenue base ($17 billion in 2014) and was led by Global
Business Services and Systems Hardware, reflecting high-end systems that
specifically address analytics workloads. The company is also developing new
markets in this business with the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson.
Cloud revenue was up over 50 percent as reported and over 70 percent year to
year adjusted for currency and divestitures in the second quarter. For the 12
months ending June 30, 2015, cloud revenue was $8.7 billion, adjusted for
divestitures. The company had strong performance in both its private
foundations revenue and its as-a-Service offerings and exited the quarter with
an annual as-a-Service run rate of $4.5 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the
second quarter of 2014. The cloud business is substantial and growing rapidly.
The market continues to evolve beyond pure infrastructure toward higher value
process-, data- and analytics-as-a-Service engagements‒in the same way
the Internet evolved from browsing to a full transactional business platform.
Clients are finding value in the combination of public, private and hybrid
implementations that the company is able to provide. Security revenue increased
7 percent as reported and over 10 percent adjusted for currency, and mobile
revenue quadrupled on both an as reported and constant currency basis. Social
revenue was up more than 30 percent as reported and more than 40 percent
adjusted for currency.    
 
  From a segment perspective, the
company saw an increase in demand in the Global Services business with 22
signings over $100 million in the second quarter, the highest number in over
two years. This contributed to a services backlog at June 30, 2015 of $122
billion at constant currency, which is up year to year for the first time since
the end of 2013. In the Systems Hardware business, the company has been
delivering innovation and repositioning the portfolio. In the second quarter,
the Systems Hardware business had solid revenue and profit performance. The z
Systems revenue increased 9.2 percent as reported and 15 percent at constant
currency, with z13 mainframe performance in line with previous cycles. Power
Systems revenue grew again in the second quarter, at constant currency, led by
growth in scale-out systems which are capturing both the UNIX and Linux
opportunity, and in the high end which returned to growth. 
 
There are parts of the business that
impacted second-quarter performance, whose transformation efforts will yield
benefits over the longer term. In this quarter, certain parts of the Global
Services business did not deliver sufficient productivity in the base to fund
the investments being made and to offset the impact of currency. While the
investments are expected to yield returns over time, they are impacting profit
growth in the near term. The Services businesses are making the shift in their
offerings as evidenced by the signings and backlog growth, but are also focused
on driving additional productivity to improve the profit profile.     
 
       The company has taken several actions since the
beginning of the second quarter to continue its shift to higher value,
including:
      
·       Completed the divestiture of the semiconductor
manufacturing business to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, 
·        Announced that an IBM Research-alliance produced the
industry’s first 7-nanometer chip, 
·        Launched Watson Health, acquired Phytel and Explorys, and
partnered with other leading healthcare companies, 
·        Made other significant investments in the strategic
imperatives, including; continuing to build out cloud data centers and launched
important new partnerships in analytics, mobile, social and cloud, 
·       Announced that Spark would be embedded into the company’s
analytics and commerce platforms, and 
·       Formed an innovative new cloud partnership with Box.
 
       In the second quarter, Global Services revenue
declined 11.0 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (10
points) and divestitures. Global Technology Services (GTS) declined 10.5
percent as reported, but increased 1 percent adjusted for currency (11 points)
and divestitures (1 point), with growth in all three lines of business on an
adjusted basis. On that basis, this represented a 2 point improvement from
first quarter 2015 year-to-year performance, driven by a combination of revenue
from the backlog and in-period revenue. Global Business Services (GBS) revenue
decreased 12.0 percent and 3 percent adjusted for currency which was relatively
consistent with past performance. Software revenue declined 10.1 percent and 3
percent adjusted for currency. Key branded middleware decreased 6.8 percent as
reported, but was flat year to year at constant currency. Systems Hardware
revenue decreased 31.7 percent as reported, but increased 5 percent adjusted
for the divested System x business (33 points) and currency (4 points) led by
double-digit growth in z Systems and mid-single digit growth in Power Systems,
adjusted for currency. 
 
  From a geographic perspective, revenue
in the major markets declined 11.0 percent as reported, but was flat year to
year adjusted for currency (9 points) and divestitures (2 points). Performance
in the major markets on an adjusted basis was consistent with the first quarter
of 2015 and was led by growth in Japan, Germany and the UK. Growth markets
revenue decreased 21.4 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for
divestitures (9 points) and currency (8 points). Revenue

performance
decelerated compared to the first quarter of 2015 driven primarily by the BRIC
(Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries, which declined by 35.3 percent as
reported and 18 percent adjusted for currency and divestitures. Revenue in the
BRIC countries impacted the company’s overall revenue growth rate by 2 points
in the second quarter on an adjusted basis. Total revenue growth, adjusted for
currency and divestitures, would have increased 1 percent excluding the BRIC
countries.  
 
  The consolidated gross profit margin
of 49.9 percent decreased 20 basis points versus the prior year. The operating
(non-GAAP) gross margin of 50.9 percent increased 20 basis points compared to
the prior year primarily driven by portfolio actions and the relative strength
of z Systems, partially offset by a decline in Global Services. 
 
  Total expense and other (income)
decreased 7.9 percent in the second quarter of 2015 versus the prior year.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 8.8 percent
compared to the prior year. The year-to-year drivers were approximately:

       The
reduction in expense was driven primarily by currency and the fact that the
divested System x business is no longer in the spending base. These benefits
were partially offset by a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges ($0.2
billion) and lower divestiture gains ($0.1 billion) year to year, driven
primarily by the gain associated with the divestiture of the customer care
business in the second quarter of 2014. The reduction in operating (non-GAAP)
expense was driven by the same factors. The company is continuing to shift
spending in its large operational expense base; driving productivity in some
areas, while significantly increasing investment in the strategic imperatives.
These investments are to build capabilities, much of which will be consumed as
a service, in key areas including Watson, Watson Health and Bluemix, with the
benefits realized over the longer term.
 
       Pre-tax
income from continuing operations of $4.2 billion decreased 21.0 percent year
to year but increased $1.2 billion sequentially from the first quarter. The
continuing operations effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was
16.5 percent, a decrease of 4.0 points versus the prior year. Income from
continuing operations of $3.5 billion decreased 17.1 percent and the net income
margin was 16.9 percent, a decrease of 0.7 points versus the second quarter of
2014. Losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $0.1 billion in
both the second quarter of 2015 and 2014. Net income of $3.4 billion decreased
16.6 percent year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing
operations of $4.6 billion decreased 18.3 percent year to year but increased
$1.0 billion sequentially from the first quarter. Operating (non-GAAP) income
from continuing operations of $3.8 billion decreased 14.9 percent and the
operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 18.2 percent
decreased 0.3 points. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from
continuing operations in the second quarter of 2015 was 17.2 percent versus
20.5 percent in the second quarter of 2014. The lower
tax rates were the result of a more favorable mix of geographic income year to
year, as well as one time net discrete benefits primarily due to foreign tax
audit activity which concluded in the second quarter. 
 
  Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations of $3.58 decreased 15.4 percent year to year. In the
second quarter of 2015, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares of its
common stock. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.84
decreased 13.3 percent versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from
discontinued operations was ($0.08) in the second quarter of 2015 compared to
($0.11) in the second quarter of 2014.
     
      The company generated $3.9 billion in cash flow
provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.3 billion when compared to
the second quarter of 2014, driven primarily by a lower level of cash tax
payments. Net cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was $0.9 billion
higher than the prior year, primarily due to lower net proceeds from net sales
of short-term marketable securities and other investments and increased cash
used for acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities of $2.6 billion
increased $0.3 billion compared to the second quarter of 2014, driven primarily
by lower debt issuances in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in common stock
repurchases.
  
       The second quarter results are a reflection of the
transformation in the company’s business as it moves to areas with longer-term
value in enterprise IT. In July 2015, the company disclosed that it expects to
deliver GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range
of $14.25 to $15.00, and it continues to expect to deliver operating (non-

GAAP) earnings between $15.75 and $16.50 per diluted
share from continuing operations for 2015. The company also stated that it now
expects a modest year-to-year improvement in free cash flow in 2015, even at
the low end of the operating (non-GAAP) earnings expectation.

Financial Performance Summary:
 
        In the first six months of 2015, the
company reported $40.4 billion in revenue, and delivered $5.9 billion in income
from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $6.01 as reported and $6.75 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The
results of continuing operations exclude a net loss from discontinued
operations of $0.2 billion in the first six months of 2015 and a net loss of
$0.3 billion in the first six months of 2014 related to the divestiture of the
Microelectronics business. On a consolidated basis, net income in the first six
months of 2015 was $5.8 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $5.84. The
company generated $7.5 billion in cash from operations and $4.5 billion in free
cash

flow in the first six months of 2015 enabling
shareholder returns of $4.7 billion in gross common stock repurchases and
dividends.
 
  Total consolidated revenue decreased
12.7 percent as reported, but was essentially flat year to year adjusted for
divestitures and currency in the first six months of 2015. Currency had an 8
point, or $3.8 billion impact on reported revenue in the six month period.
Additionally, revenue was impacted by 4 points in the first six months of 2015
from divested businesses. Combined, the impact of currency and divested
businesses reduced the reported revenue growth by 12 points. 
 
       The company continues to move aggressively and
decisively to transform the business as it moves to where the company sees the
longer-term value in enterprise IT. The company has been shifting investments
and resources, building partnerships and ecosystems and introducing key innovations.
Each one of its actions contributes to the company’s transformation and
improves the business for the long term. In the first half of 2015, strategic
imperatives revenue grew more than 20 percent year to year as reported, and
more than 30 percent adjusted for currency and divestitures. Growth accelerated
in the first half compared to the full-year 2014. These markets are also
growing, but with this performance the company is gaining share. The company’s
core portfolio declined ‒ in a declining market. Combined, the strategic
imperatives and the core portfolio delivered revenue at a consolidated level
that was essentially flat year to year in the first half adjusted for currency
and divestitures.  
 
       In the first six months of 2015, business analytics
revenue increased 12 percent as reported and more than 20 percent adjusted for
currency, which is above market rates. Growth was led by Global Business
Services and Systems Hardware, reflecting the new z13 mainframe and Power8
systems that specifically address analytics workloads. Cloud revenue was up
over 50 percent as reported and over 70 percent year to year adjusted for
currency and divestitures. The company had strong performance in both its
private foundations and its as-a-Service offerings. Security revenue increased
3 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency, and mobile revenue
quadrupled on both an as reported and constant currency basis. Social revenue
increased more than 30 percent as reported and more than 40 percent adjusted
for currency.    
 
       From a segment perspective, Global Services revenue
declined 11.3 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (10
points) and divestitures, reflecting an improving revenue trend on an adjusted
basis. Global Technology Services (GTS) declined 10.7 percent as reported, but
was flat adjusted for currency (10 points) and divestitures (1 point). Global
Business Services (GBS) revenue decreased 12.5 percent as reported and 4
percent adjusted for currency (9 points) and divestitures. Software revenue
declined 9.2 percent and 2 percent adjusted for currency; consistent with
performance in the second half of 2014 on an adjusted basis. Key branded
middleware decreased 6.0 percent as reported, but increased 1 percent at constant
currency. Systems Hardware revenue decreased 27.9 percent as reported, but
increased 15 percent adjusted for the divested System x business (39 points)
and currency (4 points). 
 
       From a
geographic perspective, revenue in the major markets declined 10.9 percent as
reported, but was flat year to year adjusted for currency (8 points) and
divestitures (3 points) with growth in Japan, Germany and the UK on an adjusted
basis. Growth markets revenue decreased 18.9 percent as reported and 3 percent
adjusted for divestitures (9 points) and currency (7 points) compared to the
first six months of 2014. Performance was driven by the BRIC countries, down
28.6 percent as reported and 11 percent adjusted for divestitures and currency.

 
       The consolidated gross margin of
49.1 percent was essentially flat year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) gross
margin of 50.1 percent increased 0.5 points versus the prior year primarily
driven by both portfolio actions and the relative strength of z Systems. 
 
       Total expense and other (income)
decreased 10.8 percent in the first six months of 2015 compared to the prior
year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 13.0
percent compared to the first six months of 2014. The key year-to-year drivers

The reduction in expense was driven primarily by currency impacts, a lower
level of workforce rebalancing charges ($0.4 billion) and the impact of the
divested System x business. These benefits were partially offset by the impact
of  lower divestiture gains ($0.2 billion) year to year and a current year
charge for an additional pension obligation in Spain ($0.2 billion). The reduction
in operating (non-GAAP) expense was driven by the same factors, excluding the
Spain pension obligation which was not reflected in operating (non-GAAP)
expense. The company is continuing to shift resources and spending to strategic
areas with the most opportunity. 
 
       Pre-tax
income from continuing operations decreased 15.3 percent and the pre-tax margin
was 17.9 percent, a decrease of 0.5 points versus the first six months of 2014.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2015
was 17.8 percent, a decrease of 2.7 points versus the prior year. Income from
continuing operations of $5.9 billion decreased 12.4 percent and the net income
margin was 14.7 percent, an increase of 0.1 points compared to the first six
months of 2014. Losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $0.2
billion in the first six months of 2015 versus $0.3 billion in the first six
months of 2014. Net income of $5.8 billion decreased 11.4 percent year to year.
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations decreased 10.1
percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from
continuing operations improved 0.6 points to 20.3 percent. Operating (non-GAAP)
income from continuing operations of $6.7 billion decreased 7.8 percent and the
operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 16.5 percent
increased 0.9 points. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from
continuing operations in the first six months of 2015 was 18.4 percent versus
20.5 percent in the first six months of 2014. The
lower tax rates were the result of a more favorable mix of geographic income
year to year, as well as one time net discrete benefits primarily due to
foreign tax audit activity which concluded in the second quarter of 2015. 
 
       Diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.01 decreased 9.2 percent
year to year. In the first six months of 2015, the company repurchased 14.5
million shares of its common stock. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per
share of $6.75 decreased 4.7 percent versus the prior year. Diluted earnings
per share from discontinued operations was ($0.17) in the first six months of
2015 compared to ($0.25) in the same period of 2014.
  
       At June 30, 2015, the company continued to have the
financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $8.8 billion, an increase of $0.3
billion from December 31, 2014. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash
flows were:
 
    Total assets decreased $4.8 billion
($1.6 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2014 driven by:
 
    ·        Decreases in total receivables ($4.7 billion), prepaid
expenses and sundry assets ($0.7 billion) and deferred taxes ($0.5 billion);
partially offset by
 
    ·       
Increased prepaid pension assets ($1.3
billion).
 
  Total liabilities decreased $6.6 billion ($4.0 billion
adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2014 driven by:
 
   ·   Decreases
in total debt ($2.1 billion), taxes ($1.4 billion), retirement-related
liabilities ($1.0 billion), accounts payable ($0.9 billion) and other accrued
expenses and liabilities ($0.7 billion). 
 
  Total equity of $13.8 billion increased $1.8 billion from
December 31, 2014 as a result of:
 
   ·       Higher retained earnings ($3.4 billion), higher common
stock ($0.4 billion) and lower accumulated other comprehensive losses ($0.4
billion); partially offset by
 
   ·       
Increased treasury stock ($2.4 billion).
 
       The company generated $7.5 billion in cash flow provided by
operating activities, an increase of $0.6 billion when compared to the first
six months of 2014, driven primarily by a lower level of income tax payments
($1.4 billion). Net cash used in investing activities of $1.4 billion was $0.4
billion higher than the prior year, primarily due to lower cash sourced from
net sales of short-term marketable securities and other investments ($0.7
billion) and a decrease in cash provided from divestitures ($0.3 billion),
partially offset by increased cash sourced from non-operating finance
receivables ($0.7 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $6.0
billion decreased $1.0 billion compared to the first six months of 2014, driven
primarily by a decrease in cash used for gross common stock repurchases ($9.5
billion), partially offset by a reduction in net cash sourced from debt
transactions ($8.1 billion) driven by lower issuances in 2015.

Global Services
 
       In the second quarter of 2015, the Global Services
segments, GTS and GBS, delivered combined revenue of $12,412 million, a
decrease of 11.0 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (10
points) and the System x divestiture. This performance represented a modest
improvement in the year to year revenue trajectory from the first quarter. In
the second quarter, the company had 22 signings greater than $100 million
balanced between renewals and new scope or new clients. Adjusted for currency,
this was the third consecutive quarter of signings growth and, as a result,
total services backlog at June 30, 2105 is up more than 1 percent at constant
currency. Pre-tax income in the second quarter decreased 29.0 percent and the
pre-tax margin decreased 3.8 points to 14.9 percent. 
 
       For the first six months of 2015, total Global
Services revenue was $24,616 million, a decrease of 11.3 percent as reported
and 1 percent adjusted for currency (10 points) and divestitures. Pre-tax
income in the first half of the year decreased 24.9 percent and the pre-tax
margin decreased 2.5 points to 13.8 percent.

       Global Technology Services revenue of $8,068 million
decreased 10.5 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency
(11 points) and the System x divestiture (1 point) in the second quarter of
2015 compared to the prior year. GTS revenue decreased 10.7 percent as reported
and was flat adjusted for currency (10 points) and the System x divestiture (1
point) in the first six months of the year. In the second quarter, GTS
outsourcing revenue of $4,314 million decreased 11.2 percent as reported, but
returned to growth of 1 percent adjusted for currency, representing a 3 point
sequential improvement adjusted for currency. Several large deals signed last
year are now completing transition. There has been good traction in the
contracts that combine traditional IT outsourcing with the integration of
mobility, hybrid cloud and analytics workloads. Integrated Technology Services
(ITS) revenue of $2,197 million decreased 8.3 percent as reported, but returned
to growth of 1 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter. Within ITS,
there was strong performance at constant currency in cloud, security and
business resiliency services. Growth in SoftLayer accelerated as the company
has significantly increased capacity and new datacenters since the beginning of
last year. There are now 41 cloud datacenters on five continents. Maintenance
revenue of $1,557 million decreased 11.2 percent as reported, but was up 2
percent in the second quarter adjusted for currency (10 points) and the System
x divestiture (4 points) driven by Multivendor Support Services. This is the
company’s hardware maintenance offering for third party platforms which
leverages its global distribution and inventory capabilities. 
 
       Global
Business Services revenue of $4,345 million decreased 12.0 percent as reported
and 3 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2015 compared to
the prior year. GBS revenue decreased 12.5 percent as reported and 4 percent
adjusted for currency (9 points) and divestitures in the first six months of
the year.  In the second quarter, Consulting and Systems Integration revenue of
$3,121 million declined 13.2 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for
currency. GBS Outsourcing revenue of $1,228 million decreased 8.6 percent as
reported, but was flat adjusted for currency in the second quarter. Revenue
declined in the practices focused on traditional back-office implementations.
Customers are migrating away from large ERP projects, toward smaller
initiatives, which are often contracted in an as-a-Service model. The company
has been shifting skills and work from these declining practices to the new
opportunity areas. There has been strong

growth rates
in the strategic imperatives, but there needs to be a more aggressive shift to
improve overall GBS business results. Long-term application management is
becoming more important to enterprise clients as the IT environment grows more
complex. Clients are integrating public and private cloud networks, deploying
new mobile capabilities into their employee and customer base and deploying
analytics around these solutions. These ongoing changes in clients’ needs drive
both shorter term systems integration as well as long-term management requirements
and, adjusted for currency, performance improved across Application Management
Services in the second quarter.

       The GTS gross profit margin decreased 2.3 points and
1.9 points in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively,
compared to prior year. In the second quarter, pre-tax income decreased 25.2
percent to $1,248 million and the pre-tax margin declined 2.9 points to 15.1
percent compared to the prior year. The second quarter year-to-year decrease in
pre-tax income was driven by several elements. Currency drove the largest
year-to-year impact given the strengthening dollar. The business continues to
generate significant profits and cash flow in local currencies, but the
translation of those currencies to U.S. dollars significantly affects reported
profit growth. Within GTS, maintenance profit and margin were impacted by the
System x divestiture. Additionally, the business took a workforce rebalancing
charge in the quarter, essentially all of which resulted in a year-to-year
impact. Profit and margin performance also reflected the continued investments
for growth in the strategic imperatives offerings including bringing additional
SoftLayer capacity online and increasing security and mobility go-to-market
skills. There are also investments to open new resiliency datacenters and
expand global delivery capabilities. While the company looks to productivity as
a way to fund investments, the business did not drive that productivity this
quarter as the company must always balance the timing of its transformation
with the dynamics of running its clients’ most critical processes.
  
  The GBS gross profit margin decreased 2.4 points and 2.1
points in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively,
compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, pre-tax income decreased
35.3 percent to $656 million and pre-tax margin declined 5.3 points to 14.7
percent compared to the prior year. There were a few drivers of the pre-tax
income decline. The largest impact was from the customer care divestiture,
which drove 9 points of the year-to-year decline in profit due to the sizable
gain reflected in the 2014 results. This year, there was an increased level of
investments to further enable

partnerships, and the
company hired or reskilled additional go-to-market and delivery practitioner
resources for the fast-growing strategic imperative offerings. For example,
over the past 12 months, over 2,000 incremental resources were hired into the
mobility practices and approximately 1,000 resources were shifted to analytics
projects. The remaining margin decline was driven by lower revenue on what is a
relatively fixed cost base in the short term. The company remains focused on
cost competitiveness through alternate labor models, more aggressively shifting
resources to higher-value offerings and enhancing its global delivery
capabilities.
  
Global
Services Backlog
 
      
The estimated Global

to the June 30, 2014 balance. The
estimated transactional backlog at June 30, 2015 decreased 12.1 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency) from the June 30, 2014 levels. The estimated
outsourcing backlog decreased 8.6 percent as reported, but increased 4 percent

        Total Global Services backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS,

Outsourcing backlog includes GTS Outsourcing and GBS Outsourcing. Transactional
backlog includes ITS and Consulting and Systems Integration. Total backlog is
intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and therefore does
include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected
by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts,
periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and
adjustments for currency.
 
Global Services signings are management’s
initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a Global Services
contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the
calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates
and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type
and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or
wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS
Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems Integration
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in
signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues
equal renewals.
 
Contract portfolios purchased in an
acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those
contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing
will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or
coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       Software revenue of $5,830 million
decreased 10.1 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency year to
year in the second quarter of 2015. While key branded middleware revenue was flat
adjusted for currency in the second quarter, total software performance
reflected a headwind from operating systems and other middleware. In the second
quarter, operating systems decreased 16.5 percent as reported and 9 percent
adjusted for currency, and other middleware decreased 19.3 percent as reported
and 12 percent adjusted for currency. For the first six months of the year,
software revenue of $11,028 million decreased 9.2 percent as reported and 2
percent adjusted for currency. The year-to-date revenue performance was
consistent with the second half of 2014.
  
       Key branded middleware revenue of
$4,030 million, which accounted for 69 percent of total software revenue in the
second quarter, decreased 6.8 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for
currency compared to the prior year period. While Websphere grew year to year
on an adjusted basis, the growth was offset by decreases across the other
brands. For the first six months of 2015, key branded middleware revenue of
$7,502 million decreased 6.0 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted
for currency.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       In the
second quarter of 2015, there was revenue growth at constant currency across
the solution areas including security, commerce and social. Within these
solution areas, there was strong growth in Software-as-a-Service offerings.
Security software returned to double-digit growth adjusted for currency in the
second quarter as the company’s security solutions bring together the
intelligence, integration and expertise that are essential in the world of
advanced threats. Commerce software also grew on an adjusted basis as the
company’s solutions allow clients to gain unique insights about their
customers. Nine of the top 10 U.S. retailers and each of the top 10 global
banks run on the company’s commerce solutions. Social solutions again grew
double-digits adjusted for currency driven by strong performance in both Kenexa
and advanced collaboration offerings.
 
       The company is continuing to bring
innovations to its solutions areas and deepen its industry focus. Watson is an
example of where the company is creating a market around cognitive computing
and building an as-a-Service business. Watson is deployed across nearly 30
countries and in 20 industries. The company is currently working on hundreds of
projects to expand industry domain knowledge, as well as teaching the system
new languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Arabic. There is
continued expansion of Watson’s reach by forging additional partnerships.
Recently, the company announced the formation of a joint venture with Mubadala
to bring Watson to the Middle East and North Africa with a focus on healthcare,
retail, education, banking and finance. 
 
       Overall, the company’s focus in
software continues to be on innovation, partnership and aligning to the needs
of its customers and the industries in which they operate.

       The
Software gross profit margin decreased 1.0 points to 87.8 percent in the second
quarter and decreased 1.0 points to 87.2 percent for the first six months of
2015 compared to the prior year. Software pre-tax income of $2,272 million in
the second quarter decreased 15.3 percent, with a pre-tax margin of 34.4
percent, a decrease of 2.1 points. Profit performance in Software in the second
quarter was a reflection of the overall revenue performance, a higher level of
investments in areas like Watson and Bluemix, and an impact from currency
translation. Software pre-tax income for the first six months of the year
decreased 8.5 percent to $4,208 million with a pre-tax margin of 33.0 percent,
flat year to year.

       In the second quarter of 2015,
Systems Hardware revenue of $2,058 million decreased 31.7 percent as reported,
but grew 5 percent year to year adjusted for the divestiture of the System x
business (33 points) and currency (4 points). Performance reflected the
company’s ability to continue to deliver innovation across its high-end systems
and the actions taken to reposition the portfolio. For the first six months of
the year, revenue of  $3,717 million decreased 27.9 percent as reported, but
grew 15 percent adjusted for the divestiture of the System x business (39
points) and currency (4 points) reflecting growth in both z Systems and Power
Systems on an adjusted basis. The capabilities of both mainframe and Power
systems are resonating well with customers and the company continues to add new
customers to these platforms.
 
       The z Systems revenue increased 9.2
percent as reported and 15 percent adjusted for currency, and 40.8 percent as
reported and 49 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter and first
six months of 2015, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. In the
second quarter, MIPS (millions of instructions per second) increased 24 percent
year to year. Shipments of the new z13 mainframe began in the first quarter of 2015
and its performance is in line with previous cycles.  
 
       Power Systems revenue decreased 0.8
percent as reported, but grew 5 percent adjusted for currency. There was growth
in both the low-end and the high-end systems where the company has introduced
new Power8-based systems. For the first six months of the year, revenue
decreased 1.8 percent as reported, but grew 3 percent adjusted for currency. On
an adjusted basis, Power performance was led by strong growth in scale-out
systems which are capturing both the UNIX and Linux opportunity. The company’s
OpenPOWER strategy continues to take hold globally. In June, the UK government
joined the United States as the second major government to turn to OpenPOWER
for its high performance computing priorities. 
 
       Storage revenue decreased 9.8
percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter
compared to the prior year. During the second quarter, there was continued
strong growth in FlashSystems. However, this growth was offset by the wind down
of the OEM business and continued weakness in high-end disk. For the first six
months of 2015, revenue decreased 8.9 percent as reported and 3 percent
adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.

       The
Systems Hardware gross profit margin of 48.2 percent increased 8.5 points in
the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year. The increase was due to
mix (12.8 points) driven by the strong growth in z Systems and the divestiture
of the lower margin System x business. This improvement was offset by a
decrease due to margin (4.4 points), with lower margins in z Systems (3.9
points) and Power Systems (1.6 points). The Systems Hardware gross profit
margin of 46.5 percent increased 9.2 points in the first six months of 2015
versus the prior year. The increase was due to mix (14.7 points) driven by the
strong growth in z Systems and the divestiture of the lower margin System x
business. This improvement was offset by a decrease due to margin (5.5 points),
with lower margins in z Systems (4.0 points), Power Systems (1.5 points) and
Storage (0.3 points).
  
       Systems
Hardware pre-tax income of $255 million increased 26.2 percent year to year in
the second quarter of 2015. For the first six months of the year, pretax income
was $279 million, an increase of $534 million compared to the prior year.
Pre-tax margin increased 5.5 points in the second quarter and increased 11.7
points in the first six months versus the prior year periods. The revenue
growth, on an adjusted basis, and the profitability improvement in the Systems
Hardware business is a clear result of the actions the company has taken to
position this business for the future.

* Adjusted for divestitures and currency. 



 
       Total geographic revenue of $20,730 million
decreased 13.4 percent as reported and was down 1 percent adjusted for currency
(9 points) and divestitures (4 points) in the second quarter of 2015 compared
to the prior year. Major market countries decreased 11.0 percent as reported
and, consistent with the first quarter, were flat adjusted for currency (9
points) and divestitures (2 points). While both EMEA and Japan grew on an
adjusted basis, this growth was offset by a year-to-year decline in the Americas.
Growth market countries decreased 21.4 percent as reported and 5 percent
adjusted for divestitures (9 points) and currency (8 points) driven by the BRIC
countries.
  
 Within the growth markets, the BRIC
countries combined second quarter revenue decreased 35.3 percent as reported
and 18 percent adjusted for divestitures (10 points) and currency (8 points).
On an adjusted basis, the BRIC’s performance impacted the company’s overall
revenue growth rate by 2 points in the second quarter. While India grew on an
adjusted basis, the other three countries were down at a double-digit rate.
India decreased 10.5 percent as reported, but grew 3 percent adjusted for
divestitures (8 points) and currency (5 points) building on improved
operational performance in services. Brazil decreased 36.6 percent as reported
and 16 percent adjusted for currency (19 points) and divestitures (1 point).
This was a tough comparison to the second quarter of the prior year when Brazil
grew over 20 percent on an adjusted basis. Year to year in the second quarter,
Russia decreased 43.9 percent as reported and 30 percent adjusted for
divestitures as volatility in the company’s transactional results in this
country continued. China decreased 40.0 percent as reported and 25 percent
adjusted for divestitures (15 points) and currency with fewer large
transactions in the quarter. Outside of the BRIC countries, growth markets
revenue was down 11.3 percent as reported, but grew 5 percent adjusted for
currency (9 points) and divestitures (7 points). This represented a 4 point
improvement from first-quarter 2015 year-to-year performance on an adjusted
basis. During the second quarter, many of the other countries improved their
performance sequentially on an adjusted basis.

       Americas revenue of $9,817 million decreased 7.8
percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency (3 points) and
divestitures (2 points) compared to the second quarter of 2014 with declines in
both the major markets and Latin American growth markets. North America declined
6.1 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for divestitures (2 points) and
currency (1 point). Although there was good z Systems performance and signing
of substantial new services business in the second quarter, overall the U.S.
decreased 4.6 percent and 3 percent adjusted for divestitures. Canada was down
16.0 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency (11 points) and
divestitures (3 points), but had sequential improvement from the first quarter
of 2015. The Latin American growth markets decreased 19.0 percent as reported
and 1 percent adjusted for currency (15 points) and divestitures (3 points)
compared to the second quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, the decline in
Brazil was partially offset by growth in a number of other Latin American
countries including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. 
 
  EMEA second quarter revenue of $6,570
million decreased 17.3 percent as reported, but returned to growth of 1 percent
adjusted for currency (15 points) and divestitures (4 points) on a year-to-year

selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 7.4 percent in
the second quarter of 2015 versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily
driven by currency (8 points) and the impact of the divested System x business
(2 points), partially offset by higher workforce rebalancing charges (4
points). Operating (non-GAAP) expense decreased 7.8 percent year to year driven
by primarily the same factors. 
 
       SG&A
expense decreased 11.2 percent in the first six months of 2015 versus the first
six months of 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by currency (8 points),
lower workforce rebalancing charges (3 points) and the impact of the divested
System x business (2 points), partially offset by an increase in
retirement-related costs which included an additional retirement-related
obligation of $230 million related to a court ruling in Spain. Operating
(non-GAAP) expense decreased 13.3 percent year to year driven by primarily the
same factors, excluding the Spain pension obligation which was not reflected in
operating (non-GAAP) expense. Bad debt expense increased $35 million year to
year. The receivables provision coverage was 2.7 percent at June 30, 2015, an
increase of 50 basis points from year-end 2014 and 80 basis points from June
30, 2014.

       The increase in
income of $99 million year over year in the second quarter was primarily driven
by higher gains on derivative instruments ($148 million) and higher foreign
currency transaction gains ($30 million), partially offset by a lower level of
gains on divestitures ($102 million), primarily associated with divestiture of
the customer care business in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in
income of $115 million year over year in the first six months was primarily
driven by increased gains on derivative instruments ($330 million), partially
offset by a reduction in gains on divestitures ($201 million), primarily
associated with divestiture of the customer care business in the prior year.

       The decrease in interest expense in the second quarter and first
six months of 2015 versus the same periods of 2014 was primarily driven by
lower average debt levels, partially
offset by higher average interest rates. Interest expense is presented in cost
of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related
external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.
Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second
quarter and first six months of 2015 was $252 million and $499 million,
respectively, a decrease of $7 million and $20 million, respectively, versus
the comparable prior year periods.

        In the second
quarter of 2015, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $92
million compared to the second quarter of 2014, primarily driven by an increase
in recognized actuarial losses ($194 million) and lower expected return on plan
assets ($132 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($180 million)
and lower defined contribution plan costs ($43 million). Total cost for the
first six months of 2015 increased by $371 million versus the first six months
of 2014, primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($392
million), higher pension obligations resulting from a court ruling in Spain
($175 million) and lower expected return on plan assets ($258 million),
partially offset by lower interest cost ($353 million) and lower defined
contribution plan costs ($78 million).   
   
    As
discussed in the “Snapshot” on page 48, the company characterizes certain
retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing
this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter
of 2015 were $375 million, a decrease of $41 million compared to the second
quarter of 2014, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plans cost ($43
million). Non-operating costs of $186 million increased $133 million in the
second quarter of 2015 year to year, driven primarily by an increase in
recognized actuarial losses ($194 million) and lower expected return on plan
assets ($132 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($180 million).
For the first six months of 2015, operating retirement-related costs were $753
million, a decrease of $81 million compared to the first six months of 2014,
primarily driven by lower defined contribution plan costs ($78 million).
Non-operating costs of $627 million increased $453 million in the first six
months of 2015 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in
recognized actuarial losses ($392

million), higher
pension obligations resulting from a court ruling in Spain ($175 million) and
lower expected return on plan assets ($258 million), partially offset by lower
interest cost ($353 million).
 
Taxes
 
        The continuing operations effective tax rate for the second
quarter of 2015 was 16.5 percent, a decrease of 4.0 points compared to the
second quarter of 2014. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the
first six months of 2015 was 17.8 percent, a decrease of 2.7 points compared to
the first six months of 2014. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second
quarter of 2015 was 17.2 percent, a decrease of 3.3 points versus the second
quarter of 2014. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of
2015 was 18.4 percent, a decrease of 2.1 points versus the first six months of
2014. 
 
       The lower rates in both periods were the
result of a more favorable mix of geographic income year to year, as well as
one time net discrete benefits primarily due to foreign tax audit activity
which concluded in the second quarter (approximately $127 million).
 
       With respect to major U.S. state and
foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax
examinations for years prior to 2008. The company is no longer subject to
income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2011.
The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the
amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
       The amount of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2014 increased by $8 million in the second quarter of 2015 and
increased by $60 million in the first six months of 2015 to $5,164 million. The
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably
affect the effective tax rate was $4,208 million at June 30, 2015.
 
       In April 2010, the company appealed the
determination of the Japanese Tax Authorities with respect to certain foreign
tax losses. The tax benefit of these losses, approximately $980 million
adjusted for currency, has been included in unrecognized tax benefits. In April
2011, the company received notification that the appeal was denied, and in June
2011, the company filed a lawsuit challenging this decision. In May 2014, the
Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of the company. The Japanese government
appealed the ruling to the Tokyo High Court. On March 25, 2015, the Tokyo High
Court ruled in favor of IBM and, on April 7, 2015, the Japanese government appealed
the ruling to the Japan Supreme Court. No final determination has been reached
on this matter.   
 
       In the fourth quarter of 2013, the
company received a draft tax assessment notice, currently valued at
approximately $842 million from the Indian Tax Authorities for 2009. The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a
meaningful indicator of liability. At June 30, 2015, the company has recorded
$498 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this
balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the company’s
right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the Indian Tax
Authorities.
 
      
In the first quarter of 2014, the IRS commenced its audit of the company’s U.S.
income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. The company anticipates that this audit
will be completed by the end of 2015.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

the second quarter and first six months of 2015 were 18.5 million and 34.0
million shares lower, respectively, than the same periods in 2014. The decrease
was primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program.
  
Results of
Discontinued Operations
       The loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was $77 million and $165 million in the second quarter
and first six months, respectively, of 2015 compared to $115 million and $261
million in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, of 2014. The
discontinued operations effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 was
30.5 percent compared to 35.1 percent in the second quarter of 2014 and was
28.3 percent in the first six months of 2015 compared to 31.2 percent in the
prior year period.  
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At June 30, 2015, the company continued to have the
financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $8,760 million. Total debt of $38,668 million decreased $2,136 million from prior
year-end levels, driven by maturities of $4,463 million, partially offset by
new debt issuances of $2,768 million. Within total debt, $26,098 million, or
approximately 67 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business. The
company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital
preservation and liquidity objectives. In the first
six months of 2015, the company generated $7,494 million in cash from
operations, an increase of $589 million compared to the first six  months of 2014. The company has consistently
generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to
additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its $10 billion global credit facility. 
 
       The assets and debt associated with the Global
Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial
position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are
the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in
the separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 79, are supplementary
data presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.

·        
A decline of $2,948 million

receivables primarily due to collections of higher year-end balances; and 
 
·        
A decline of $973
million ($633 million adjusted for currency) in trade and other accounts
receivable driven by collections of higher year-end balances; and
 
·        
A decline of $496
million (a decrease of $352 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses
and other current assets driven by decreases in derivative assets and
counterparty collateral postings, partially offset by
 
·        
An increase of $367 million ($369

       Current liabilities
decreased $4,065 million ($3,022 million adjusted for currency), as a result
of:
 
·        
A decrease
in taxes of $1,445 million ($1,305 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by income tax payments; and     
 
·        
A decrease in accounts payable of
$922 million ($774 million adjusted for currency)
reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances and the wind-down
of the divested System x business payables; and     
 
·        
A decrease in other
accrued expenses and liabilities
of $712 million ($549 million adjusted for currency) driven by workforce
rebalancing payments; and     
 
·        
A decrease in deferred
income of $545 million driven
by currency related declines of $378 million; and
 
·        
A decrease in
short-term debt of $402 million ($325 million adjusted for currency) primarily
as a result of maturities of $4,463 million, partially offset by
reclassifications of $3,334 million from long term to reflect upcoming
maturities and issuances of $622 million.
 
Cash Flow
 
       The company’s cash flows from operating, investing
and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts

       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate
long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset
portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 83.
 
       Non-Global Financing debt of $12,571 million was up
$869 million from December 31, 2014, but decreased $4,514 million from the
second quarter of 2014. 
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
       “Core”
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
55.4 percent at June 30, 2015 compared to 59.4 percent at December 31, 2014 and
56.1 percent at June 30, 2014. The year to year change was primarily driven by
the reduction in non-Global Financing debt, partially offset by pension,
currency and the Microelectronics divestiture-related charges in the second
half of 2014.            
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization
ratio at June 30, 2015 was 73.6 percent versus 77.3 percent at December 31,
2014 and 72.6 percent at June 30, 2014.   
 
Equity
 
       Total equity increased by $1,823 million from
December 31, 2014 as a result of an increase in retained earnings of $3,425
million, an increase in retirement-related amounts of $1,077 million, and an increase
in common stock of $393 million, partially offset by an increase in treasury
stock of $2,447 million primarily due to common stock repurchases and declines
of $549 million related to currency translation.

Looking Forward 
 
       The company measures the success of its business
model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The company’s
strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective of
optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the
company is well-positioned to take advantage of major shifts occurring in
technology, business and the global economy.
 
       Within the IT industry, there are major shifts
occurring—driven by data, cloud and changes in the ways individuals and
enterprises are engaging. In February 2015, the company met with investors to
discuss how it is transforming the business to where the company sees the long
term value in enterprise IT. The company’s strategic direction is clear and
compelling, and the company has been successful in shifting to the higher value
areas. The strong revenue growth in the strategic imperatives confirms that, as
does the overall profitability of the business. The company expects the
industry to continue to shift. The company expects revenue from its strategic
imperatives to continue to grow at a double-digit rate. These offerings are as
high value as other parts of the business, which continue to manage clients’
most critical business processes. As the cloud business gets to scale, and with
ongoing productivity improvements across the business, the company expects to
have an opportunity to expand margin. In addition, the company expects to
continue to allocate its capital efficiently and effectively to investments, and
to return value to its shareholders through a combination of dividends and
share repurchases. Over the longer term, in considering the opportunities it
will continue to develop, the company expects to have the ability to generate
low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher value business mix, high
single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash
flow realization in the 90’s percent range. This is a longer term growth
trajectory, not an absolute end point or a multi-year objective.
 
       In the first half of 2015, the company continued to
see signs that its transformation efforts are working. The company continues to
move aggressively and decisively to reshape the business to best address the
long term value in enterprise IT. The company continued to shift investments
and resources, establish new partnerships and ecosystems and introduce new
innovations to the marketplace. Each action that the company takes contributes
to its transformation and improves the business for the long term. However,
these actions also impact the current year. In the first half, total revenue
was essentially flat year to year, adjusted for currency and the impact of
divested businesses. Revenue from the strategic imperatives grew more than 30 percent
adjusted for currency and divestitures. There was significant strength in
high-end systems, as the company’s new products address the most contemporary
workloads in data, cloud and mobile. This strength, together with the overall
shift to higher value and the company’s portfolio actions, drove margin
expansion for the company. In addition, the company made several bold moves
that build on the momentum started in 2014, including: the introduction of the
z13 mainframe; the hybrid cloud announcement; a set of initiatives around the
Internet of Things; the launch of Watson Health; the completion of the
Microelectronics divestiture; the breakthrough in semiconductor innovation in 7
nanometer technology; the announcement that Spark technology will be embedded
into the analytics and commerce platforms; and, the new cloud partnership with
Box.  
   
       Looking forward in 2015, in July 2015, the company
stated that it expects to deliver GAAP earnings per share from continuing
operations to be in the range of $14.25 to $15.00, and it continues to expect
operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be in the range of $15.75 to $16.50.
The company stated earlier in 2015 that it expected to improve its free cash
flow realization year to year, and that it expected realization to be in the
mid to high 80’s percent level in 2015. In July 2015, the company stated that
it expects full year realization to be about 90 percent. Therefore, even at the
low end of the operating (non-GAAP) profit range, the company now expects a
modest year to year improvement in free cash flow for the year. Consistent with
its prior expectations, the primary variable between the high and low end of
the operating (non-GAAP) profit range is the software revenue trajectory for
the year. From a margin perspective, for the full year, the company continues
to expect to expand operating (non-GAAP) margins, primarily driven by the
portfolio actions. The company also expects to continue a high level of
investment – shifting that investment to areas where it sees the best
opportunities. In addition, the company will continue to return value to
shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends. 
 
       In the present currency environment, and considering
the impact from the completed divestitures, total revenue as reported is
expected to decline in 2015. At July 2015 spot rates, the company expects the
negative impact from currency on revenue to be approximately 8-9 points in the
third quarter and approximately 7-8 points for the full year. The impact of
divested businesses is expected to be 4 points in the third quarter and 3
points for the full year 2015. Therefore, the
combined negative impact of currency at these spot rates and the divested
businesses is expected to be approximately 12 points in the third quarter and
10-11 points for the full year. Also, as with all companies with a
similar global business profile, with the dollar strengthening, the company
expects currency will have a significant translation impact on its profit
growth. The estimated impact to operating (non-GAAP) earnings growth in the
first half was approximately $0.35 per share. Based on first-half performance
and July 2015 spot rates, the company now expects currency to impact operating
(non-GAAP) 

75



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

earnings year-to-year growth by more than
$0.80 per share for the full year. The expected impact from currency has
worsened slightly from April 2015. In the third quarter, over the past few
years, the company has typically seen about a $1 billion decrease in revenue
from the second to the third quarter. The company expects this year would be no
different than the typical seasonality – therefore, with approximately $1
billion less revenue quarter-to-quarter, third quarter revenue would be about
the same as the first quarter of 2015. What will be different in 2015 is the
mix of business relative to the historical track, but even with that, the
company expects to continue to expand operating (non-GAAP) margins in the third
quarter, driven by the portfolio actions. When examining some of the other
dynamics in the third quarter, from a year to year perspective – currency
impact, level of investments, workforce rebalancing charges – the third quarter
profit trajectory looks similar to the second quarter. There are some
differences – for example, there was no divestiture gain in the third quarter
of 2014 financial results, but, on balance, the company expects that the year
to year profit would be similar to the second quarter. This would be the same
for the operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share trajectory as well. Through the
first half of 2015, relative to the low end of the operating (non-GAAP)
earnings per share expectations, the company’s performance is at the same point
as the prior year, and ahead of 2013 performance. In the third quarter, as
described above, the company expects to end the quarter with approximately
63-64 percent of the low end of the earnings per share guidance achieved,
consistent with prior years. Where the company finishes the year within its
expectations range will primarily depend on whether there is a change in
trajectory of the software business. Importantly, as the company progresses
with its transformation, the company expects to exit 2015 as a higher value
business.
 
       Within the company’s earnings per share expectation
for 2015, with the flow through from the prior year share reduction, the first
half repurchase amount and the remaining authorization, the company is
expecting a 2-3 point benefit from share repurchases—less than the benefit in
2014. At the end of June 2015, the company had approximately $4 billion of
repurchase authorization remaining.  
 
  The company expects, in the normal
course of business, that its effective tax rate and operating (non-GAAP) tax
rate will be approximately 20 percent. The tax rate in the first half of 2015
reflected a benefit from certain discrete items. The rate will change year to
year based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits
and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic
mix of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend
repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income
tax strategies.
 
       The company expects 2015 pre-tax retirement-related
plan cost to be approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of approximately $600
million compared to 2014. This estimate reflects current pension plan
assumptions at December 31, 2014. Within total retirement-related plan cost,
operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5
billion, a decrease of approximately $100 million versus 2014. Non-operating
retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, an
increase of approximately $700 million compared to 2014, driven by increased
recognized actuarial losses and the additional Spain pension-related
obligation. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be
approximately $2.7 billion in 2015, an increase of approximately $100 million
compared to 2014.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At June 30, 2015, currency changes resulted in assets and
liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars
than at year-end 2014. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit
specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. 
 
      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this
information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could
take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the 

76



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share
growth in the first six months of 2015. Based on the currency rate movements in
the first six months of 2015, total revenue decreased 12.7 percent as reported
and decreased 4.5 percent at constant currency versus the first six months of 2014.
On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these
translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in
a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) decrease of
approximately $450 million in the first six months of 2015 on an as reported
basis, and a decrease of approximately $600 million on an operating (non-GAAP)
basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in a decrease of approximately $30
million in the first six months of 2014 on both an as reported and operating
(non-GAAP) basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum
impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational
responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and
timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency
impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be
substantially less than the theoretical maximum
given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
 
      
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
        The
company continues to monitor the economic conditions in Venezuela. In
March 2013, the Venezuelan government created a new foreign exchange
mechanism called the “Complimentary System of Foreign Currency Acquirement” (or
the “SICAD 1”). This system operates similar to an auction system and allows
entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be used for specific
import transactions. In March 2014, the company adopted the SICAD 1 rate of
10.7 BsF per USD. In the first quarter of 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax
loss of $31 million as a result of the devaluation in Other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In February 2015, the
Venezuelan government created a new foreign exchange platform, the Marginal
Currency System, or SIMADI.  The company will continue to monitor transactions
from these exchange systems going-forward in 2015.  At the June 30, 2015 SICAD
rate of 12.8 Bolivar to the U.S. dollar, the company’s net asset position in
Venezuela was $47 million, reflecting a $3 million currency loss recorded in
the second quarter. The company’s operations in Venezuela comprised less than 1
percent of total 2014 and 2013 revenue, respectively.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2014 Annual Report, on pages 65 to 68,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 65 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2015, those amounts are $7.5
billion for net cash from operating activities, $8.8 billion of cash and
marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. The company’s five-year global credit facility expires on
November 10, 2019. 
 
      The major rating agencies’ ratings
on the company’s debt securities at June 30, 2015 appear in the table below.
The agency ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2014. Standard and
Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings reaffirmed their credit ratings
on April 21, 2015, March 30, 2015 and June 24, 2015, respectively. The company
does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or
documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and
seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit
rating. The company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments
contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the
agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At June 30, 2015, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability
position was $212 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is
subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of
the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no
other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating,
would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

        Free
cash flow of $4,450 million for the first six months of 2015 increased $844
million year to year. The increase was driven primarily by a reduction in cash
tax payments of $1.4 billion compared to the first half of 2014 and an
improvement in sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by the
remaining working capital impact to cash flow from the System x divestiture
($0.2 billion), a higher level of payments for performance-based compensation
($0.5 billion) which was accrued for in 2014 and performance-related declines
in net income. Net capital expenditures of $1.8 billion increased $34 million
year to year, and spending included a shift as the company continues to build
out the cloud data centers. In the first six months of 2015, the company
continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders
including $2.4 billion in dividends and $2.3 billion in gross common stock
repurchases. 
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2014 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe
downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in note 12, “Contingencies,” in this
Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $600 million in 2015. Contributions related to all
retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2015.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum
contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent
remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.  
 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity
options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional
funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit
facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany
loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.  
 
        The company does earn a significant amount
of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The company’s policy is to indefinitely
reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and
accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a
portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional
U.S. tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any,
associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the
company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign
subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for operations and obligations in the
U.S., the company could elect to repatriate these funds which could result in a
reassessment of the company’s policy and increased tax expense.

       The decrease in revenue
in the second quarter, as compared to the same period in 2014, was due to:
 
·        
A decline in external revenue of
5.2 percent as reported, but an increase of 7.0 percent adjusted for currency,
due to a decrease in financing revenue (down 12.4 percent to $344 million),
partially offset by an increase in equipment sales revenue (up 19.4 percent to
$132 million); partially offset by
 
·        
An increase in internal revenue of
2.7 percent, due to an increase in used equipment sales revenue (up 6.9 percent
to $627 million), partially offset by a decrease in financing revenue (down
22.1 percent to $77 million).
 
       The decrease in revenue
in the first six months, as compared to the same period in 2014, was due to:
 
·        
A decline in external revenue of
7.5 percent as reported, but an increase of 2.9 percent adjusted for currency,
due to decreases in financing revenue (down 8.9 percent to $714 million) and equipment
sales revenue (down 3.5 percent to $223 million); and
 
·        
A decline in internal revenue of
1.0 percent, due to a decrease in financing revenue (down 18.5 percent to $170
million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales revenue (up
2.4 percent to $1,120 million).
 
       The decreases in both
external and internal financing revenue in the second quarter and for the first
six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, were due to a decrease
in the average asset balance as well as lower asset yields. 
        
       Global Financing gross profit
decreased 2.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same
period in 2014, due to a decrease in financing gross profit, partially offset
by an increase in used equipment sales gross profit. Gross profit decreased 7.6
percent in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014,
due to decreases in financing gross profit and used equipment sales gross
profit. The gross profit margin decreased 1.4 points and 2.7 points in the second
quarter and for the first six months respectively, of 2015, compared to the
same periods in 2014, due to margin decreases in financing and used equipment
sales.
 
       Global Financing pre-tax
income increased 3.5 percent to $613 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared
to the same period in 2014, due to decreases in financing receivables
provisions ($22 million) and in selling, general and administrative expenses
($20 million), partially offset by the decrease in gross profit ($22 million).
Pre-tax income decreased 5.1 percent to $1,128 million in the first six months
of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due to the decrease in gross
profit ($124 million), partially offset by decreases in selling, general and
administrative expenses ($60 million) and in

financing
receivables provisions ($4 million). The decreases in financing receivables
provisions for both periods were due to lower specific reserve requirements in
the current year.
 
      The increase in return on
equity in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period of 2014, was
due to a lower average equity balance and the increase in after-tax income. The
decrease in return on equity for the first six months of 2015, compared to the
same period of 2014, was due to the decrease in after-tax income, partially
offset by a lower average equity balance.

Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist of IBM systems, software and services, and OEM equipment,
software and services to meet IBM clients’ total solutions requirements. Client
financing assets are primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating
leases for systems products, as well as loans for systems, software and
services, with terms up to seven years. Global Financing’s client loans are
primarily for software and services and are unsecured. These loans are
subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed
necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks in the loan agreements which
include covenants to protect against credit deterioration during the life of
the obligation. 
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
        In addition to the actions previously described, in
certain circumstances, the company may take mitigation actions to transfer
credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees,
non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in
accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
       At June 30, 2015, substantially all financing assets
were IT related assets, and approximately 57 percent of the total external
portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to
consumers.

      Cash collections of both
commercial financing and client financing assets exceeded new financing
originations in the first six months of 2015 which resulted in a net decline in
financing assets from December 2014.  New originations of both client financing
and commercial financing assets exceeded cash collections in the second quarter
of 2015, which resulted in a net increase in financing assets in this quarter.
The increase in originations in the second quarter of 2015 was due to an
increase in volumes in client financing compared to the second quarter of 2014.
The decrease in originations in the first six months of 2014 was due to a
decrease in volumes in commercial financing compared to the same period in the
prior year.
 
        Cash generated by Global Financing was deployed to pay
intercompany payables and dividends to IBM as well as business partners and OEM
suppliers.

       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.9 percent at December 31, 2014, to 2.4 percent at
June 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in specific reserve requirements.
Specific reserves increased 17 percent from $484 million at December 31, 2014,
to $565 million at June 30, 2015. Unallocated reserves decreased 9 percent from
$96 million at December 31, 2014, to $87 million at June 30, 2015,
primarily due to the decline in gross financing receivables.   
 
       Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $43 million for the three months ended June
30, 2015, compared to $65 million for the same period in 2014.  Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $94 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015, compared to $98 million for the same period in 2014.  The year-to-year
decreases in bad debt expense were due to lower specific reserve requirements,
primarily in China, in the current year.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

  
Residual
Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from lease returns,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned off of a lease,
surplus internal equipment, or used equipment purchased externally. These sales
represented 64.4 percent and 60.4 percent of Global Financing's revenue in the
second quarter and first six months, respectively, of 2015, and 58.7 percent
and 57.2 percent in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, of
2014. The increases in both periods were due to a higher volume of used
equipment sales for internal transactions. The gross profit margins on these
sales were 66.8 percent and 67.1 percent in the second quarter of 2015 and
2014, respectively. The gross profit margins were 65.4 percent and 67.5 percent
in the first six months of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the
gross profit margin for the six month period ending June 30, 2015 was primarily
driven by a margin decrease in internal equipment sales.
 
       The
table below presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2015 and June
30, 2015. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of
the related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at June 30, 2015 is expected to
be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on
a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of
the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While primarily focused on IBM
products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM products. These
third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided for
by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for the
covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments
that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type
lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values
associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $360 million and $117 million
for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30,
2015 and 2014, respectively and $461 million and $203 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate asset values
associated with the guarantees of direct financing leases were $47 million and
$56 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended
June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $96 million and $101 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The associated aggregate
guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $25 million
and $7 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters
ended June 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $33 million and $12 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cost of
guarantees was $2.5 million and $0.7 million for the quarters ended June 30,
2015 and 2014, respectively and $3.3 million and $1.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

        The company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio of 7 to 1. The debt
used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and
external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client
and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents,
the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany
investment from IBM.  The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the
company to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing
receivable and are based on arm's-length pricing.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s
external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing
Results of Operations” on page 79 and in “Segment Information” on pages 28 and
29.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of Global Services’ long-term
contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these assets should
be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business
model.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

Looking Forward
 
       Global Financing's financial position provides
flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to be well
positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s assets and new
financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed to the
company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets
are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term
commercial paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A
protracted period where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely
lead to a slowdown in originations.  
 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to changes
in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As previously discussed, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global Financing has policies in
place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies,
combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent
management of the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty
with respect to the global economy.

GAAP
Reconciliation
 
       The tables below provide a reconciliation of the
company’s income statement results as reported under GAAP to its operating
earnings presentation which is a non-GAAP measure. The company’s calculation of
operating (non-GAAP) earnings, as presented, may differ from similarly titled
measures reported by other companies. Please refer to the “Snapshot” section on
page 48 for the company’s rationale for presenting operating earnings
information.
