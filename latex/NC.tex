\begin{abstract}
	Extant accounting literature documents the existance of conditional conservatism in numerical disclosures, i.e. earnings reflecting bad news in a more timely manner than good news. However, little is known about the level of conservatism in narrative disclosure. In this paper, we study whether corporate narrative disclosure is more responsive to bad news than good news. News is proxied by market returns and narrative responsiveness is defined in terms of text content and filing timeliness. Using a sample of 10-Q and 8-K filings automatically retrieved from the SEC EDGAR database, with a time coverage from 1993 to 2020, we find that narrative disclosure is longer, more consistent with news, and timelier in response to bad news comparing to good news, consistent with narrative disclosure being conservative. 
	%[addtional tests and roubustness]% 
	We contribute to the literature on accounting conservatism by providing evidence on asymmetric responsiveness to good news and bad news in narrative disclosure.\\
