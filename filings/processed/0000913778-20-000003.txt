NOTE A - ORGANIZATION

Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund IV L.P. (the "Fund") was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as of October 5, 1993, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes ("Operating Partnerships"). Effective as of June 1, 2001 there was a restructuring and, as a result, the Fund's general partner was reorganized as follows.  The general partner of the Fund continues to be Boston Capital Associates IV L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.  The general partner of the general partner of the Fund is BCA Associates Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, whose sole general partner is C&M Management, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and whose limited partners are Herbert F. Collins and John P. Manning.  Mr. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.  The limited partner of the general partner of the Fund is Capital Investment Holdings, a general partnership whose partners are various officers and employees of Boston Capital Partners, Inc. and its affiliates.  The assignor limited partner is BCTC IV Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is now wholly-owned by John P. Manning. 

Pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the Fund filed a Form S-11 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effective December 16, 1993, which covered the offering (the "Public Offering") of the Fund's beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") representing assignments of units of the beneficial interest of the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner.  The Fund registered 30,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC for sale to the public in one or more series.  On April 18, 1996, an amendment to Form S-11 which registered an additional 10,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.  On April 2, 1998, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 25,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On August 31, 1999, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On July 26, 2000, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On July 24, 2001, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On July 24, 2002, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the public, became effective. On July 1, 2003, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the public, became effective.

NOTE B - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES

The condensed financial statements herein as of December 31, 2019 and for the three and nine months then ended have been prepared by the Fund, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Fund accounts for its investments in Operating Partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership's results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.

The Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include adjustments in interim periods considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to these rules and regulations.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Fund's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

NOTE D - INVESTMENT IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIPS - (continued)
 
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018 the Fund disposed of thirty-seven Operating Partnerships.  A summary of the dispositions by Series for December 31, 2018 is as follows:
 


 
* Fund proceeds from disposition does not include $100, $65,176, $41,294 and $26,082, which was due to a writeoff of capital contribution payable as of December 31, 2018, for Series 29, Series 30, Series 31 and Series 43, respectively.
 
The gain described above is for financial statement purposes only.  There are significant differences between the equity method of accounting and the tax reporting of income and losses from Operating Partnership investments. The largest difference is the ability, for tax purposes, to deduct losses in excess of the Fund's investment in the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the amount of gain recognized for tax purposes may be significantly higher than the gain recorded in the financial statements.

NOTE E - TAXABLE LOSS

The Fund's taxable loss is expected to differ from its loss for financial reporting purposes.  This is primarily due to accounting differences in depreciation incurred by the Operating Partnerships and also differences between the equity method of accounting and the IRS accounting methods.  
 
NOTE F - INCOME TAXES
 
The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.  Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.  The Fund's federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership.  Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.  The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.  Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2015 remain open.
 
NOTE G - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
Events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were available to be issued must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.  The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that existed after the balance sheet date, require disclosure in the accompanying notes.  Management evaluated the activity of the Fund through the date the financial statements were issued, and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Item 2.   Management's Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
 
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.
 
Liquidity

The Fund's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering.  Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 or on working capital reserves, (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund has invested and (iii) proceeds received from the dispositions of the Operating Partnership that are returned to fund reserves.  These sources of liquidity, along with the Fund's working capital reserve, are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership.  The Fund does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships.
 
The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee.  Fund management fees accrued during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 were $340,514 and total fund management fees accrued as of December 31, 2019 were $16,109,004. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, $4,072,277 of the accrued fund management fees were paid. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Fund receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships that will be used to satisfy these liabilities.  The Fund's working capital and sources of liquidity coupled with affiliated party liability accruals allow sufficient levels of liquidity to meet the third party obligations of the Fund.  The Fund is currently unaware of any trends that would create insufficient liquidity to meet future third party obligations of the Fund.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, an affiliate of the general partner of the Fund was paid a total of $235,634 by Series 44 for reimbursements of operating expenses of the Fund previously recorded.

Results of Operations

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Fund held limited partnership interests in 82 and 132 Operating Partnerships, respectively.  In each instance the apartment complex owned by the applicable Operating Partnership is eligible for the federal housing tax credit.  Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as "Qualified Occupancy."  Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable report on Form 8-K.  The general partner of the Fund believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.
 
The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, are as follows:

United Development CO. 2001 LP (Memphis 102) is a 102-unit single family home scattered site development, located in Memphis, TN.  In September 2013, the court-appointed receiver for the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to sell the property to a third-party buyer for $1,173,000; the sale transaction closed on November 26, 2013.  After payment of the outstanding real estate taxes, the remaining proceeds of $210,000 were paid to the first mortgage lender.  There were no cash proceeds to the investment partnership.  The buyer agreed to operate the property in accordance with the land use and regulatory agreement as well as Section 42 of the Tax Code; therefore, resulting in no tax credit recapture or interest penalties for the investment limited partner stemming from the sale.  The investment limited partners will; however, lose federal tax credits in 2013 and 2014 totaling $30,660 and $131,253, respectively, in addition to the recapture in 2012 totaling $281,707, equivalent to $104 per 1,000 BACs.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.

United Development Limited Partnership 2001 (Families First II) is a 66-unit single family house development located in West Memphis, AR.  Due to low occupancy, deferred maintenance, high operating expenses and high debt service, the partnership operates below breakeven.  The operating general partner, whose operating deficit guarantee has expired, provides limited oversight of property operations.  For the most part, it was the third party property management company and the investment general partner who directed property operations starting in January 2014.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 and continuing through October 23, 2015, the investment limited partner had advanced $201,849 from fund reserves to Families First II to finance operating deficits.  No further advances were made by the investment limited partner during the remainder of the fourth quarter of 2015 or during the first half of 2016.  Starting in November 2015, mortgage payments were not made by the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the lender issued a default notice on December 8, 2015, and accelerated payment of the mortgage note.  On February 10, 2016 the court appointed a receiver to manage the property.  The foreclosure on the property occurred on July 21, 2016.  The tax credit recapture costs and interest penalties as a result of the foreclosure sale is estimated at $780,762.  This is equivalent to recapture costs and interest penalties of $289 per 1,000 BACs.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, no gain or loss on the foreclosure of the Operating Partnership has been reported.

Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.  The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund's financial condition and results of operations.  The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.
 
The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.  The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships. The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments.
 
If the book value of the Fund's investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership.
 
The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.  In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments. However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated.
 
In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.  A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates - continued
 
Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.  However, management does not consolidate the Fund's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.  The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Fund's balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.  The Fund's exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.
 
Change in Accounting Principle
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), as amended by subsequent Accounting Standard Updates (collectively, "ASC 606").  The Partnership adopted ASC 606 during 2019 and applied the guidance on a retrospective basis. There was no impact as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 to recognize revenue on the financial statements of the Partnership as of and for the period ended December 31, 2019.
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The Partnership adopted the update on a retrospective basis.  The effect of the adoption was the application of an accounting policy election to classify distributions received from investees using the nature of the distribution approach.  The Partnership classifies distributions from tax credit investments as returns on investment because the design of the project entity is to generate tax credits and losses rather than income from operations.  Application of the accounting policy election had no impact on the presentation in the statement of cash flows in the current or prior reporting periods.
