During the Quarter ended: December 31, 2019:


No equity transactions occurred in the period ended December 31, 2019.


Note 5 – GOING CONCERN


The Company generated minimal revenues prior to the current fiscal year.  No revenues were generated for the nine month period ended December 31, 2019. This level of revenues is not
      sufficient for the Company to meet its future obligations. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


The Company is in the midst of the Dutro litigation and other litigation.  The litigation has hindered the operation of the Company and have set back the ability to raise capital and
      develop ongoing business in order to continue forward as a going concern. It is expected that litigation will continue to hinder the ability to continue as a going concern through the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and beyond.


Note 6 - INCOME TAX


Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are
      recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of
      assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred
      tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


The Company’s financial statements for the nine month period ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 do not include any provision for income taxes.   No income tax accrual has been recorded
      based on the expectation that the Company will be in a net loss position for the overall applicable fiscal year. Accordingly, deferred tax assets have been entirely offset by valuation allowances. The difference between the amounts of income tax
      benefit that would result from applying domestic federal statutory income tax rates to the net loss and the net deferred tax assets is related to certain nondeductible expenses, state income taxes, and the change in the valuation allowance.


The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued ASC 740 for Accounting for Income Taxes that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's
      financial statements. ASC 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a
      company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and
      measurement standards established by ASC 740.


The Company had no unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.


The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for income taxes.  As of December 31, 2019 the
      Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.


The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in the states of Delaware, Utah and any other jurisdiction where required. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
      subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.

Note 7 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


The Company has evaluated subsequent events per the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined that the following events should be disclosed.





Item 2. Management’s Discussion And Analysis Or Plan Of Operation


This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 29a of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
      amended. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. You should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking
      statements, and, when considering such forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors noted in this report, including the section of this report entitled “Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.” You should also keep in
      mind that all forward-looking statements are based on management’s existing beliefs about present and future events outside of management’s control and on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. The following discussion and analysis should be
      read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this report.


Overview


Sector 10 has developed and seeks to market pre-deployed emergency and disaster response equipment with the world’s first patented Stationary Response Units (SRU) and Mobile Response Units (MRU).
      Sector 10 has patents issued in the United States and patent applications pending with U.S. and international agencies. Sector 10’s initial SRU and MRU design has been developed, produced, nationally test marketed and sold.


The Company’s cash balance is insufficient to satisfy the Company’s cash requirements for the next 12 months. Due to issues surrounding Dutro Group and other pending litigation, the ability to
      deliver products to customers has been delayed.  Litigation involving various parties continues and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  The impact of the issues surrounding the litigation impact the Company’s ability to obtain
      funding needed to operate the Company according to their strategic plans.


Going Concern Qualification


Our notes to the financial statements disclose that the cash flow of the Company has been absorbed in operating activities, has incurred net losses for the fiscal year and has a working capital
      deficiency. Due to the pending litigation and the current restructuring, the Company operations are not likely to produce positive cash flow until at least the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about
      our ability to continue as a going concern. Our going concern uncertainty may affect our ability to raise additional capital, and may also affect our relationships with suppliers and customers. Investors should carefully examine our financial
      statements and read the notes to the financial statements.

      results and financial performance may be different from what the Company’s management expects as of the date of this report. The risks described in this report represent the risks that the Company’s management has identified and determined to be
      material to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company’s management, or that the Company’s management currently deems to be immaterial, may also materially harm the Company’s business operations and financial

      pending litigation, the Company operations are not likely to produce positive cash flow until at least the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our going
      concern uncertainty may affect our ability to raise additional capital, and may also affect our relationships with suppliers and customers. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements and read the notes to the financial statements.


Other risk factors to be considered include the following:

•

•


The market for the Company’s stock is thin and subject to manipulation.

The market price for the Common Stock is volatile and may change dramatically at any time.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings


The Company is aware of the following situation regarding litigation, pending or threatened, to which it is a party.


Dutro Group, Dutro Company & Reality Engineering
The Company has filed a claim against the Dutro Group and other defendants to seek relief for the damages incurred by Group’s actions.  The Dutro Group consists of
        Dutro Company, Reality Engineering, William Dutro, Vicki Davis, Lee Allen, Valley Inception, LLC, Incisive Software Corporation and Promixex Corporation.


The Company seeks relief and recovery from the breach of contract and the breakup and transfer by the parties of the technology which ended up with The ADT Corp (“ADT”) / Tyco Corp
      (“TYC”) under the label of “Surveillint”.
The litigation has been ongoing for multiple years and is expected to continue at least into the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and possibly beyond.


In June 2019, the Company became concerned about the various actions by the legal counsel representing them in the litigation (Pia Anderson Moss
        Hoyt).  Based on these concerns, the Company engaged the firm of Clyde Snow and Sessions to assist in reviewing the latest activities and provide guidance on alternatives in which to proceed with the Counsel.


On September 3, 2019, the 3rd District Court in Salt Lake allowed Sector 10’s Counsel (Pia Anderson Moss Hoyt) to withdraw from the case and provided the Company until September 17, 2019 to retain new Counsel by 9/17/2019.  On September 17, 2019, the Company
        formally engaged Dodd & Kuendig of Park City UT as new Counsel in the case.


In October 2019, the Court, set a trial in this matter.   A jury trial is scheduled for 5 days from May 11, 2020 through May 15, 2020.  The
        Company, its Counsel and the defendants met in a Court ordered mediation on February 4, 2020.  No resolution was agreed.  The Company’s Counsel is reviewing various pre-trial legal options and preparing for trial scheduled to begin in May 2020.


Federal and State authorities have and will continue to be updated on the litigation issues and proceedings.
