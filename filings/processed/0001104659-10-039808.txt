Table of Contents
 
Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
and footnotes thereto of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM
or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and
footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the companys management, these
statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature,
necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of operations,
financial position and cash flows. 
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue,
costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are
reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
Actual results may be different. See the companys 2009 Annual Report on pages 52
to 54 for a discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates. 
 
Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the companys 2009 Annual Report.
 
Noncontrolling
interest amounts in income of $1.0 million and $0.4 million, net of tax, for
the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $2.8
million for both the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 are not
presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings due to
immateriality, but are reflected within the other (income) and expense line
item. Additionally, changes to noncontrolling interests are presented in Note
10, Equity Activity, on pages 27 and 28.
 
Within
the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the
use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are
calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is
annotated where applicable. 
 
2. Accounting
Changes: In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued amendments to the disclosure requirements about the credit
quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses. The
purpose of the additional disclosures is to enable users of financial
statements to better understand the nature of credit risk inherent in an entitys
portfolio of financing receivables and how that risk is analyzed. For end of
period balances, the new disclosures are required to be made in all interim and
annual periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. For activity during a
reporting period, the disclosures are required to be made in all interim and
annual periods after January 1, 2011. These changes will not have an
impact on the consolidated financial results as this guidance only relates to
additional disclosures.
 
In
January 2010, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements for fair
value measurements. The guidance requires previous fair value hierarchy
disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities. A class
is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement
of financial position. In addition, significant transfers between Levels 1 and
2 of the fair value hierarchy are required to be disclosed. These additional
requirements became effective January 1, 2010 for quarterly and annual
reporting. These amendments did not have an impact on the consolidated
financial results as this guidance relates only to additional disclosures. See
Note 4, Fair Value, on pages 11 to 13 for further information. In
addition, the fair value disclosure amendments also require more detailed
disclosures of the changes in Level 3 instruments. These changes will be
effective January 1, 2011 and will not have an impact on the consolidated
financial results as this guidance only relates to additional disclosures.
 
In
October 2009, the FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance for
arrangements with multiple deliverables. The new guidance requires the use of
managements best estimate of selling price (BESP) for the deliverables in an
arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), vendor objective
evidence (VOE) or third party evidence (TPE) of the selling price is not
available. In addition, excluding specific software revenue guidance, the residual
method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted, and an
entity is required to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative
selling price method. In accordance with the guidance, the company elected to
early adopt its provisions as of January 1, 2010 on a prospective basis
for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after that
date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Also,
in October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which amended the scope of
existing software revenue recognition guidance. Tangible products containing
software components and non-software components that function together to
deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the
scope of software revenue guidance and are accounted for based on other
applicable revenue recognition guidance. In addition, the amendments require
that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components
are always excluded from the software revenue guidance. This guidance must be
adopted in the same period that the company adopts the amended guidance for
arrangements with multiple

Statements  (continued)
 
deliverables
described in the preceding paragraph. Therefore, the company elected to early
adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2010 on a prospective basis for all
new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after that date. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
See
Note 3, Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, on pages 8
to 11 for the required disclosures and other information related to the
adoption of these accounting standards.
 
In
June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting rules for
variable interest entities (VIEs). The new guidance eliminates the quantitative
approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of
whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. The company adopted these
amendments for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1,
2010. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
3. Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables: As discussed in Note 2, Accounting
Changes, on page 7, effective January 1, 2010 the company adopted on
a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered
into on or after that date the amended accounting guidance for
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and the amended guidance related to
the scope of existing software revenue recognition guidance. The amended
guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for the companys revenue
transactions. Most of the companys products and services qualify as separate
units of accounting.
 
The
company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple
deliverables of its products and services based on the needs of its clients.
These arrangements may include any combination of services, software, hardware
and/or financing. For example, a client may purchase a server that includes
operating system software. In addition, the arrangement may include
post-contract support for the software and a contract for post-warranty
maintenance service for the hardware. These types of arrangements can also
include financing provided by the company. These arrangements consist of
multiple deliverables, with the hardware and software delivered in one
reporting period and the software support and hardware maintenance services
delivered across multiple reporting periods. In another example, a client may
outsource the running of its datacenter operations to the company on a long
term, multiple year basis and periodically purchase servers and/or software
products from the company to upgrade or expand its facility. The outsourcing
services are provided on a continuous basis across multiple reporting periods
and the hardware and software products are delivered in one reporting period.
To the extent that a deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement is
subject to specific guidance that deliverable is accounted for in accordance
with such specific guidance. Examples of such arrangements may include leased
hardware which is subject to specific leasing guidance or software which is
subject to specific software revenue recognition guidance on whether and/or how
to separate multiple deliverable arrangements into separate units of accounting
(separability) and how to allocate the arrangement consideration among those
separate units of accounting (allocation). For all other deliverables in
multiple-deliverable arrangements, the guidance below is applied for
separability and allocation. A multiple-deliverable arrangement is separated
into more than one unit of accounting if the following criteria are met:
 
·                      The delivered
item(s) has value to the client on a stand-alone basis; and
·                      If the
arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered
item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered
probable and substantially in the control of the company.
 
If these criteria are not met, the arrangement is
accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being
recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier
of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is
delivered. If these criteria are met for each element and there is a relative
selling price for all units of accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement
consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each
units relative selling price. The revenue recognition policies described below
are then applied to each unit of accounting, as applicable.
 
Services
 
The
companys primary services offerings include information technology (IT)
datacenter and business process outsourcing, application management services,
consulting and systems integration, technology infrastructure and system maintenance,
Web hosting and the design and development of complex IT systems to a clients
specifications (design and build). These services are provided on a
time-and-material basis, as a fixed-price contract or as a fixed-price per
measure of output contract and the contract terms range from less than one year
to over 10 years.

Revenue
from IT datacenter and business process outsourcing contracts is recognized in
the period the services are provided using either an objective measure of
output or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Under the output
method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on the services delivered in
the period.
 
Revenue
from application management services, technology infrastructure and system
maintenance and Web hosting contracts is primarily recognized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the contracts. Revenue from time-and-material contracts
is recognized as labor hours are delivered and direct expenses are incurred.
Revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period.
 
Revenue
from fixed-price design and build contracts is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion (POC) method.  Under the POC method, revenue
is recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the
total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract. If circumstances arise
that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress
toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may
result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such
revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
gave rise to the revision become known by management.
 
Hardware
 
The companys hardware offerings include the sale or
lease of system servers, storage solutions, retail store systems and the sale
of semiconductor design and manufacturing services. The company provides
warranties for its hardware products that range up to three years, with the
majority being either one year or three years. The company also offers
installation services for its more complex products.
 
Revenue from hardware sales and sales-type leases is
recognized when risk of loss has transferred to the client and there are no
unfulfilled company obligations that affect the clients final acceptance of
the arrangement. Any cost of standard warranties and remaining obligations that
are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue
is recognized. Revenue from extended warranty contracts, for which the company
is obligated to perform, is recorded as deferred income and subsequently
recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period. Revenue from
rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term
of the rental or lease.
 
Software
 
Revenue from perpetual (one-time charge) license
software is recognized at the inception of the license term if all revenue
recognition criteria have been met. Revenue from term (recurring license
charge) license software is recognized on a subscription basis over the period
that the client is entitled to use the license. Revenue from subscription and
support, which includes unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period such items are
delivered. In multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements that include software
that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole (software
multiple-deliverable arrangements), software and software-related elements are
accounted for in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance.
Software-related elements include software products and services for which a
software deliverable is essential to its functionality. Tangible products
containing software components and non-software components that function
together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no
longer within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and are
accounted for based on other applicable revenue recognition guidance.
 
A software multiple-deliverable arrangement is
separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following
criteria are met:
 
·                      The
functionality of the delivered element(s) is not dependent on the
undelivered element(s);
 
·                      There is VSOE
of fair value of the undelivered element(s). VSOE of fair value is based on the
price charged when the deliverable is sold separately by the company on a
regular basis and not as part of the multiple-deliverable arrangement; and
 
·                      Delivery of the
delivered element(s) represents the culmination of the earnings process
for that element(s).
 
If
any one of these criteria are not met, the arrangement is accounted for as one
unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized on a
straight-line basis or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria
are met or when the
 
9

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
last
undelivered element is delivered. If these criteria are met for each element
and there is VSOE of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement,
the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting
based on each units relative VSOE of fair value. There may be cases, however,
in which there is VSOE of fair value of the undelivered item(s) but no
such evidence for the delivered item(s). In these cases, the residual method is
used to allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the
amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item(s) equals the
total arrangement consideration less the aggregate VSOE of fair value of the
undelivered elements.
 
The companys
multiple-deliverable arrangements may have a stand-alone software deliverable
that is subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance. The
revenue for these multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to the
software deliverable and the non-software deliverables based on the relative
selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the
hierarchy (VSOE, TPE or BESP) in the new amended revenue accounting guidance.
In the limited circumstances where the company cannot determine VSOE or TPE of
the selling price for all of the deliverables in the arrangement, including the
software deliverable, BESP is used for the purposes of performing this
allocation.
 
Financing
 
Financing income
attributable to sales-type leases, direct financing leases and loans is
recognized on the accrual basis using the effective interest method. Operating
lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 
Determination of Best Estimate of
Selling Price
 
In certain limited
instances, the company is not able to establish VSOE for all elements in a
multiple deliverable arrangement. When VSOE cannot be established, the company
attempts to establish the selling price of each element based on TPE. TPE is
determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold
separately.
 
When the company is unable to establish selling price
using VSOE or TPE, the company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement
consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the
company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a
stand-alone basis. Due to the fact that the company sells its products and
services on a stand-alone basis, and therefore has established VSOE for its
products and services offerings, the company expects to use BESP to determine
the relative selling price for a product or service in a multiple-deliverable
arrangement on an infrequent basis. An example of when BESP would be used is
when the company sells a new product, for which VSOE and TPE does not exist, in
a multiple deliverable arrangement prior to selling the new product on a
stand-alone basis. During the second quarter and six month period ended June 30,
2010, BESP was used in seven and nine transactions, respectively, and the
effects of its use were immaterial.
 
The company determines BESP
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not
limited to, overall market conditions, including geographic or regional
specific market factors, competitive positioning, competitor actions, internal
costs, profit objectives and pricing practices. The determination of BESP is a
formal process within the company that includes review and approval by the
companys management. In addition, the company regularly reviews VSOE and TPE
for its products and services, in addition to BESP.
 
Effect of Adoption
 
For transactions entered
into prior to January 1, 2010, the company recognized revenue based on
established revenue recognition guidance as it related to the elements within
the arrangement. For the vast majority of the companys arrangements involving
multiple deliverables, the fee from the arrangement was allocated to each
respective element based on its relative fair value, using VSOE. In the limited
circumstances when the company was not able to determine VSOE for all of the
elements of the arrangement, but was able to obtain VSOE for any undelivered
elements, revenue was allocated using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equaled the total
arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered
elements, and no revenue was recognized until all elements without VSOE had
been delivered. If VSOE of any undelivered items did not exist, revenue from
the entire arrangement was initially deferred and recognized at the earlier of:
(i) delivery of those elements for which VSOE did not exist or
(ii) when VSOE was established. The residual method and recognition of
revenue on a ratable basis were generally used in circumstances where VSOE, as
applicable, was unavailable.
 
The new amended accounting
standards for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and changes to the
scope of existing software revenue recognition guidance if applied to
transactions in the year ended December 31, 2009 would not have resulted
in a material change to the companys reported revenue for that fiscal year
period.
 
10





Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
In addition, there would not
have been a material impact to revenue, as reported during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2010, if the transactions entered into or materially
modified on or after January 1, 2010 were subject to the previous
accounting guidance.
 
As discussed in Note 2, Accounting
Changes, on pages 7 and 8 there was no material impact in the second
quarter or the first six months of 2010, respectively, from the adoption of the
amended revenue recognition guidance. In terms of the timing and pattern of
revenue recognition, the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition is not
expected to have a material impact on revenue in future periods.
 
See
the companys 2009 Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on
pages 70 and 71 and Critical Accounting Estimates, on pages 52 and
53 for additional information.
 
4. Fair
Value: Exit prices are used to measure assets and
liabilities that fall within the scope of the fair value measurements guidance.
Under this guidance, the company is required to classify certain assets and liabilities
based on the following fair value hierarchy:
 
·                   Level 1Quoted prices in active markets that
are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities;
·                   Level 2Quoted prices for identical assets
and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which
significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
·                   Level 3Prices or valuations that require
inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
 
The
guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available
without undue cost and effort.
 
When
available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair
value and classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
The
determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate
yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For
derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow
analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
In
determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers
certain market valuation adjustments to the base valuations calculated using
the methodologies described below for several parameters that market
participants would consider in determining fair value:
 
·                   Counterparty credit risk adjustments are
applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of
a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the
true fair value of such an instrument.
·                   Credit risk adjustments are applied to
reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at
fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing
counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit
risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
As
an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived by a discounted cash flow
model using observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts,
yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These
inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which
are available for the full term of the derivative.
 
Certain
financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These
assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair value at
the end of the period to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
These assets include public cost method investments that are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary
impairment of a financial investment, fair value is measured using a model
described above.
 
11





Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
Non-financial
assets such as property plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible
assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are
deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets
depend on the type of asset. See Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 70
to 79 in the 2009 Annual Report for further information. There were no material
impairments of non-financial assets for the six months ended June 30, 2010
and June 30, 2009.
 
The
following tables present the companys financial assets and financial
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009.

5. Financial Instruments (excluding derivatives): Cash and cash
equivalents, debt and marketable equity securities are recognized and measured
at fair value in the companys consolidated financial statements. Notes and
other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with
carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued
expenses and short-term debt are financial liabilities with carrying values
that approximate fair value. In the absence of quoted prices in active markets,
considerable judgment is required in developing estimates of fair value.
Estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could
realize in a current market transaction. The following methods and assumptions
are used to estimate fair values:
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
Fair
values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered
for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining
maturities.
 
Long-term Debt
 
Fair
value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for
the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other
long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected
present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value.
The carrying amount of long-term debt is $21,017 million and $21,932 million
and the estimated fair value is $22,612 million and $23,748 million at June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Based
on an evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2010, the company
believes that unrealized losses on debt and marketable equity securities are
temporary and do not represent a need for an other-than-temporary impairment.
 
Proceeds
from sales of debt securities and marketable equity securities were
approximately $4 million and $13 million for the second quarter and first six
months of 2010, respectively. The gross realized gains (before taxes) on these
sales totaled $1 million and $5 million for the second quarter and first six
months of 2010, respectively. The gross realized losses (before taxes) on these
sales were less than $1 million in the second quarter and first six months of
2010. Proceeds from the sales of debt securities and marketable equity
securities were approximately $6 million and $11 million in the second quarter
and first six months of 2009, respectively. The gross realized losses (before
taxes) on these sales totaled $12 million and $21 million in the second quarter
and first six months of 2009, respectively. The company determines the cost of
the securities sold based on the specific identification method.
 
The
after tax net unrealized holding gains/(losses) on available-for-sale debt and
marketable equity securities that have been included in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) and the after tax net gains/(losses) reclassified
from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into net income were as

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing
leases is for leases that relate principally to the companys systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$794 million and $849 million at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of $779 million and $905
million and of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of $149 million and
$159 million at those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to
inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM
and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable
financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables are loans that are provided by
Global Financing primarily to clients to finance the purchase of  software and services. Separate contractual
relationships on these financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally
from two to seven years. Each financing contract is priced independently at
competitive market rates. The company has a history of enforcing the terms of
these separate financing agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing
receivables as collateral for non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables
pledged as collateral for borrowings were $264 million and $271 million at June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009.
 
7. Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions: The company operates in multiple functional
currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In
the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest
rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity
and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these
risks by following established risk management policies and procedures,
including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with
debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate
exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the
interest rates associated with the companys lease and other financial assets
and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also
used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures,
derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from
foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of
derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties
to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To
mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy of only
entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions
based upon their credit ratings and other factors. The companys established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The

right of set-off that exists
under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company
subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default. The company
is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its major
counterparties.  These arrangements
require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury
securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established
thresholds. Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default
swap pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The
aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized
arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009 was $173 million and $779 million, respectively, for which the company has
posted collateral of $0 million and $37 million, respectively. Full  collateralization of these agreements would
be required in the event that the companys credit rating falls below
investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points,
as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate
fair value of derivative instruments in net asset positions as of June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009 was $2,162 million and $838 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date as a result of the counterparties failing to perform as
contracted. This exposure is reduced by $438 million and $573 million at June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, of liabilities included in
master netting arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at June 30,
2010, this exposure is reduced by $661 million of collateral received by the
company. The company
does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting
arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment
or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative
instruments. At June 30, 2010, there were no amounts recognized in other
receivables for the right to reclaim cash collateral. At December 31,
2009, $37 million was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets for
the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amounts recognized in accounts
payable for the obligation to return cash collateral totaled $661 million at June 30,
2010. The company had no obligation to return cash collateral at December 31,
2009. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to
rehypothecation and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. At June 30,
2010, no collateral was rehypothecated.
 
The company may employ
derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders equity
resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign
subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments,
designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as
the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not
offset by a cash flow from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The
company monitors the cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may
discontinue some of these hedging relationships by de-designating the
derivative instrument to manage this liquidity risk. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in
fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation
until maturity.
 
In its hedging programs, the
company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and cross-currency
swaps, depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to
leveraged derivative instruments.
 
A brief description of the
major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate
Borrowings
 
The company issues debt in
the global capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan
portfolio. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate
mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce
overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges). At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total
notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps was $7.5 billion and $9.1
billion, respectively.
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to
interest rate volatility on forecasted debt issuances. To manage this risk, the
company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the
interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009.

Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign
Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
A large portion of the
companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge
of net investment to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major
foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses
cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk
management purpose. At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total
notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges
was $2.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining
maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009
was approximately 0.6 years and 1.6 years, respectively.
 
In
addition, at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the company had
liabilities of $289 million and $318 million, respectively, representing the
fair value of derivative instruments that were previously designated in
qualifying net investment hedging relationships but were de-designated prior to
June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively; of these amounts
$170 million and $94 million are expected to mature over the next twelve
months, respectively. The notional amount of these instruments at June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009 was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion,
respectively, including original and offsetting transactions.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost
Transactions
 
The companys operations
generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these
foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency
markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to
manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years.
At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total notional amount of
forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost
transactions was $16.6 billion and $18.7 billion, with a weighted-average
remaining maturity of 1.1 years and 1.3 years, respectively.
 
Foreign Currency Denominated
Borrowings
 
The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to
convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt
denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the
company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is
approximately 3.5 years. At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of
foreign currency denominated debt was $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion,
respectively.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign
Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its Global
Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers
principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner.
In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to
economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion
of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of
these forward and swap contracts are generally less than two years. The changes
in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures
are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of
foreign currency exposure was $13.1 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively.

Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to
market price changes primarily related to certain obligations to employees.
These exposures are primarily related to market price movements in certain
broad market indices and in the companys own stock. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes
derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the
exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are
linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return
on the companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value with gains or
losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total notional
amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation
obligations was $0.8 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
The company holds warrants
to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that
are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement
provisions. The amount of shares to be purchased under these agreements was
immaterial at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The company
records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The company is exposed to a
potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The
company utilizes credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit
exposures. These derivatives have terms of one year or less. The swaps are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any
derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009.
 
The following tables provide
a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument related
risk management activity as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 as
well as for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009,
respectively:

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
At
June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, in connection with cash flow hedges
of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains
of $817 million and net losses $402 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts $450
million of gains and $182 million of losses, respectively, are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next twelve months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. At June 30,
2010 and June 30, 2009, net losses of approximately $17 million and net
losses of approximately $16 million (before taxes), respectively, were recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in connection with cash flow
hedges of the companys borrowings. Within these amounts $9 million and $6
million of losses, respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net income
within the next twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact against
the underlying transactions.
 
For
the six months ending June 30, 2010, and June 30, 2009, there were no
significant gains or losses recognized in earnings representing hedge
ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (for
fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying exposure that did not or
was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor are there any anticipated
in the normal course of business.
 
During
July 2010, the company unwound certain of its multi-year cash flow hedges
(approximately $3.7 billion notional amount), resulting in a cash inflow of
$257 million which will be reflected in the companys third quarter operating
cash flows. This gain will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) to net income over a multi-year period consistent with the
original maturity dates of these hedges.
 
Refer
to the 2009 IBM Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies on pages 76
and 77 for additional information on the companys use of derivative
instruments.
 
8. Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based
compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service period.  The following table presents total
stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings:

* Reflects the one-time
effects of the sale of the Product Lifecycle Management activities.
 
The
increase in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended June 30,
2010, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was
principally the result of an increase related to restricted and
performance-based stock units ($18 million). The increase in pre-tax
stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2010, as
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was principally the
result of an increase related to restricted and performance-based stock units
($67 million), partially offset by a reduction in the level of stock option
grants ($16 million).
 
As
of June 30, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,257
million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
 
There
were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at June 30,
2010 and 2009.
 
9. Segments:  The following tables reflect the results of
operations of the segments consistent with the companys management and
measurement system.  These results are
not necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP. Performance
measurement is based on pre-tax income. These results are used, in part, by
senior management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating
resources to, each of the segments.

The company received a $12.1
million subsidy in the second quarter of 2010 and a $21.1 million subsidy for
the first half of 2010 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by the company
to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the remainder is
contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the participants.
For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 121
in the companys 2009 Annual Report.
 
12. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
Acquisitions: During the six
months ended June 30, 2010, the company completed six acquisitions at an
aggregate cost of $1,176 million.
 
The
Software segment completed acquisitions of four privately held companies: in
the first quarter, Lombardi Software, Inc., Intelliden Inc. and
Initiate Systems, Inc.; and in the second quarter, Cast Iron Systems.  Global Technology Services (GTS) completed
one acquisition in the first quarter: 
the core operating assets of Wilshire Credit Corporation.  Global Business Services (GBS) completed one
acquisition in the first quarter: 
National Interest Security Company, LLC, a privately held company.
 
Each
acquisition further complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of
product and services offerings.  Lombardi is a leading provider of
business process management software and services and will become part of the
companys application integration software portfolio. Intelliden is a leading
provider of intelligent network automation software and will extend the companys
network management offerings. Initiate is a market leader in data integrity
software for information sharing among health care and government
organizations. Cast Iron Systems, the leading Software as a Service (SaaS) and
cloud application integration provider, enhances the companys industry-leading
WebSphere business integration software portfolio. Wilshires mortgage
servicing platform will continue the companys strategic focus on the mortgage
services industry and strengthens its commitment to deliver mortgage business
process outsourcing solutions.  National Interest Security Company will
strengthen the companys ability to deliver advanced analytics and IT solutions
to the public sector. Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions was
paid in cash. All acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
The
table below reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the
resulting purchase price allocations as of June 30, 2010:

Notes

The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entities were recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life
of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 5.1 years.  With the exception of goodwill, these
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Goodwill of $855 million has been assigned to the Software
($571 million), GTS ($32 million) and GBS ($252 million) segments. It is
expected that approximately 25 percent of the goodwill will be deductible for
tax purposes.
 
On May 24, 2010, the company announced that
it has agreed to acquire business-to-business software and services company
Sterling Commerce from AT&T, Inc. for approximately $1.4 billion in
cash. This acquisition, which is expected to close in the second half of 2010,
will give the company new capabilities to help clients build dynamic networks
that connect software across different servers.
 
On June 15, 2010, the company announced a
definitive agreement to acquire Coremetrics, a leader in web analytics
software. Coremetrics, a privately held company based in San Mateo, California,
will expand the companys business analytics capabilities by enabling
organizations to use a cloud-based delivery model to gain real-time insight
into consumer interactions internally and through social media networks to
develop faster, more targeted marketing campaigns. This acquisition is expected
to close in the third quarter of 2010.
 
On July 1, 2010, the company announced it
entered into an agreement to acquire BigFix, Inc., a privately-held
company based in Emeryville, California. The move aims to accelerate the
companys efforts to help organizations more intelligently secure the
enterprise by managing and automating security and compliance updates on
thousands of computers globally. This transaction closed on July 19, 2010.
At the date of issuance of these financial statements, the initial purchase
accounting was not complete.
 
Divestitures: On
March 31, 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities
associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes (Dassault) product
lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related
assets to Dassault. The company received net proceeds of $459 million and
recognized a net gain of $591 million on the transaction in the first quarter
of 2010. The gain was net of the fair value of certain contractual terms,
certain transaction costs and the assets and liabilities sold. The gain was
recorded in other (income) and expense on the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings and the net proceeds are reflected in proceeds from disposition of
marketable securities and other investments within cash flow from investing
activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
 
On
March 16, 2009, the company completed the sale of certain processes,
resources, assets and third-party contracts related to its core logistics
operations to Geodis.  The company
received cash proceeds of $365 million and recognized a net gain of $298
million on the transaction in the first quarter of 2009.  The gain was net of the fair value of certain
contractual terms, certain transaction costs and related real estate
charges.  As part of this transaction,
the company outsourced its logistics operations to Geodis which will enable the
company to leverage industry-leading skills and scale and improve the
productivity of the companys supply chain.
 
In 2007, the company
divested 51 percent of its printing business (InfoPrint) to Ricoh.  The company also stated that it would divest
its remaining ownership to Ricoh quarterly over a three year period from the
closing date.  At June 30, 2010, the
company no longer has an ownership interest in InfoPrint.  See the companys 2009 Annual Report on
pages 85 and 86 for additional information.

(a)               Other intangibles are primarily acquired
proprietary and non-proprietary business processes, methodologies and systems.
 
The net carrying amount of
intangible assets increased $13 million during the first half of 2010,
primarily due to acquired intangible asset additions, partially offset by
amortization.  The aggregate intangible
amortization expense was $284 million and $570 million for the second quarter
and first six months of 2010 respectively, versus $307 million and $618 million
for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2009,
respectively.  In addition, in the first
half of 2010, the company retired $692 million of fully amortized intangible
assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization
by this amount.
 
The amortization expense for
each of the five succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be
the following at June 30, 2010:

15. Contingencies:  As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 170 countries, IBM
is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims,
demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from
time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in
the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to
be subject to claims challenging its intellectual property (IP) rights and
associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent
infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition,
the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license
negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBMs
scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various
jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including
matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the companys pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These
actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, partners, clients, current or former employees, government and
regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which
the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party
may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise
novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these
matters arise.
 
The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.

The company is a defendant
in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City, Utah
by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to Federal Court in
Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of AT&Ts UNIX
IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair competition, interference
with contract and breach of contract with regard to the companys distribution
of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux. The company has asserted
counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation of the Lanham Act,
unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive trade practices,
breach of the General Public License that governs open source distributions,
promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. Motions for summary judgment
were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its decision.
On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all
proceedings in this case were stayed. On August 25, 2009, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved the appointment of a
Chapter 11 Trustee of SCO. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc.
v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010. The jury found that
Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights; the judge subsequently
ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims
against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. In July 2010, SCO filed an appeal in connection with this matter.
 
On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform
Solutions, Inc. (PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, alleging that PSI violated certain intellectual property
rights of IBM. PSI asserted counterclaims against IBM. On January 11,
2008, the court permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems,
to intervene as a counterclaim-plaintiff. T3 claimed that IBM violated certain
antitrust laws by refusing to license its patents and trade secrets to PSI and
by tying the sales of its mainframe computers to its mainframe operating
systems. On June 30, 2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a result of this
transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed all claims against each other, and PSI
withdrew a complaint it had filed with the European Commission in
October 2007 with regard to IBM. On September 30, 2009, the court
granted IBMs motion for summary judgment and dismissed T3s claims against
IBM. This decision has been appealed by T3. In January 2009, T3 filed a
complaint with the European Commission alleging that IBM violated European
Union competition law based on the facts alleged in the above-referenced U.S.
litigation involving T3. In March 2010, TurboHercules SAS filed a
similar complaint with the European Commission. IBM has been notified that
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating possible antitrust
violations by IBM, and the DOJ has requested certain information, including the
production of materials from the litigation between T3 and IBM. In July 2010,
the European Commission notified the company that it has decided to initiate
proceedings to further investigate IBM regarding possible infringements of
European Union competition law.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on December 14, 2009 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by Neon
Enterprise Software, LLC. Neon alleges that the company has interfered with
Neons efforts to license its zPrime software. It seeks damages and injunctive
relief. In late January 2010, IBM filed its answer to Neons
complaint and asserted counterclaims against Neon. The case is set for trial in
March 2012.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on April 2, 2009 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by Acqis LLC, which alleges
that certain IBM products infringe certain patents relating generally to
modular computing devices. Acqis seeks damages and injunctive relief. The case
is set for trial in February 2011.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on February 5, 2010 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by TecSec, Inc.,
which alleges that certain IBM products infringe certain patents relating
generally to encryption. TecSec seeks damages and injunctive relief. A pretrial
conference is scheduled for November 2010.
 
In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea
announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several
companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and
LG electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and
had also charged employees of some of those entities with, among other things,
bribery of certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea and bid
rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in these
matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM
employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM
were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different
times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance,
which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have both contacted the company in
connection with this matter. In March 2008, the company received a request
from the SEC for additional information.

The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in
the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages
in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.
 
The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters include claims for taxes on the importation
of computer software. In November 2008, the company won a significant case
in the Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil, and
in late July 2009, the company received written confirmation regarding
this decision. The total potential amount related to the remaining matters for
all applicable years is approximately $600 million. The company believes it
will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful
indicator of liability.
 
The
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are
reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the
impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other
information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities,
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30,
2010, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its
experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters
previously referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential
liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters
previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously,
it is possible that the companys business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the
resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on the
Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of
the particular matter which may give rise to additional factors.
 
16. Commitments: The companys
extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of
$3,487 million and $3,576 million at June 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $2,637 million and $2,788
million at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 
The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following
is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
The company is a party to a
variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the
other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise
in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the
company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising
from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title
to the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights,
 
35





Table of

specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the
company to challenge the other partys claims. While typically indemnification
provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the companys payment, the companys
obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or
nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against
third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had
a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.
 
In addition, the company
guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential
future payment under these financial guarantees was $82 million and $85 million
at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The fair value
of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position was not material.

* 1.6 percent adjusted for currency
 
Within
the Management Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at
constant currency are made so that certain financial results can be viewed
without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby
facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial
results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period
activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency
conversion rate. This approach is based on the pricing currency for each
country, which is typically the functional currency.
 
In
the second quarter of 2010, the company continued the trend of improving
business performance, increasing constant currency revenue growth, expanding
margins and again delivering double-digit earnings per share growth.
 
The
company has increased earnings per share in each of the last 30 quarters. Since
early 2007, when the company first introduced its 2010 roadmap, the company has
delivered double-digit earnings per share growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters.
In each of these quarterly periods - which spanned a variety of economic
environments - the company has faced unique opportunities and challenges. The
many dimensions of the companys business model - business mix, global scale and
structure, financial strength and flexibility - have enabled the company to
overcome the challenges and capitalize on opportunities - and consistently
deliver solid performance. In the second quarter, the company faced a
significant currency impact driven by the sharp strengthening of the dollar and
still delivered 13 percent earnings per share growth compared to a very strong
second quarter of 2009 in which earnings per share increased 18 percent.
 
Total
revenue increased 2.0 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the
second quarter of 2009. Overall, currency provided approximately 40 basis
points of revenue growth versus the 200-300 basis points projected based on
mid-April spot rates at the time the company released its first quarter
financial results. That resulted in a 2-3 point impact to the companys as
reported revenue growth. The revenue growth rate at constant currency was 2
points better than the constant currency performance in the first quarter of
2010 and 7 points better than the fourth quarter of 2009 growth rate. The first
quarter 2010 sale of the companys Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software
activities impacted the second quarter revenue growth rate by approximately one
point. On this basis, the improvement was broad based - across all the companys
segments and geographies.
 
Revenue
performance was strong in the companys key growth investment areas. Total
revenue from the growth markets increased 13.7 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) with performance driven by the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India
and China, which increased 21.9 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency) as
the company has been investing heavily to build out the infrastructures in the
emerging countries. The company is investing to extend its technology
leadership.

Management Discussion 
(continued)
 
Earlier
this year, Power7 technology was introduced to the companys mid-range Unix
servers - in the second quarter, the mid-range grew 11 percent which drove
share gains in Power Systems. In the third quarter, the company will have
Power7 across its entire Unix product line and will introduce and begin
shipping its next generation mainframe server. Business analytics is a key
growth area for the company. In the second quarter, business analytics revenue
increased 14 percent compared to the prior year which contributed to strong
performance in the Software and Global Business Services segments. Global
Business Services revenue growth improved to 3.3 percent (3 percent adjusted
for currency) and key branded middleware in Software increased 9.4 percent (10
percent adjusted for currency) versus the prior year and gained share again in
the quarter.
 
The
consolidated gross profit margin increased 0.1 point versus the second quarter
of 2009 to 45.6 percent driven by improved margins in Global Business Services
and Software. Gross profit margin performance by segment and the impact to the
consolidated gross margin was as follows:

Pre-tax income grew 7.3
percent and the pre-tax margin was 19.3 percent, an increase of 1.0 point
versus the second quarter of 2009. Net income increased 9.1 percent reflecting
an improvement in the tax rate. The effective tax rate was 26.0 percent,
compared with 27.2 percent in the prior year. Net income margin improved 0.9
points to 14.3 percent.
 
Diluted earnings per share
improved 12.5 percent reflecting the growth in net income and the benefits of
the common stock repurchase program. In the second quarter, the company
repurchased 32.4 million shares of its common stock. Diluted earnings per share
of $2.61 increased $0.29 from the prior year driven by the following factors:
 



- Revenue increase at
  actual rates:


 


$0.05


 


 


 




- Operating leverage:

$0.04


 


 


 




-
  Common stock repurchases:


 


$0.08


 


 


 



 
In the second quarter, the
improvement in earnings per share was driven by a combination of revenue
growth, margin expansion and an effective use of cash.
 
The company generated $3,766
million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $975
million compared to the second quarter of 2009, driven primarily by financing
receivables ($648 million) and a prior year foreign tax refund ($360 million).
Net cash used in investing activities of $1,946 million increased $97 million
primarily due to increased capital investments ($106 million). Net cash used in
financing activities of $3,746 million was essentially flat compared to the
prior year.
 
Total Global Services
signings of $12,299 million were flat versus the first quarter and down 12.1
percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the second quarter of
2009. Signings performance was impacted by a decline in outsourcing signings of
19 percent (19 percent adjusted for currency) compared to a very strong prior
year period. Based on an assessment of the larger outsourcing contracts, there
was a significant decline in contract extensions as a number of large deals
pushed out of the second quarter. Contract extensions have little to no benefit
to near-term revenue. In contrast, the business had good growth in new business
signings which will have a more immediate contribution to revenue.The Global Services
backlog at June 30, 2010 was $129 billion, a decrease of $2 billion (up $1

In the first half of 2010, the company delivered
excellent financial performance with diluted earnings per share of $4.57, an
increase of 13.7 percent compared to the first six months of 2009. Performance
was consistent with earnings per share growth of 15.9 percent in the first
quarter and 12.5 percent in the second quarter. The company continues to
demonstrate steady improvement in the business - in both revenue growth and
margin expansion. The company utilizes its strong profit and cash position to
invest and expand its base of opportunity while returning capital to its
shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.
 
Total revenue increased 3.6 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency) compared to the first half of 2009. Revenue performance
in the companys key growth areas was strong. Revenue from the growth markets
increased 16.6 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) driven by the BRIC
countries which increased 22.4 percent (15 percent adjusted for currency). Key
branded middleware software increased 11.1 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency). On a segment basis, Global Technology Services revenue increased 3.8
percent (flat adjusted for currency), Global Business Services 1.8 percent
(down 1 percent adjusted for currency), Software 6.1 percent (4 percent
adjusted for currency) and Systems and Technology 4.1 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency). Global Financing revenue declined 5.6 percent (9 percent
adjusted for currency) versus the prior year.
 
The consolidated gross profit margin increased 0.1
point versus the first half of 2009 to 44.6 percent. Gross profit margin
performance by segment and the impact to the consolidated gross margin for the

Pre-tax income grew 9.6
percent and the pre-tax margin was 17.4 percent, an increase of 0.9 points
versus the first half of 2009. Net income increased 10.9 percent reflecting an
improvement in the tax rate. The effective tax rate was 26.0 percent, compared
with 26.9 percent in the prior year. Net income margin improved 0.8 points to
12.9 percent.
 
Diluted earnings per share
improved 13.7 percent reflecting the growth in net income and the benefits of
the common stock repurchase program. In the first half, the company repurchased
64.6 million shares of its common stock. Diluted earnings per share of $4.57
increased $0.55 from the prior year driven by the following factors :
 



- Revenue increase at
  actual rates:


 


$0.14


 


 


 




- Operating leverage:


 


$0.29


 


 


 




 


·


Gross margin increase of
  0.1 point:  


 


$0.04


 


 


 




 


·


Expense productivity:


 


$0.20


 


 


 




 


·


Tax rate decrease of 0.9
  points:   


 


$0.05


 


 


 




- Common stock repurchases:  


 


$0.12


 


 


 



 
In
the first half, the improvement in earnings per share was balanced with
contribution from all the key drivers - revenue growth, margin expansion and an
effective use of cash.
 
At June 30, 2010, the
companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong and are
well-positioned to support the companys objectives. Key drivers in the balance
sheet and total cash flows are highlighted below.
 
Total assets decreased
$5,602 million ($2,135 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009 driven by:
 
·                  Decreases in
total receivables ($4,761 million), cash and marketable securities ($1,732
million) and plant, rentals & other property ($631 million), partially
offset by;
·                  Increased
pension assets ($573 million), investments and sundry assets ($659 million) and
goodwill ($354 million).
 
The company had $12,241
million in cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2010.
 
Total liabilities decreased
$4,023 million ($1,341 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009 driven by:
 
·                  Decreases in
other liabilities ($1,207 million), taxes ($931million) and pension and retiree
benefits ($1,355 million), partially offset by;
·                  Increased debt
($551 million).
 
Total equity of $21,176
million decreased $1,579 million from December 31, 2009 as a result of:
 
·                  Increased
treasury stock ($8,033 million) and lower foreign currency translation
adjustments ($1,081 million), partially offset by;
·                  Higher retained
earnings ($4,423 million), common stock ($1,712 million), gains on cash flow
hedge derivatives ($1,015 million) and lower pension adjustments ($392
million).
 
The company generated $8,203
million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $924
million, compared to the first six months of 2009, primarily driven by
financing receivables ($1,131 million) and lower tax refunds in 2010
(approximately $630 million), partially offset by an increase in net income
($588 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $2,645 million was
$748 million higher than the first six months of 2009, primarily due to
increased acquisitions ($909 million), decreased cash from divestitures ($356
million) and higher capital investments ($250 million), partially offset by the
net benefit of $767 million from purchases and sales of marketable securities
and other investments in 2010 versus 2009. Net cash used in financing
activities of $7,114 million was $1,212 million lower, compared to the first
six months of 2009, primarily due to an increased net benefit associated with
debt ($4,736 million) and higher receipts of cash from other common stock
transactions ($1,305 million), partially offset by higher payments to
repurchase common stock ($4,685 million) and increased dividend payments ($144
million).

The
workforce rebalancing charges recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and 2010
and the PLM and Geodis transactions impact the year-to-year results of the
companys reportable segments for the first half of 2010 compared to the first
half of 2009. Workforce rebalancing charges were incurred in every segment in
the first quarter of both years. The PLM transaction gain was recorded in
Software in the first quarter of 2010 and the Geodis transaction gain was
recorded in the following segments in the first quarter of 2009: Global
Technology Services ($81 million), Global Business Services ($46 million),
Software ($106 million) and Systems and 
Technology ($64 million). In the segment analysis below and in the
Global Financing analysis on page 66, each segments pre-tax income and
pre-tax margin for the six months ended June 30 is presented on an as
reported basis and on a basis normalized for these actions in both years to
provide a better perspective of the underlying operational performance of the
segments.
 
Global Services
 
The Global Services segments, Global Technology
Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS) returned to growth at
constant currency in the second quarter, delivering $13,717 million in combined
revenue, an increase of 2.0 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared
to the second quarter of 2009. Adjusted for currency, the combined services
revenue growth rate in the second quarter improved 3 points compared to the first
quarter of 2010, largely driven by Global Business Services. In the first six
months of 2010, total Global Services revenue was $27,433 million, an increase
of 3.1 percent (flat adjusted for currency) year to year. Total Global Services
signings in the second quarter of $12,299 million decreased 12.1 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency) year to year. In the second quarter, the company
signed 15 deals greater than $100 million. Outsourcing signings of $6,470
million decreased 18.8 percent (19 percent adjusted for currency).  Within outsourcing, based on an assessment of
larger contracts, contract extensions declined year to year, as a number of
large deals pushed out of the second quarter. Contract extensions have little
to no benefit to near-term revenue. In contrast, new business signings in
outsourcing increased year to year which will have a more immediate
contribution to revenue. Based on this assessment, the company expects to yield
more revenue over the next 12 months from this quarters outsourcing signings
of $6,470 million than the second quarter of 2009 outsourcing signings of
$7,966 million. Total transactional signings of $5,829 million decreased 3.2
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency), an improvement sequentially from
first-quarter 2010 at constant currency. Transactional signings in Integrated
Technology Services improved compared to the first quarter at constant currency
and AMS Systems Integration signings increased year to year. Consulting
signings declined year to year in the second quarter as a number of
transactions moved out of the quarter, although signings in North America were
up 17 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency). Total consulting signings
increased in the first half of 2010 compared to the prior year. The estimated
Global Services backlog at actual currency rates was $129 billion at June 30,
2010,

from first-quarter 2010. Consulting and AMS both had revenue growth in the
second quarter of 2010, led by North America with constant currency growth of 8
percent. Revenue performance in the second quarter was broad based throughout
the segment with year-to-year growth in both the major markets and growth
markets, and in all sectors, with the exception of the communications sector.
From an offering perspective, both business analytics and Smarter Planet had
double-digit year to year revenue growth in the second quarter.

Global Services signings are managements initial
estimate of the revenue value of a clients commitment under a Global Services
contract. Signings are used by management to assess period performance of
Global Services management. There are no third-party standards or requirements
governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management
involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment,
including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of
termination charges or wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS Outsourcing, ITS and GBS
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new revenue value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS and
Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under
contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject
to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes
in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not
materialized and adjustments for currency.
 
Contract portfolios
purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments
provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed
incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Software
revenue of $5,277 million increased 2.1 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency) year to year in the second quarter and increased 6.1 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency) to $10,296 million in the first six months of
2010. Adjusting for the divested PLM activities, revenue grew at 6 percent,
adjusted for currency, in both the second quarter and first six months of 2010.
Revenue performance was led by key branded middleware. The Software business is
capturing growth in key areas like business analytics, storage management and
business integration. The breadth and diversity of the software portfolio,
combined with strategic investments in high growth areas have enabled the
company to achieve consistently strong results in the software segment.
 
Key branded middleware revenue increased 9.4 percent
(10 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2010 and increased
11.1 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2010,
when compared to the same periods in 2009. Key branded middleware accounted for
62 percent of total Software revenue in the second quarter, up 4 points from
second-quarter 2009, and gained share for the 11th straight
quarter. The share gain was broad-based across WebSphere, Information
Management, Tivoli and Rational. Both WebSphere and Tivoli had double-digit
revenue growth year to year and the business analytics product set had strong
performance.

Software
gross profit increased 3.6 percent to $4,595 million for the second quarter and
7.0 percent to $8,839 million for the first six months of 2010, driven
primarily by higher revenue. Gross profit margins expanded 1.2 points and 0.8
points in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, versus the
prior year periods. The divestiture of the lower gross margin PLM revenue drove
the second quarter margin improvement. Software delivered pre-tax income of
$1,988 million in the second quarter of 2010, a growth of 7.4 percent compared
to the second quarter of 2009. The pre-tax profit margin expanded 1.3 points to
33.3 percent. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of margin
expansion in the Software segment. On a normalized basis, segment pre-tax
profit for the first six months of 2010 increased 14.5 percent and segment
pre-tax profit margin expanded 1.9 points to 30.2 percent.

Systems
and Technology revenue increased 3.4 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency)
and 4.1 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter
and first six months of 2010, respectively, versus the same periods in 2009.
Revenue performance was driven by continued growth in System x, Storage, Retail
Store Solutions and Microelectronics. In the second quarter, Systems and
Technology had strong performance in the growth markets. BRIC countries grew 20
percent with growth in all brands, and the company expects this strength to
continue in the second half of 2010.
 
System z revenue decreased 23.6 percent and
20.4 percent (22 percent and 20 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and first six months of 2010 versus the second quarter
and first six months of 2009, respectively. MIPS (millions of instructions per
second) shipments decreased 14 percent and 16 percent in the second
quarter and first half of 2010 versus the second quarter and first half of
2009, respectively. This performance was consistent with what the company
expected at this point in the product cycle. In mid July, the company announced
the next generation of System z, the fastest and most scalable enterprise
server in the industry. The new server will be the foundation for the companys
first System of Systems, extending mainframe governance to other industry
leading IBM technologies.
 
Power Systems revenue
decreased 10.2 percent and 13.3 percent (10 percent and
14 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2010 versus the second quarter and first six months of 2009,
respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by high-end servers. In the
second quarter, the company had 225 competitive UNIX displacements, of which
approximately two-thirds were from Sun, that resulted in $225 million of
business and contributed

to approximately four points
of share gain. This is a sequential increase of over $75 million from the first
quarter where the company gained over seven points of share. In the past six
quarters, the company has won 620 deals from Sun totaling nearly $650 million
of business. The displacement rate has been increasing and the company expects
this to continue throughout the second half of 2010. The new Power7 mid-range
and Power7 blades products drove mid-range revenue growth of 11 percent and
blade revenue growth over 65 percent year over year. This performance drove
four points of share gain in the quarter  the 9th consecutive
quarter of share gains. In the third quarter, the company will announce Power7 high-end and entry
systems products with availability in September and the company will have
available a fully refreshed Power Systems product line in the quarter.
 
System x revenue increased
30.3 percent and 33.1 percent (30 percent and 31 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2010, respectively,
versus the second quarter and first six months of 2009. High-end System x
revenue increased 17 percent and 14 percent in the second quarter and first six
months of 2010 versus the comparable periods of 2009, respectively, while total
server revenue increased 30 and 33 percent for the second quarter and first six
months of 2010 versus the same periods in 2009, respectively. System x blades
revenue increased 16 percent and 32 percent in the second quarter and first
half of 2010 versus the second quarter and first half of 2009, respectively.
The high-end product performance, the growth of blades and improved operational
performance contributed to improved gross margin in System x.
 
Storage
revenue increased 4.5 percent and 7.4 percent (6 percent and 7
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2010, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2009. Total disk revenue
increased 12 percent and 15 percent in the second quarter and the first six
months of 2010 versus the second quarter and first six months of 2009,
respectively. These increases were driven by continued strength in high-end
offerings, XIV and DS8000. XIV added over 130 new customers in the second
quarter and revenue more than doubled versus the second quarter of 2009. Tape
revenue declined 14 percent and 10 percent in the second quarter and the first
six months of 2010, respectively, versus the comparable periods of 2009,
respectively.
 
Microelectronics OEM revenue
increased 23.2 percent and 19.8 percent (23 percent and 20 percent adjusted for
currency), respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2010
versus the comparable periods of 2009, respectively. The primary mission of
this business is to provide leadership technology for the systems business.
Both the 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter semiconductor fabrication facilities
are fully utilized.
 
Retail Stores Solutions
revenue increased 30.6 percent and 34.0 percent (33 percent and 34 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2010,
respectively, versus the same periods in 2009, respectively, reflecting an
improvement in the retail industry.

Gross margin decreased 1.0
point in the second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year. The decline was
driven by impacts due to revenue mix (4.1 points), margin declines in Power
Systems (0.5 points) and System z (0.4 points), partially offset by margin
improvements in Microelectronics (1.9 points) and System x (1.3 points). First
half gross margin decreased 0.7 points compared to the first half of 2009. The
decline was driven by impacts due to revenue mix (4.4 points), margin declines
in Power Systems (0.7 points) and System z (0.4 points), partially offset by
margin improvements in Microelectronics (1.9 points) and System x (1.5 points).
 
Systems and Technologys

       Total Selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 1.1 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2010 versus the second quarter
of 2009.  Overall, the decrease was
driven by reductions in operational expense (down 4 points) as the company
continues to focus on disciplined expense management, while investing for
future growth. As an example, while overall operational SG&A was down 4
points in the quarter, operational SG&A in the growth markets was up 10
percent. Over the past two years, the companys operational SG&A in the
growth markets has been 10 or more points higher than the major markets.
Currency impacts (1 point) and acquisition-related spending (2 points),
partially offset the decline in operational expense in the second quarter.
 
       Total SG&A expense increased
3.5 percent (essentially flat adjusted for currency) in the first six
months of 2010 versus the first six months of 2009. Overall, the increase was
driven by currency impacts (4 points) and acquisition-related spending (2
points), partially offsetting the decline in operational expense (2 points).
Workforce reductions expense increased $241 million due primarily to actions
taken by the company in the first quarter of 2010, with the majority of the
spending in Europe and Asia Pacific. The company expects most of the benefit
from these actions in the second half of 2010, with payback by the end of the
year. Bad debt expense decreased $93 million reflecting the improving credit
environment. The accounts receivable provision coverage is 2.2 percent, a
decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year and an increase of 20 basis
points from year-end 2009.

       Other (income) and expense was income of
$95 million and $28 million in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase in income in the second quarter of 2010 was
primarily driven by a provision for losses related to a joint venture
investment ($119 million) recorded in the second quarter 2009 and higher
foreign currency transaction gains ($76 million). These increases were
partially offset by increased losses on derivative instruments ($151 million).
Included within the foreign currency hedging activity, the company hedges its
major anticipated cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency
volatility in its global cash planning (the hedge of anticipated royalties and
cost transactions programs as discussed in Note 7, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 16 to 24), which also reduces volatility in the
year-over-year results.  The total impact
of these specific hedging programs was a $136 million year-to-year impact and
is reflected in expense and cost of goods sold. The expense impacts from these
hedge programs reflected in other (income) and expense was income of $29
million in the second quarter of 2010 versus income of $102 million in the
second quarter of 2009, an increase in expense of $73 million year to year.
 
       Other (income) and expense was income of
$640 million and $331 million for the first six months of 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase in income for the first six months of 2010 was
primarily driven by the net gain from the PLM transaction in the first quarter
of 2010 ($591 million) reflected in Other in the table above, versus a gain
from the divestiture of the core logistics operations to Geodis in the first
quarter of 2009 ($298 million), a provision for losses related to a joint
venture investment ($119 million) recorded in the second quarter 2009 and
higher foreign currency transaction gains ($169 million) versus the prior year.
These items were partially offset by higher losses on derivative instruments
($289 million) as discussed above.

       The decrease in
interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 versus the
same periods of 2009 was primarily driven by lower average debt. Interest
expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global
Financing external business. See page 70 for additional information regarding

respectively, a decrease of $52 million and $156 million, respectively, year to
year.

       In the second quarter, total
retirement-related plan cost increased by $3 million compared to the second
quarter of 2009, driven by an increase in the cost of defined benefit plans of
$5 million. Total cost for the first six months of 2010 decreased $25 million
versus the first half of 2009 driven by a decrease in the cost of defined
contribution plans of $30 million.
 
       As discussed in the Looking Forward
section on pages 61 to 63, the company has begun to characterize certain
retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing
this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter
were $432 million, a reduction of $30 million compared to the second quarter of
2009, driven by a $24 million reduction in total service cost. Non-operating
costs of ($113 million) increased $32 million in the second quarter compared to
the prior year driven primarily by an increase in recognized actuarial losses.
For the first six months of 2010, operating retirement-related costs were $916
million, a decrease of $77 million compared to the first six months of 2009.
This decrease was driven by a $37 million reduction in total service cost and a
$30 million reduction in the cost of defined contribution plans. Non-operating
costs of ($189 million) increased $51 million in the first half compared to the
prior year driven primarily by an increase in recognized actuarial losses of
$77 million.
 
       See Note 11, Retirement-Related
Benefits on pages 28 to 30 for additional plan cost detail.
 
Business Acquisition
Acquired Intangible Asset Amortization

Taxes
 
       The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010
was 26.0 percent versus an effective tax rate of 27.2 percent for the second
quarter of 2009. The effective tax rates for the first six months of 2010 and
2009 were 26.0 percent and 26.9 percent, respectively. The decrease in the rate
for the second quarter and for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to
the prior year periods, was primarily due to the charge recorded in the prior
year related to a joint venture and an increase in foreign tax credit benefits.

With limited exception, the company is no longer
subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing
authorities for years through 2003. The years subsequent to 2003 contain
matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax
laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income,
deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always
uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and interest have
been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2009 increased by $1,002 million for the first six months of 2010 to $5,792
million.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1,412
million during the second quarter of 2010.  During the first quarter, the
amount of unrecognized tax benefits had decreased by $410 million, primarily
driven by a payment of $370 million on an assessment received related to a
foreign audit. Additionally, the company had certain foreign tax loss
carryforwards that had not been reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position. In April 2010, the company decided to seek benefit for
these losses and appeal the assessment mentioned above. The second quarter
increase of $1,412 million in unrecognized tax benefits includes $1,320 million
related to this item. The total amount
of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate is $5,210 million at June 30, 2010.
 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit
of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2006 and 2007 in the first quarter of
2009.  The company anticipates that the final settlement of the 2006-2007
IRS audit will be completed by the end of 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2008,
the company was unable to reach agreement with the IRS related to valuation
matters associated with the intercompany transfer of certain intellectual
property in 2005. See the companys 2009 Annual Report on page 103 for
additional information. The company believes it may be able to reach a
resolution with the IRS by the end of 2010 on this matter.
 
Earnings
Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.  Diluted
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options and stock awards.

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At June 30, 2010, the
companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. Cash on hand at
quarter end was $10,325 million. Total debt of $26,650 million increased $551
million from prior year-end levels. The commercial paper balance at June 30,
2010 was $2,250 million, up from $235 million at year end. The company
continues to have substantial flexibility in the market. In the first six
months, the company generated $8,203 million in cash from operations, a
decrease of $924 million compared to the first six months of 2009 (see cash
flow analysis on page 59). The company has consistently generated strong
cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of
liquidity through the capital markets and its $10 billion global credit
facility. The companys strong cash flow and substantial cash position permits
the company to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive
long-term opportunities.
 
The assets and debt
associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of
the companys financial position. The financial position amounts appearing on
pages 4 and 5 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The
amounts appearing in the separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 65,

impact.
 
·                  A decline of $1,858 million in cash and cash
equivalents (see cash flow analysis on page 59); partially offset by
 
·                  An increase of $1,178 million in prepaid
expenses and other current assets driven by derivative assets and corresponding
collateral as a result of changes in foreign currency rates primarily for
instruments in cash flow hedging relationships.
 
Current
liabilities decreased $1,009 million, including a $934 million benefit from
currency, as a result of:
 
·                  A decrease of $931 million in taxes payable
primarily due to foreign tax payments,
 
·                  A decrease
of  $683 million in other accrued
expenses and liabilities mainly due to a decrease of $436 million in derivative
liabilities as a result of changes in foreign currency rates primarily for
instruments in cash flow hedging relationships, and
 
·                  A decrease of
$483 million in compensation and benefits reflecting declines from typically
higher year-end balances, a decrease in deferred income of $173 million and a
decrease in accounts payable of $203 million; partially offset by

Net
cash from operating activities decreased $924 million as compared to the first
six months of 2009 driven by the following key factors:
 
·                  A decrease in cash provided by Global
Financing receivables of $1,131 million as a result of improved volumes in
2010;
 
·                  Higher net income tax payments of
approximately $700 million driven by foreign tax payments; and
 
·                  A decrease in cash of approximately $630
million as a result of lower tax refunds in 2010 versus the previous year;
partially offset by
 
·                  Improved net income of $588 million;
 
·                  A decrease in cash used by accounts payable
of  $527 million; and
 
·                  Increased cash provided by advanced billings
of  $357 million.
 
Net
cash used in investing activities increased $748 million driven by:
 
·                  An increase of $909 million in cash used for
acquisitions;
 
·                  Increased net capital spending of $282
million primarily for new hardware products and semiconductor technology ;
 
·                  A decrease in cash from divestitures of $356
million as a result of the Geodis transaction in 2009; and,
 
·                  A decrease in cash provided by Global
Financing non-operating receivables of $204 million as a result of improved
volumes in 2010; partially offset by
 
·                  A net benefit of $972 million from purchases
and sales of marketable securities and other investments, primarily due to
proceeds from short-term marketable securities of $559 million and proceeds
from the PLM transaction in the first quarter of 2010 of $460 million.

in comparison to net cash payments to settle debt of $4,006 million in 2009;
and
 
·                  An increase of $1,305 million in cash
generated from other common stock transactions primarily due to higher stock

$1,458 million in long-term financing receivables ($1,136 million
adjusted for currency) driven by maturities exceeding originations;
 
·                  A decrease of $1,072 million in noncurrent
deferred taxes ($1,055 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by
derivative related activity; and
 
·                  A decrease of $631 million in plant, rental
machines and other property ($241 million adjusted for currency); partially
offset by
 
·                  An increase of $659 million in investments

·                  An increase of $573 million in prepaid
pension assets; and
 
·                  An increase of $354 million ($845 million
adjusted for currency) in goodwill as a result of the current year
acquisitions.
 
Long-term
debt decreased $915 million primarily due to reclasses to short-term debt as
certain instruments approach maturity.
 
Other
noncurrent liabilities, excluding debt, decreased $2,100 million ($1,432
million due to currency) primarily driven by:
 
·                  A decrease in
retirement and nonpension benefit obligations of $1,355 million ($584 million adjusted
for currency) primarily driven by contributions to non-U.S. plans; and
 
·                  A decrease of
$524 million in other noncurrent liabilities mainly due to a decrease in
derivative liabilities as a result of changes in foreign currency rates
primarily for instruments in cash flow hedging relationships.

Global Financing provides
financing predominantly for the companys external client assets as well as for
assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global
Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global
Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services
assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The
debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 70.
 
Given the significant
leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes
Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is more
representative of the companys core business operations. This ratio can vary
from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt
positions.
 
Core
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
23.1 percent at June 30, 2010 compared to 16.0 percent at December 31,
2009. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in non-Global Financing
debt of $1,744 million and a decrease in non-Global Financing equity of $1,397
million from December 31, 2009 balances.
 
Consolidated
debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2010 was 55.7 percent versus 53.4
percent at December 31, 2009.
 
Equity
 
Total equity decreased
$1,579 million primarily as a result of an increase in treasury stock of $8,033
million, driven by common stock repurchases in the first six months of 2010, and
a reduction in foreign currency translation adjustments of $1,081 million,
partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $4,423 million, an
increase of $1,712 million in common stock, increased gains on cash flow hedge
derivatives of $1,015 million and a lower pension adjustment of $392 million.
 
Looking Forward
 
The
company entered 2010 in excellent operational and financial position.
Going-forward, the company will continue to transform the business by executing
its strategy to shift to higher-value areas, improving operating leverage
through productivity and investing where management sees the best long-term
opportunities. This transformation delivered solid performance in the first
half of 2010 and continues to position the company for growth going forward.
 
In
January 2010, the company disclosed that it expected earnings of at least
$11.00 per diluted share for the full year 2010, with consistent earnings per
share growth throughout the year. In April 2010, the company increased its
expectation for 2010 to at least $11.20 in earnings per diluted share for the
full year.
 
In
May 2010, the company met with investors and analysts and provided an
update on its 2010 earnings per share road map; discussed changes that it is
making to the way the company will report on its performance; and, introduced a
new road map for earnings per share in 2015. With respect to the 2010 earnings
per share road map objective of $10 to $11 per share, the company remains well
ahead of pace - achieving the low end of its objective one year ahead of
schedule with diluted earnings per share of $10.01 in 2009. For 2010, the
company reiterated its expectation of at least $11.20 in earnings per diluted
share for 2010.
 
Looking
forward to the second half of 2010, the company will have several new product
introductions in the Systems and Technology business; investments in growth
initiatives will continue to be leveraged; acquisitions announced in the second
quarter will close and integration efforts will begin; the company will yield
the benefits of the first-quarter workforce rebalancing actions; and the
company will continue to drive efficiencies and increase productivity. In July 2010,
the company increased its expectation for 2010 to at least $11.25 in earnings
per diluted share for the full year.

Within the Global Services
business, in the second quarter the revenue growth rate improved sequentially
with a return to revenue growth at constant currency for total Global Services.
GBS revenue increased 3 percent, adjusted for currency, with 8 points of
improvement in the growth rate. The business improved AMS signings and
delivered good new business signings within outsourcing. The backlog at $129
billion, increased $1 billion, adjusted for currency, compared to the prior
year. In addition, the business has a good pipeline of services deals going
into the third quarter. In the second half of 2010, the company expects the total
Global Services revenue growth rate to improve, driven by GBS with its higher
transactional content. With improved revenue growth rates in the second half
and the benefits of the workforce rebalancing actions in the first quarter, the
company also expects to achieve margin expansion in the second half of 2010.
 
The breadth and diversity of
the companys software portfolio, combined with strategic investments in high
growth areas, have enabled the company to achieve consistently strong results
in the Software segment. Clients continue to rely on the extensive middleware
portfolio to help them transform their business, streamline costs and seek new
business opportunities. The company will continue to focus on expanding its
software capabilities through a combination of internal development and
strategic acquisitions. In the third quarter, the company expects the Software
business to deliver similar levels of revenue performance as the second
quarter.
 
The Systems and Technology
business will continue to invest for continued technology leadership in areas
that contribute to high value growth opportunities. It will focus on
technologies that differentiate its offerings, including industry-leading
microprocessor technology, workload optimized systems and infrastructure-wide
virtualization capabilities with tools that help clients consolidate resources,
manage workloads, automate processes, improve energy efficiency and optimize
delivery of IT services. In the third quarter, the company will announce the
Power7 entry and high-end systems with availability in September. In addition,
in July, the company announced the next generation System z mainframe which
provides 40 percent more performance on a mix of workloads than the equivalent
z10 mainframe. In the second quarter, the Systems and Technology business
continued to improve its revenue growth rate. With the introduction of the new
high-end systems in the third quarter, the company expects the segments
revenue growth rate to improve (adjusted for currency) in the third and fourth
quarters and the segments pre-tax income to increase at a double-digit rate
for the second half of the year.
 
In 2010, Global Financing
will continue to focus on expanding its core business by accelerating growth in
the participation rates for IBM products and services transactions. In
addition, the business will drive increased operational efficiency and sales
productivity through the deployment of its single operating model initiative.
This global initiative is focused on simplifying processes, standardizing
operations and optimizing business performance.
 
The company expects 2010
pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $1.5 billion, an
increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2009. This estimate reflects
current pension plan assumptions and the impacts of recent non-U.S. pension
plan redesign efforts. See the companys 2009 Annual Report, note U, Retirement-Related
Benefits, on pages 109 through 121 for additional information.
 
The company expects in the
normal course of business that its effective tax rate in 2010 will be
approximately 26.0 - 26.5 percent. The rate will change period to period based
on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and
changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix
of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
In an effort to provide
better transparency into the operational results of the business, beginning in
2011, the company will separate business results into operating and
non-operating categories. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure that
excludes the effects of acquisition-related charges and certain retirement-related
costs and one time charges. For acquisitions, operating earnings will exclude
the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable
restructuring and related expenses and tax plan changes resulting from
acquisitions. In the technology sector, it is common practice to provide
earnings information on a non-GAAP basis that excludes acquisition-related
items. Within retirement-related, given the significant impact that the debt
and equity markets can have on the companys retirement-related costs and the
fact that these market forces are not under direct management control and are
non-operational, the company has characterized certain items as operating and
others as non-operating. The company will include defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost, amortization of prior
service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings.
Non-operating retirement-related cost will include defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan
assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the
impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and multi-employer/pension

insolvency/other
costs. These costs are primarily those related to changes in pension plan
assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance and the company
considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the
business.
 
Overall, the company
believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings beginning
in 2011 will provide better transparency into both the operational results of
the business and the performance of the companys pension plans; improve
visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational
performance; enable better comparison to peer companies; and, allow the company
to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. There will
be no changes to balance sheet or cash flow presentation. The company will
provide this view of its performance in addition to its GAAP reporting.
 
For the 2015 road map, the
company will utilize operating earnings to establish its objectives and track
its progress.  The companys 2015 road
map continues to focus on the key financial drivers of long term earnings per
share growth. The company will continue to leverage its base business model for
revenue growth by entering new markets and launching new offerings and
products, both organically developed and acquired. The company will remain
focused on margin expansion through productivity and portfolio management. The
company will deploy cash to fund growth initiatives and provide returns to
shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. This road map
results in an operating earnings per share objective of at least $20 per share
for 2015.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At June 30, 2010, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at
year-end 2009. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific
currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears
in the 2009 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions,
on pages 92 through 96.
 
In the first six months of
2010, the companys revenue increased 3.6 percent as reported and 0.8 percent
adjusted for currency. In the second quarter, revenue increased 2.0 percent as
reported and 1.6 percent adjusted for currency. These currency differences were
driven from the companys operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
The company maintains currency hedging programs for cash planning purposes
which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the
companys financial results. In addition to the translation of earnings, the
impact of currency changes also may affect the companys pricing and sourcing
actions. For example, the company may procure components and supplies in
multiple functional currencies and sell products and services in other
currencies. The company believes that some of these currency-based changes in
cost impacts the price charged to clients. However, the company estimates that
the maximum effect of currency, before taking pricing or sourcing actions into
account, and net of hedging activity, decreased total diluted earnings per
share growth by $0.10 to $0.11 in the second quarter of 2010.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by
linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. The company continues to monitor
the economic conditions in Venezuela. In Venezuela, there are official currency
rates that are fixed by the government and a parallel market of currency exchange
that enables companies to obtain foreign currency, including U.S. dollars. The
parallel rate is variable and may differ significantly from the official rates.
Accounting guidance requires that the translation of a non-U.S. entitys
financial statements into the companys consolidated financial statements be at
the rate applicable to dividend remittances. Due to the significant reduction
of currency approvals by the Venezuela government, in December 2009, the
company determined that the rate for translation should be changed to the
parallel rate at December 31, 2009.
 
In addition, due to the fact
that the blended CPI/NCPI three year cumulative inflation rate in Venezuela
reached 100 percent, the country is considered highly inflationary, consistent
with accounting standards, effective January 1, 2010. The companys
operations in Venezuela are not significant (less than 1 percent of total 2008
and 2009 revenue).

Management Discussion 
(continued)
 
On January 8, 2010, a
devaluation of the Venezuelan currency was announced. The currency market in
Venezuela will continue to be fully controlled by the government through the
Central Bank. A two-tiered official rate structure was implemented and will be
managed by the Central Bank. In the first quarter of 2010, the ability to
obtain U.S. dollars remained severely restricted, even at the new devalued
rates. The parallel market remained the primary method to obtain U.S. dollars.
Therefore, in the first quarter, the company continued to remeasure utilizing
the parallel rate.
 
On May 17, 2010, the parallel market was
suspended by the Venezuela government. The new parallel fluctuating market (SITME)
opened on June 9, 2010, controlled by the Central Bank, and with a set
daily trading rate band that was significantly lower than the previous parallel
market rate. Tight volume restrictions have been established for the new banded
market, which has been thinly traded since being opened. The SITME market is
the current viable option for obtaining currency exchange as the official rates
have not been accessible. Therefore, in the second quarter, the company
utilized the banded rate for remeasurement purposes. This resulted in the
recording of an immaterial gain in the quarter.
 
Future gains or losses from changes in the banded rate
are not expected to have a material impact given the size of the companys
operations in Venezuela.
 
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
In the companys 2009 Annual
Report, on pages 49 through 51, there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table
presented on page 49 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and
marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities
for each of the past five years. For the six months ended, or as of, as
applicable, June 30, 2010, those amounts are $8.2 billion for net cash
from operating activities, $12.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and
$10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The major rating agencies
ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30, 2010 appear in the
table below and remain unchanged from December 31, 2009. The companys
debt securities do not contain any acceleration clauses which could change the
scheduled maturities of the obligation. In addition, the company does not have ratings
trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow
the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments
thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual
agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses
which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit
rating were to fall below investment grade. At June 30, 2010, the fair
value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $688 million,
before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in
fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding
instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual
arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a
material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable
accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 6 of this
Form 10-Q and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of
cash in that format on pages 59 and 60. The following is managements

Free cash flow for the first
six months of 2010 decreased $43 million versus the first six months of 2009.
The decline year to year was primarily driven by higher capital investments and
a year-to-year impact for tax refunds (approximately $630 million), partially
offset by higher net income and sales cycle working capital improvements. Also,
in the first six months of 2010, $9,672 million was returned to shareholders through
share repurchases and dividends.
 
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the
2009 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 15, Contingencies,
on pages 33 to 35 of this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $900 million in 2010.  The
company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it
is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension
plan funding regulations.
 
Global Financing
 
Global Financing is a
reportable segment that is measured as if it were a standalone entity.
Accordingly, the information presented in this section is consistent with this
separate company view.  The mission of
Global Financing is to facilitate clients acquisition of IBM systems, software
and services with the objective of generating consistently strong returns on
equity.

Management Discussion 
(continued)
 
The
decrease in revenue in the second quarter, as compared to the same period in
2009, was primarily due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 4.1 percent
(5 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in financing revenue (down
9.9 percent to $384 million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment
sales revenue (up 13.5 percent to $160 million); and
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 3.5 percent
driven by decreases in internal financing revenue (down 3.9 percent to $132
million) and used equipment sales revenue to the System and Technology segment
(down 3.3 percent to $299 million).
 
The
decrease in revenue in the first six months of 2010, as compared to the same
period in 2009, was primarily due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 5.6 percent
(9 percent adjusted for currency) due to a decrease in financing revenue (down
8.8 percent to $799 million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment
sales revenue  (up 4.7 percent to $282
million); and
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 0.3 percent
driven by a decrease in internal financing revenue (down 5.8 percent to $281
million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales revenue to
the Global Technology Services segment (up 2.8 percent to $553 million).
 
The
decreases in financing revenue in the second quarter and the first six months
of 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009, were due to both lower asset
yields and lower average asset balances.
 
Gross
profit increased 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same
period in 2009, with gross margin increasing 2.6 points.  Gross profit increased 0.5 percent in the
first six months of 2010 compared to the prior year, with gross margin
increasing 2.5 points. The gross profit increase in both periods was due to
higher used equipment sales revenue. The margin improvement in both periods was
due to an improvement in both financing and used equipment sales margins.
 
Pre-tax income was flat in
the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Pre-tax income
increased 7.9 percent in the first six months of 2010 compared to the prior
year, primarily driven by lower financing receivables provisions of $70
million. The decrease in financing receivables provisions in 2010 was primarily
due to lower specific reserve requirements. Excluding $2 million and $5 million
of workforce rebalancing charges in the first quarter of 2010 and 2009,
respectively, pre-tax income on a normalized basis increased 7.5 percent for
the first six months of 2010 versus the prior year period.
 
Pre-tax
margins of 47.4 percent and 46.5 percent, increased 1.6 points and 4.9 points,
versus the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively. Pre-tax
margins on a normalized basis were 46.6 percent and 41.9 percent for the first
six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
The
increase in return on equity for the second quarter 2010 compared to the same
period in 2009 was primarily due to a lower average equity balance. The
increase in return on equity for the first six months of 2010 compared to the
first six months of 2009 was due to a lower average equity balance and higher
after-tax income.

See table on page 70.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds in
Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets. Client
financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and
services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM
clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for systems products, as well
as loans for systems, software and services with terms generally from two to seven
years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services
and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis to
evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions are taken to
mitigate risks in the loan agreements which include covenants to protect
against credit deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client
financing also includes internal activity as described on page 24 of the
2009 IBM Annual Report.
 
Commercial financing
receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing
for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for
inventory financing and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30
to 90 days.  These short-term receivables
are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit analysis in
order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
At
June 30, 2010, substantially all financing assets are IT related assets,
and approximately 64 percent of the external portfolio is with investment grade
clients with no direct exposure to consumers or mortgage assets.

New
financing originations exceeded cash collections of commercial financing
assets, while cash collections exceeded new originations of client financing
assets; resulting in a net decrease in financing assets in the second quarter
of 2010. Cash collections of both client and commercial financing assets
exceeded new financing originations in the first six months of 2010, which
resulted in a net decline in financing assets from December 31, 2009. The
increase in originations in both periods was due to improving volumes in
commercial financing.
 
Cash
generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany
payables and dividends to IBM.

The
percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved was 2.1 percent at December 31,
2009 and June 30, 2010.  Specific
reserves decreased 7.0 percent from $416 million at December 31, 2009 to
$387 million at June 30, 2010 driven by the disposition of receivables
previously reserved.  Unallocated
reserves decreased $47 million from $120 million at December 31, 2009
to $73 million at June 30, 2010 due to the decline in gross financing
receivables.
 
Global
Financings bad debt expense was an increase of $13 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2010, compared to an increase of $83 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The decrease in bad debt expense
was attributed to the decline in required specific reserve additions. In the
second quarter of 2010, compared to the second quarter of 2009, bad debt
expense was flat.

Residual
Value
 
Residual
value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at
lease inception.  Global Financing has
insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global
Financing optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced
from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease
arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at the end of a lease, represented 47.1 percent
and 43.6 percent of Global Financings revenue in the second quarter and first
six months, respectively, of 2010 and 44.4 percent and 40.7 percent in the
second quarter and first six months, respectively, of 2009.  The percentage increase in the second quarter
of 2010 and the first six months of 2010 was driven primarily by the decrease
in financing revenue. The gross margins on these sales were 55.5 percent and
53.7 percent in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. The gross
margins were 53.3 percent and 52.0 percent for the first six months of 2010 and
2009, respectively. The increase in both periods was driven primarily by an
improvement in internal sales margins.
 
The following table presents
the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type, direct
financing and operating leases at January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2010.
In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at June 30, 2010 is
expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that
are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease
or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees
were $125 million and $160 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009,
respectively, and $216 million and $266 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, respectively. The associated
aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were
$7 million and $10 million for the financing transactions originated
during the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009,
respectively, and $12 million and $16 million for the financing
transactions originated during the six months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30,
2009, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.7 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2010 and $1.3 million for the quarter ended June 30,
2009, and $1.2 million and $2.1 million for each of the six month
periods ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, respectively.

The company funds Global Financing
through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans
and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company
to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing
receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 67.
 
The
Global Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys
external clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company. As
previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as if it were a
standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting
Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global
Financing Results of Operations on page 65 and in Segment Information on pages 24
to 26.
 
In
the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, however, the
external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal
financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest
expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on
total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arms-length pricing in support of Global Services
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Management Discussion 

Looking
Forward
 
Global Financings financial
position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to
be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financings assets and
new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services financed to the
companys clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets
are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financings offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financings originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
IBM continues to access both
the short-term commercial paper market and the medium and long-term debt
markets.  A protracted period where IBM
could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in
originations.
 
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact the
credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the
level of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 69,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both
through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its
remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage
each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with
product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the
business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the
global economy.

*           On October 27, 2009 and April 27, 2010, the
Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, in
funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase program. The October 27,
2009 authorization was fully utilized by late May 2010. In each case, the
company stated that it would repurchase shares on the open market or in private
transactions depending on market conditions and it expects to use cash from
operations for the repurchases. The common stock repurchase program does not
have an expiration date. This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy
the exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock
options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection
with employee equity awards.
