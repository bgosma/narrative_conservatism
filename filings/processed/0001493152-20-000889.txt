1.
Company Overview and Basis of Presentation
 
Nature
and History of Operations
 
Notox
Technologies Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on October 29, 2007. The
Company has transitioned into developing, commercializing and promoting its patented Notox aesthetic and drug free pain management
platform. The Company’s goals are to market a credible, non-toxic alternative to Botox and subsequently develop other features
of its Notox technology such as drug-free pain management, body countering, skin tightening and anti-perspiration. In addition,
the Company is seeking to build its distribution capabilities for other medical and aesthetic products around the world.
 
On
June 28, 2013, the Company completed a reverse takeover transaction with Tropic Spa Inc. (“TSI”), a private Ontario
corporation that manufactured and sold Home Mist Tanning units that deliver a full-body application. As a result of this transaction,
the Company became a holding company operating through TSI.
 
On
June 13, 2016, the Company completed an asset acquisition transaction with Notox Bioscience Inc. (“Notox”), a private
Nevada corporation incorporated on May 31, 2016 for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the right, title and interest in and to an
exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (the “Clinic”),
an Ohio not-for-profit corporation.
 
On
December 27, 2018, the automatic expiration date for the preferred shares of 1894632 Ontario Inc. (“Subco”) issued
in connection with the TSI reverse takeover transaction was extended to December 31, 2020.
 
Going
Concern
 
As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has a deficit of $12,661,471 (August 31,
2019 - $12,418,531) since inception, a working capital deficiency of $3,742,570 (August 31, 2019 - $3,586,763) and a stockholders’
deficiency of $3,069,960 (August 31, 2019 - $2,827,020). This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital and
to implement its business plan. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Management
has evaluated the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern by assessing its ability to meet its obligations as they
become due within one year from the date of issue of the financial statements. Management’s assessment included the following
factors:
 


 
●
The
    Company’s financial condition as at the date of issue of the financial statements;

 
●
The Company’s
    actual or anticipated conditional and unconditional obligations due within one year from the date of issue of the financial
    statements;

 
●
The funds necessary
    to maintain the Company’s operations considering its current financial condition, obligations and other expected cash
    flows; and

 
●
Other conditions
    and events that may affect the Company’s ability to meet its obligations within one year from the date of issue of the
    financial statements.

 
The
Company’s CEO and President have committed to providing financing if and when necessary to fund the operating expenses for
the year ended August 31, 2020.

Company Overview and Basis of Presentation (continued)
 
Basis
of Presentation and Measurement
 
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information and the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with
the Company’s audited financial statements for the years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 and their accompanying notes.
 
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian Dollars (“CAD”). In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
of financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. Operating results
for the three months ended November 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
August 31, 2020.
 
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Principles
of Consolidation
 
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, TSI, Notox, Subco and 1894631
Ontario Inc., the Company’s subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to fair values of intangible assets, useful
lives of intangible assets and the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets. The Company bases its estimates
on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities.
 
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 
Carrying
values of cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, advances from related parties/shareholders, stock purchase
warrants, license assignment fee and accrued interest payable, and stock subscribed in advance approximate fair value because
of the short-term nature of these items.
 
3.
Fair Value Measurements
 
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value as follows:
 
Level
1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
Level
2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
 
Level
3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, which require management judgment or estimation.
The Company measures its financial instruments at fair value.

License Agreement, Net
 
On
December 1, 2012, Zoran Holding Corporation (“ZHC”) and the Clinic entered into the License Agreement whereby the
Clinic granted ZHC an exclusive worldwide license in the field of aesthetics and pain to make, use, offer to sell, sell and import
certain products throughout the term of the License Agreement. Royalties and other payments are payable quarterly. Notox is required
to achieve two commercial milestones: first commercial sale within nine months following regulatory approval, and regulatory filings
submitted to regulatory authorities by November 30, 2019. The Clinic and Notox are working on completing an amendment to the License
Agreement that would extend the November 30, 2019 deadline referenced above, based on the clear development milestones and schedule
to be agreed upon not later than March 31, 2020.
 
As
of November 30, 2019, all accrued and unreimbursed patenting costs totaled $271,908 (August 31, 2019 - $264,113). Failure to achieve
these milestones, without satisfactory justification, constitutes a material breach of the License Agreement giving the Clinic
the right, but not the obligation, to convert the License Agreement to a non-exclusive license or terminate the License Agreement.
The Clinic has the right to verify Notox’s compliance with the License Agreement.
 
Pursuant
to above, the gross carrying value of the License Agreement is as follows:
 

 

 
As
of November 30, 2019, amortization expense on the License Agreement for the next five years was expected to be as follows:

totaled $23,068 (August 31, 2019 - $21,871).
 
8.
License Assignment Fee and Accrued Interest Payable
 
Pursuant
to an amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement between the Company, Notox and the shareholders of Notox, the Company is required
to pay an aggregate of US$1,000,000 to Zoran K Corporation, a private Ontario corporation (“ZKC”) in the form of a
one-time assignment fee. The assignment fee payable is repayable in monthly instalments of US$50,000 beginning on October 1, 2016.
Upon completion of any equity financing pursuant to which the Company raises gross proceeds of at least US$1,000,000, the outstanding
balance is to be repaid in full.
 
Since
September 1, 2017, interest of 24% per annum, compounding annually, has been accrued on the outstanding balance payable. Interest
expense of US$335,558 ($446,133) was accrued on the balance payable as at November 30, 2019. At November 30, 2019, the balance
of the license assignment fee payable and interest payable to ZKC was US$830,558 ($1,104,264) (August 31, 2019 - US$783,667
($1,042,561)). See Note 4.

stock
 
As
at November 30, 2019, the Company was authorized to issue 500,000,000 (August 31, 2019 - 500,000,000) shares of common stock at
a par value of US$0.001.
 
On
October 9, 2018, the Company’s shareholders and directors approved a change of the Company’s name from Tropic International
Inc. to Notox Technologies Corp. and an increase in the Company’s authorized common stock to 500,000,000 shares. The name
change and authorized common stock increase were effected November 19, 2018. At November 30, 2019, the Company had 57,625,343
shares of common stock legally issued and outstanding (August 31, 2019 - 57,625,343).
 
On

Stockholders’ Deficiency (continued)
 
At
November 30, 2019, the stock purchase warrants were fair valued at $nil (August 31, 2019 - $1,776) and the weighted-average remaining
contractual life of US dollar warrants outstanding was 0.00 years (August 31, 2019 - 0.02 years).
 
The
Company used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair values of unit warrants and finder’s warrants
issued pursuant to private placements during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and the year ended August 31, 2019 with
the following assumptions:

Risks and Uncertainties
 
The
Company’s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect its future
operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to: current economic
conditions; the Company’s degree of success in securing regulatory approval and marketing products developed pursuant to
the License Agreement; increasing competition; and dependence on its existing management and key personnel.
 
12.
Accounting Pronouncements
 
In
November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments –
Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 842, Leases”, to introduce amendments which will affect
the effective dates of the above-noted Topics. The Company will be evaluating the impact this standard will have on the
Company’s financial statements.
 
In
April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses,
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments”, to introduce amendments which will affect the
recognition and measurement of financial instruments, including derivatives and hedging. Only Topic 4 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact this
standard will have on the Company’s financial statements.
 
In
March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, “Leases (Topic 842)”, to introduce amendments which will affect all lessors
that are not manufactures or dealers, and those which are depository and lending entities. The amendments in this update amend
Topic 842, and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this pronouncement on the condensed consolidated financial
statements.
 
In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements”, which
will improve the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard
removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company will be evaluating the impact this standard will have on the Company’s
financial statements.

Contingent Liability
 
Pursuant
to the reverse takeover transaction with TSI, the Company may be required to acquire up to 296,500 common shares of TSI, being
those TSI shares still outstanding, in exchange for 148,250 preferred shares of Subco on a one-for-two basis. Such preferred shares
would then be exchangeable on the same basis as the 49,851,751 Subco preferred shares currently outstanding. See Note 10.
 
14.
Subsequent Event
 
The
Company’s management has evaluated subsequent events up to January 21, 2020, the filing date of the condensed consolidated
financial statements, pursuant to the requirements of ASC 855 and has determined that there have been events that have occurred
that would require a disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
On
December 1, 2019, the Company entered into an option and put agreement (the “Definitive Agreement”) with Xthetica
Inc. (“NewCo”), a newly incorporated Nevada corporation, and the sole shareholder of NewCo (the “NewCo Shareholder”)
pursuant to which the NewCo Shareholder granted the Company the sole and exclusive right and option to purchase all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of NewCo (the “NewCo Stock”) in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of up to 10,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.
The option is exercisable by the Company in tranches over a period of three years beginning on January 1, 2021.
 
Each
share issued upon the exercise of an option will be issued at a deemed price per share equal to the value of the Company’s
common stock on the OTCQB (or such other stock exchange or quotation medium on which the shares are then trading) on the date
of issuance, while each warrant issued upon the exercise of an option will be exercisable into one share of the Company’s
common stock at a price of US$1.40 per share for a period of three years from the date of issuance, subject to standard adjustments
for stock splits, stock dividends and the like.
 
Pursuant
to the Definitive Agreement, the Company granted the NewCo Shareholder a corresponding series of put rights covering the NewCo
Stock, also exercisable in tranches over a period of three years beginning on January 1, 2021. Each put right allows the NewCo
Shareholder to cause the Company to purchase up to a certain number of shares of NewCo Stock in exchange for the issuance of a
certain number of shares of the Company’s common stock plus warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s stock on
the same terms as described above. Importantly, the exercise of each put right is subject to Xthetica Canada Inc. (“Xthetica
CA”), a newly incorporated Canadian federal corporation and subsidiary of the Company, achieving certain EBITDA milestones
in each of its financial years, as reflected in the audited financial statements of Xthetica CA.
 
Assuming
the full exercise of the option or put rights, of which there is no guarantee, NewCo will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company. To date, no option or put rights have been exercised.
 

Concurrently with the execution of the
Definitive Agreement, the Company, through Xthetica CA, entered into an assignment agreement dated December 1, 2019. Pursuant
to this agreement, Xthetica Inc., an Ontario corporation, assigned all of its rights, title and interest in and to certain of
its assets to Xthetica CA.
 
Management is currently in the process of analyzing in detail the accounting implications
of the above agreements in the light of ASC 805 (Business Combination) and will account for the transaction accordingly in the
next quarter.

PRESENTATION
OF INFORMATION
 
Except
as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this Report to “we”, “us” and “our” are
to the combined business of Notox Technologies Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
This
Report includes our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended November 30, 2019.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“US GAAP”). All financial information in this Report is presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated,
and should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto
included in this Report.
 
As
disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K dated July 3, 2013, on June 28, 2013 we completed a share exchange with Tropic Spa
Inc., an Ontario corporation (“Tropic Spa”), 1894632 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation (“Subco”), and
certain of the shareholders of Tropic Spa (collectively, the “Tropic Spa Shareholders”), pursuant to which we acquired
78,030,877 common shares, or approximately 78% of the issued and outstanding shares, of Tropic Spa in exchange for the issuance
of 78,030,877 preferred shares of Subco, our wholly owned subsidiary, to the Tropic Spa Shareholders on a one-for-one basis (the
“Share Exchange”). Each preferred share of Subco is exchangeable into one share of our common stock at the option
of the holder thereof, subject to certain restrictions. As a result of the Share Exchange, Tropic Spa became our majority-owned
subsidiary and the former shareholders of Tropic Spa became holders of the preferred shares of Subco, a company that has only
one issued and outstanding common share which is held by us. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization
effected by a share exchange, wherein Tropic Spa is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are therefore, in substance, those of Tropic Spa.
 
Also,
as disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K dated July 14, 2016, on June 13, 2016 we completed a share exchange with Notox
Bioscience Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Notox”), and all the shareholders of Notox (collectively, the “Notox
Shareholders”) pursuant to which we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Notox from the Notox Shareholders
in exchange for the issuance of 100,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock to the Notox Shareholders on a 1,000-for-one
basis (the “Notox Share Exchange”). In connection with the Notox Share Exchange, Notox acquired 100% of the right,
title and interest in and to an exclusive license agreement dated December 1, 2012, as amended on July 30, 2013 (together, the
“License Agreement”) with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (the “Clinic”) formerly held by Zoran Holding
Corporation, a private Ontario corporation (“ZHC”); Notox became our wholly-owned subsidiary; and the Notox Shareholders
acquired approximately 89% of our issued and outstanding common stock (52.5% on a fully-exchanged basis). The transaction represented
an asset acquisition and was therefore accounted for under the asset acquisition method.
 
Finally,
on August 25, 2016, we completed a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock at the ratio of one (1) new share
for every two (2) existing shares and caused Subco to do the same. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect
the reverse split except as otherwise indicated.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition has been derived from and should be read
in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear
elsewhere in this Report, as well as the “Presentation of Information” section that appears at the beginning of this
Report.
 
Overview
 
We
are a company in the business of developing and commercializing innovative technologies. Through Notox, we own 100% of the right,
title and interest in and to the License Agreement with the Clinic formerly held by ZHC. The License Agreement grants us the exclusive
license to certain patented intellectual property of the Clinic relating to the treatment of a neuromuscular defect developed
by Dr. Frank Papay, MD, FACS Chairman Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute, Cleveland Clinic, and in particular, the ability
to produce sell, improve and modernize products that incorporate such intellectual property in the fields of aesthetics, drug
free pain management, body contouring and perspiration control. We plan to develop this intellectual property into the world’s
first credible and healthier non-toxic alternative to Botox, which is a commercial form of the botulinum toxin protein used primarily
for medical and cosmetic purposes.
 
On
September 26, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the License Agreement with Notox and the Clinic, effective July 1, 2016.
The purpose of this amendment was to, among other things: (i) clarify certain vague terms of the License Agreement; (ii) include
us as a party for the purpose of guaranteeing the due and prompt payment and performance of all covenants, agreements, obligations
and liabilities of Notox; (iii) record the Clinic’s explicit consent to the assignment from ZHC to Notox; (iv) extend the
deadline for achieving the first commercial milestone (the submission of regulatory filings to applicable authorities) from November
30, 2017 to November 30, 2019; and (v) establish a second commercial milestone (the completion of at least one commercial sale
within nine months of receiving regulatory approval). Since late 2019, we have been engaged in discussions with the Clinic to
extend the November 30, 2019 date referenced in the preceding sentence, and we expect to formalize such an extension on or before
March 31, 2020.
 
Through
Tropic Spa, we have finalized the design of a personal tanning product and applied for and acquired patents for it in the United
States (the “US Patent”), Canada, Australia and China. The product consists of a unique tanning system designed for
spas, gyms, clinics and convenient home use that delivers a full-body application and eliminates the harmful health effects associated
with traditional tanning beds, and in particular, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We are currently seeking to establish
licensing opportunities for Tropic Spa’s intellectual property, but have not entered into any formal arrangements as of
the date of this Report.
 
On
December 1, 2019, we entered into an option and put agreement (the “Definitive Agreement”) with Xthetica Inc. (“NewCo”),
a newly incorporated Nevada corporation, and Manny Kapur, the sole shareholder of NewCo, pursuant to which Mr. Kapur granted us
the sole and exclusive right and option to purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NewCo (the “NewCo
Stock”) in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase
up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. The option is exercisable by us in tranches over a period of three years beginning
on January 1, 2021.
 

 5 
 

 
Each
share issued upon the exercise of an option will be issued at a deemed price per share equal to the value of our common stock
on the OTCQB (or such other stock exchange or quotation medium on which the shares are then trading) on the date of issuance,
while each warrant issued upon the exercise of an option will be exercisable into one share of our common stock at a price of
US$1.40 per share for a period of three years from the date of issuance, subject to standard adjustments for stock splits, stock
dividends and the like.
 
Pursuant
to the Definitive Agreement, we granted Mr. Kapur a corresponding series of put rights covering the NewCo Stock, also exercisable
in tranches over a period of three years beginning on January 1, 2021. Each put right allows Mr. Kapur to cause us to purchase
up to a certain number of shares of NewCo Stock in exchange for the issuance of a certain number of shares of our common stock
plus warrants to purchase shares of our stock on the same terms as described above. Importantly, the exercise of each put right
is subject to Xthetica Canada Inc. (“Xthetica CA”), a newly incorporated Canadian federal corporation and our subsidiary,
achieving certain EBITDA milestones in each of its financial years, as reflected in the audited financial statements of Xthetica
CA.
 
Assuming
the full exercise of the option or put rights, of which there is no guarantee, NewCo will become our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
In
connection with the execution and delivery of the Definitive Agreement, Xthetica Inc. (“Xthetica”), a private Ontario,
Canada corporation owned by Mr. Kapur, entered into an assignment agreement with Xthetica CA, in the form attached as Appendix
1 to the Definitive Agreement, pursuant to which Xthetica assigned 100% of its right, title and interest in and to certain assets
to Xthetica CA effective July 1, 2019. The assets include Xthetica’s rights and obligations under a series of license and
distribution agreements with manufacturers of medical aesthetics products, certain of Xthetica’s inventory, and the goodwill
of Xthetica.
 
Results
of Operations
 
Revenue
 
We
did not generate any revenue during either the three months ended November 30, 2019 or the same period in the prior year.
 
Production
Costs
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we incurred production costs of $54,804, which was equal to our gross loss for the period.
During the same period in the prior year, we incurred production costs and a gross loss of $54,680. Our production costs for both
periods consisted solely of License Agreement amortization costs ($46,867 during both periods) and patenting costs ($7,937 during
the current period vs. $7,813 during the prior period).
 
Expenses
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we incurred $189,912 in total general and administrative expenses, compared to $211,264
in such expenses during the same period in the prior year.
 
Our
expenses during the three months ended November 30, 2019 consisted of $88,251 in management-related consulting fees, $62,000 in
interest on a license assignment fee payable, $15,019 in professional fees, $12,866 in trust and filing fees, $6,229 in office
and miscellaneous expenses, $2,932 in interest on advances from related parties/shareholders, $1,574 in rent and $1,070 in travel
and entertainment expenses, as offset by a $29 foreign exchange gain.
 
During
the same period in the prior year, our expenses included $81,764 in management-related consulting fees, $52,900 in interest on
a license assignment fee payable, $37,758 in foreign exchange loss, $20,480 in professional fees, $8,794 in trust and filing fees,
$5,250 in rent, $2,820 in interest on advances from related parties/shareholders, $1,134 in travel and entertainment expenses
and $364 in office and miscellaneous expenses.
 
Apart
from the $37,787 change in our foreign exchange gain/loss and the $9,100 increase in interest on a license assignment fee payable,
our expenses were relatively consistent from period-to-period.
 
The
significant management-related consulting fees we incurred over both periods were paid to our principal executive officers and
directors.

Other
Items
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we incurred a $1,776 gain associated with the revaluation of certain outstanding warrants
to purchase shares of our common stock that are denominated in U.S. dollars, compared to a $151,565 gain on the same item during
the three months ended November 30, 2018.
 
Net
Loss
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we incurred a net loss and comprehensive loss of $242,940 and a net loss per share of
$0.00. During the same period in the prior year, we experienced a net loss and comprehensive loss of $123,132 and a net loss per
share of $0.00.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
As
of November 30, 2019, we had $9,705 in cash, $138,753 in current assets, $1,083,271 in total assets, $3,881,323 in current liabilities,
$4,153,231 in total liabilities and a working capital deficiency of $3,742,570. As of that date, we also had an accumulated deficit
of $12,661,471.
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we spent $37,609 in net cash on operating activities, compared to $32,808 in net cash
spending on operating activities during the same period in the prior year. As such, our net cash spending was relatively consistent
from period-to-period.
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we received $32,471 in net cash from investing activities, all of which was in the form
of advances from Xthetica. We did not spend any cash on investing activities during the same period in the prior year.
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, we received $Nil in net cash from financing activities, compared to receiving $27,636
in net cash from financing activities during the same period in the prior year. All of cash we received during the three months
ended November 30, 2018 was in the form of advances from related parties/shareholders.
 
During
the three months ended November 30, 2019, our cash decreased by $5,138 due to a combination of our operating and financing activities.
 
Plan
of Operations
 
Our
plan of operations over the next 12 months is to continue the process initiated by ZHC to design, manufacture and commercialize
the Notox system and its features . We expect to work closely with the Clinic in this regard, and anticipate that we will
require at least US$5,025,000 to carry out our plan, as follows:
 

 

 7 
 

 
In
addition, over the next 12 months our plan of operations through Tropic Spa is to create licensing opportunities for Tropic Spa’s
intellectual property, and in particular, its U.S., Canadian, Australian and Chinese patents. We plan to target existing and highly-recognized
brands in the tanning industry, both locally and internationally, that may be drawn to Tropic Spa’s technology in order
to better serve their existing customers and enhance their competitive advantage. We do not anticipate spending any specific amounts
for this purpose, as the creation of such opportunities will be covered by our general and administrative expenses described below.
 
We have not yet prepared a detailed 12-month
plan of operations for Xthetica CA since we only completed the asset acquisition on December 1, 2019; however, we anticipate doing
so over the next few weeks and will include the plan in our next quarterly
report on Form 10-Q.
 
We
expect to incur the following general and administrative expenses over the next 12 months. These expenses are reasonably consistent
with those from prior periods, as adjusted to reflect the expected increase in our operations and the costs of maintaining our
status as a public company.
 

 
We
do not currently have sufficient funds to carry out our entire plan of operations, so we intend to meet the balance of our cash
requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing through private placements. Currently
we are active in contacting broker/dealers in Canada and elsewhere regarding possible financing arrangements; however, we do not
currently have any agreements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be
successful in completing any such financings. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising
efforts, we may review other financing options, although we cannot provide any assurance that any such options will be available
to us or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. Further, if we are unable to secure any additional financing then we plan to reduce
the amount that we spend on our operations, including management-related consulting fees and other general and administrative
expenses, so as not to exceed the capital resources available to us.

Critical
Accounting Policies
 
Intangible
Assets
 
Patents
 
The
US Patent is recorded at the value attributed to the shares issued by Tropic Spa in connection with its acquisition less accumulated
amortization and impairment writedowns. The US Patent was issued on September 29, 2009 and is effective until September 29, 2026.
The Australian, Canadian and Chinese Patents are recorded at the application costs incurred less accumulated amortization and
impairment writedowns. The Australian Patent was issued on October 16, 2014 and is effective until April 5, 2027. The Canadian
Patent was issued on June 21, 2016 and is effective until April 5, 2027. The Chinese Patent was issued on December 28, 2016 and
is effective until February 1, 2033. Upon expiration, the patents can be extended subject to certain changes required to secure
the extension. Although the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as stability of the
industry, technological advances and legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment) can have
an adverse effect on the industry and saleability of patented products, management is not currently aware of any known adverse
factors that will affect the patents in the future.
 
Costs
incurred for patents which are in the process of being completed will be amortized over the life of the patent when the patent
is issued.
 
At
the time that the patents were issued, we did not believe that there were any limits to how long the Home Mist Tanning units could
sell in the market place. Accordingly, management had determined that the best estimate of the useful lives of the US, Australian,
Canadian and Chinese Patents were 17, 13, 11 and 16 years, respectively. During the year ended August 31, 2017 management was
not in a position to be able to estimate the future cash flows attributable to the patents with any degree of certainty. Accordingly,
the patents were written down to a nominal amount of $4.
 
Subsequent
to August 31, 2019, we were notified that the Canadian, Australian and Chinese patents had lapsed or expired.
 
License
Agreement
 
The
License Agreement is recorded at estimated fair value plus acquisition costs less accumulated amortization and impairment writedowns.
The term of the License Agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the Licensed Patents (as defined in
the License Agreement). All costs related to the development of the licensed technology are expensed as incurred.
 
The
technology licensed by Notox is a platform that provides us access to four large market segments or verticals (derma, pain, body
and headache) that include the fields of aesthetics, drug-free pain management, body contouring and perspiration control. Based
on management’s experience, it takes approximately two years to fully develop each vertical, with each vertical being developed
in sequence. Accordingly, management’s best estimate of the amortization period for the License Agreement is eight years.
 
Amortization
and Impairment
 
Definite-lived
intangible assets are required to be amortized using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the
intangible assets are consumed or utilized. Management was not able to determine with any amount of certainty the number of Home
Mist Tanning units that would be sold over the useful lives of the patents. Accordingly, the patents were being amortized on a
straight-line basis over the period of their useful lives. The License Agreement is being amortized over eight years based on
management’s best estimate of the time required to develop the four verticals as explained above.
 

 9 
 

 
Intangible
assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment. An impairment loss must be recognized if the intangible
asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds fair value. We apply the following three-step
process to identify, recognize and measure impairment of intangible assets:
 


 
●
Consider
    whether indicators of impairment are present indicating that the intangible assets’ carrying amount might not be recoverable;

 
●
If
    indicators are present, perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the intangible assets to their carrying amounts; and

 
●
If
    the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the intangible assets’ carrying amount, determine
    the intangible assets’ fair value and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

 
Because
of the unique nature of a patent and a license agreement, income-producing definite-lived intangible assets, the calculation of
cash flows can be very difficult to estimate. In this case, the estimated cash flows reflect the direct revenue expected to be
generated by the License Agreement as well as an allocation of expenses.
 
Foreign
Currency
 
Our
functional currency and the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar. Our condensed consolidated financial
statements are presented in Canadian dollars.
 
Foreign
currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the period-end exchange rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost
continue to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on the translation of
monetary items or on settlement of monetary items are recognized in the loss in the period in which they arise.
 
Stock
Purchase Warrants
 
When
we undertake a private placement, we may issue units comprised of our common stock and warrants to acquire our common stock. Warrants
with a strike price denominated in our functional currency (the Canadian dollar) are considered to be indexed to our stock and
are classified as equity. Warrants with a strike price denominated in a currency other than our functional currency are considered
not to be indexed to our stock and are classified as a liability. Warrants classified as equity are initially measured at fair
value. Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the warrants continue to be classified as equity. Warrants
classified as a liability are initially measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in profit or loss in each reporting
period.
 
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.
 
Going
Concern
 
Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies we will continue to realize our assets and discharge
our liabilities in the normal course of business. As at November 30, 2019, we had a working capital deficiency of $3,742,570 and
an accumulated deficit of $12,661,471. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from
our stockholders, our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include
any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

4. Controls and Procedures
 
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
 
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive and Chief Financial
Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation,
management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to certain deficiencies in our internal
control over financial reporting. These deficiencies include the fact that we have no audit committee, traditionally have had
no independent directors, and do not have a system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting.
 
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that a reasonable
possibility exists that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The deficiencies described above constitute, both individually and in the aggregate, a material weakness given their potential
impact on our financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting.
 
Management
is currently evaluating remediation plans for the deficiencies and will implement changes as time and financial resources allow.
 
Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
 
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) during the period ended November 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
