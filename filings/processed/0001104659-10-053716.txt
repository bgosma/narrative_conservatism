Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements
and footnotes thereto of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM
or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and
footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the companys management, these
statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature,
necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of operations,
financial position and cash flows.
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue,
costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are
reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
Actual results may be different. See the companys 2009 Annual Report on pages 52
to 54 for a discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the companys 2009 Annual Report.
 
Noncontrolling
interest amounts in income of $2.6 million and $1.3 million, net of tax, for
the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $5.4
million and $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and
2009, respectively, are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statement
of Earnings due to immateriality, but are reflected within the other (income)
and expense line item. Additionally, changes to noncontrolling interests are
presented in Note 10, Equity Activity, on pages 27 and 28.
 
Within
the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the
use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are
calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is
annotated where applicable.
 
2. Accounting
Changes: In July 2010, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to the disclosure requirements about
the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit
losses. The purpose of the additional disclosures is to enable users of
financial statements to better understand the nature of credit risk inherent in
an entitys portfolio of financing receivables and how that risk is analyzed.
For end of period balances, the new disclosures are required to be made in all
interim and annual periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. For
activity during a reporting period, the disclosures are required to be made in
all interim and annual periods after January 1, 2011. These changes will
not have an impact on the consolidated financial results as this guidance only
relates to additional disclosures.
 
In
January 2010, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements for fair
value measurements. The guidance requires previous fair value hierarchy
disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities. A
class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the
statement of financial position. In addition, significant transfers between
Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy are required to be disclosed. These
additional requirements became effective January 1, 2010 for quarterly and
annual reporting. These amendments did not have an impact on the consolidated
financial results as this guidance relates only to additional disclosures. See
Note 4, Fair Value, on pages 11 to 13 for further information. In
addition, the fair value disclosure amendments also require more detailed
disclosures of the changes in Level 3 instruments. These changes will be
effective January 1, 2011 and will not have an impact on the consolidated
financial results as this guidance only relates to additional disclosures.
 
In
October 2009, the FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance for
arrangements with multiple deliverables. The new guidance requires the use of
managements best estimate of selling price (BESP) for the deliverables in an
arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), vendor objective
evidence (VOE) or third party evidence (TPE) of the selling price is not
available. In addition, excluding specific software revenue recogniton
guidance, the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no
longer permitted, and an entity is required to allocate arrangement
consideration using the relative selling price method. In accordance with the
guidance, the company elected to early adopt its provisions as of January 1,
2010 on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements
entered into on or after that date. The adoption of this guidance did not have
a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Also,
in October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which amended the scope of
existing software revenue recognition guidance. Tangible products containing
software components and non-software components that function together to
deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the
scope of software revenue recognition guidance and are accounted for based on
other applicable revenue recognition guidance. In addition, the amendments
require that hardware components of a tangible product containing software
components are always excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance.
This guidance must be adopted in the same period that the company adopts the
amended guidance for

arrangements
with multiple deliverables described in the preceding paragraph. Therefore, the
company elected to early adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2010 on a
prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into
on or after that date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
See
Note 3, Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, on pages 8
to 11 for the required disclosures and other information related to the
adoption of these accounting standards.
 
In
June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting rules for
variable interest entities (VIEs). The new guidance eliminates the quantitative
approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of
whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. The company adopted these
amendments for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1,
2010. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
3. Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables: As discussed in Note 2, Accounting
Changes, on page 7, effective January 1, 2010 the company adopted on
a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered
into on or after that date the amended accounting guidance for
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and the amended guidance related to
the scope of existing software revenue recognition guidance. The amended
guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for the companys
revenue transactions. Most of the companys products and services qualify as
separate units of accounting.
 
The
company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple
deliverables of its products and services based on the needs of its clients.
These arrangements may include any combination of services, software, hardware
and/or financing. For example, a client may purchase a server that includes operating
system software. In addition, the arrangement may include post-contract support
for the software and a contract for post-warranty maintenance service for the
hardware. These types of arrangements can also include financing provided by
the company. These arrangements consist of multiple deliverables, with the
hardware and software delivered in one reporting period and the software
support and hardware maintenance services delivered across multiple reporting
periods. In another example, a client may outsource the running of its
datacenter operations to the company on a long term, multiple year basis and
periodically purchase servers and/or software products from the company to
upgrade or expand its facility. The outsourcing services are provided on a
continuous basis across multiple reporting periods and the hardware and
software products are delivered in one reporting period. To the extent that a
deliverable in a multiple-deliverable arrangement is subject to specific
guidance that deliverable is accounted for in accordance with such specific
guidance. Examples of such arrangements may include leased hardware which is
subject to specific leasing guidance or software which is subject to specific
software revenue recognition guidance on whether and/or how to separate
multiple deliverable arrangements into separate units of accounting
(separability) and how to allocate the arrangement consideration among those
separate units of accounting (allocation). For all other deliverables in
multiple-deliverable arrangements, the guidance below is applied for
separability and allocation. A multiple-deliverable arrangement is separated
into more than one unit of accounting if the following criteria are met:
 
·                  The delivered
item(s) has value to the client on a stand-alone basis; and
·                  If the arrangement includes
a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or
performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and
substantially in the control of the company.
 
If these criteria are not met, the arrangement is
accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being
recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier
of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is
delivered. If these criteria are met for each element and there is a relative
selling price for all units of accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement
consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each
units relative selling price. The revenue recognition policies described below
are then applied to each unit of accounting, as applicable.
 
Services
 
The
companys primary services offerings include information technology (IT)
datacenter and business process outsourcing, application management services,
consulting and systems integration, technology infrastructure and system
maintenance, Web hosting and the design and development of complex IT systems
to a clients specifications (design and build). These services are provided on
a time-and-material basis, as a fixed-price contract or as a fixed-price per
measure of output contract and the contract terms range from less than one year
to over 10 years.

Revenue
from IT datacenter and business process outsourcing contracts is recognized in
the period the services are provided using either an objective measure of
output or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Under the
output method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on the services
delivered in the period.
 
Revenue
from application management services, technology infrastructure and system
maintenance and Web hosting contracts is primarily recognized on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the contracts. Revenue from
time-and-material contracts is recognized as labor hours are delivered and
direct expenses are incurred. Revenue related to extended warranty and product
maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery
period.
 
Revenue
from fixed-price design and build contracts is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion (POC) method.  Under the POC method, revenue
is recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the
total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract. If circumstances arise
that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress
toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may
result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such
revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
gave rise to the revision become known by management.
 
Hardware
 
The companys hardware offerings include the sale or
lease of system servers, storage solutions, retail store systems and the sale
of semiconductor design and manufacturing services. The company provides
warranties for its hardware products that range up to three years, with the
majority being either one year or three years. The company also offers
installation services for its more complex products.
 
Revenue from hardware sales and sales-type leases is
recognized when risk of loss has transferred to the client and there are no
unfulfilled company obligations that affect the clients final acceptance of
the arrangement. Any cost of standard warranties and remaining obligations that
are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue
is recognized. Revenue from extended warranty contracts, for which the company
is obligated to perform, is recorded as deferred income and subsequently
recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period. Revenue from
rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the rental or lease.
 
Software
 
Revenue from perpetual (one-time charge) license
software is recognized at the inception of the license term if all revenue
recognition criteria have been met. Revenue from term (recurring license
charge) license software is recognized on a subscription basis over the period
that the client is entitled to use the license. Revenue from subscription and
support, which includes unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period such items are
delivered. In multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements that include software
that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole (software
multiple-deliverable arrangements), software and software-related elements are
accounted for in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance.
Software-related elements include software products and services for which a
software deliverable is essential to its functionality. Tangible products
containing software components and non-software components that function
together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no
longer within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and are
accounted for based on other applicable revenue recognition guidance.
 
A software multiple-deliverable arrangement is
separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following
criteria are met:
 
·                  The functionality of the
delivered element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered element(s);
 
·                  There is VSOE of fair value
of the undelivered element(s). VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged
when the deliverable is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and
not as part of the multiple-deliverable arrangement; and
 
·                  Delivery of the delivered
element(s) represents the culmination of the earnings process for that
element(s).
 
If
any one of these criteria are not met, the arrangement is accounted for as one
unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized on a
straight-line basis or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria
are met or when the

last
undelivered element is delivered. If these criteria are met for each element
and there is VSOE of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement,
the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting
based on each units relative VSOE of fair value. There may be cases, however,
in which there is VSOE of fair value of the undelivered item(s) but no
such evidence for the delivered item(s). In these cases, the residual method is
used to allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the
amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item(s) equals the
total arrangement consideration less the aggregate VSOE of fair value of the
undelivered elements.
 
The companys
multiple-deliverable arrangements may have a stand-alone software deliverable
that is subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance. The
revenue for these multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to the
software deliverable and the non-software deliverables based on the relative
selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the
hierarchy (VSOE, TPE or BESP) in the new amended revenue accounting guidance.
In the limited circumstances where the company cannot determine VSOE or TPE of
the selling price for all of the deliverables in the arrangement, including the
software deliverable, BESP is used for the purposes of performing this
allocation.
 
Financing
 
Financing income
attributable to sales-type leases, direct financing leases and loans is
recognized on the accrual basis using the effective interest method. Operating
lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 
Determination of Best Estimate of
Selling Price
 
In certain limited
instances, the company is not able to establish VSOE for all elements in a
multiple deliverable arrangement. When VSOE cannot be established, the company
attempts to establish the selling price of each element based on TPE. TPE is
determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold
separately.
 
When the company is unable to establish selling price
using VSOE or TPE, the company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement
consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the
company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a
stand-alone basis. Due to the fact that the company sells its products and
services on a stand-alone basis, and therefore has established VSOE for its
products and services offerings, the company expects to use BESP to determine
the relative selling price for a product or service in a multiple-deliverable
arrangement on an infrequent basis. An example of when BESP would be used is
when the company sells a new product, for which VSOE and TPE does not exist, in
a multiple deliverable arrangement prior to selling the new product on a
stand-alone basis. During the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010,
BESP was used in 8 and 17 transactions, respectively, and the effects of its
use were immaterial.
 
The company determines BESP
for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not
limited to, overall market conditions, including geographic or regional
specific market factors, competitive positioning, competitor actions, internal
costs, profit objectives and pricing practices. The determination of BESP is a
formal process within the company that includes review and approval by the
companys management. In addition, the company regularly reviews VSOE and TPE
for its products and services, in addition to BESP.
 
Effect of Adoption
 
For transactions entered
into prior to January 1, 2010, the company recognized revenue based on
established revenue recognition guidance as it related to the elements within
the arrangement. For the vast majority of the companys arrangements involving
multiple deliverables, the fee from the arrangement was allocated to each
respective element based on its relative fair value, using VSOE. In the limited
circumstances when the company was not able to determine VSOE for all of the
elements of the arrangement, but was able to obtain VSOE for any undelivered
elements, revenue was allocated using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equaled the total
arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered
elements, and no revenue was recognized until all elements without VSOE had
been delivered. If VSOE of any undelivered items did not exist, revenue from
the entire arrangement was initially deferred and recognized at the earlier of:
(i) delivery of those elements for which VSOE did not exist or (ii) when
VSOE was established. The residual method and recognition of revenue on a
ratable basis were generally used in circumstances where VSOE, as applicable,
was unavailable.
 
The new amended accounting
standards for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and changes to the
scope of existing software revenue recognition guidance if applied to
transactions in the year ended December 31, 2009 would not have resulted
in a material change to the companys reported revenue for that fiscal year
period.
 
10





Table

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
In addition, there would not
have been a material impact to revenue, as reported during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2010, if the transactions entered into or
materially modified on or after January 1, 2010 were subject to the
previous accounting guidance.
 
As discussed in Note 2, Accounting
Changes, on pages 7 and 8 there was no material impact in the third
quarter or the first nine months of 2010, respectively, from the adoption of
the amended revenue recognition guidance. In terms of the timing and pattern of
revenue recognition, the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition is not
expected to have a material impact on revenue in future periods.
 
See
the companys 2009 Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on
pages 70 and 71 and Critical Accounting Estimates, on pages 52 and
53 for additional information.
 
4. Fair
Value: Exit prices are used to measure assets and
liabilities that fall within the scope of the fair value measurements guidance.
Under this guidance, the company is required to classify certain assets and
liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:
 
·              Level 1Quoted prices in active markets that are
unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities;
·              Level 2Quoted prices for identical assets and
liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which
significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
·              Level 3Prices or valuations that require inputs
that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
 
The
guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available
without undue cost and effort.
 
When
available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair
value and classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
The
determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate
yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For
derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow
analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
In
determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers
certain market valuation adjustments to the base valuations calculated using
the methodologies described below for several parameters that market
participants would consider in determining fair value:
 
·                  Counterparty credit risk adjustments are
applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of
a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the
true fair value of such an instrument.
·                  Credit risk adjustments are applied to
reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at
fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing
counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit
risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
As
an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived by a discounted cash flow
model using observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts,
yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These
inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which
are available for the full term of the derivative.
 
Certain
financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These
assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair value at
the end of the period to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
These assets include public cost method investments that are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary
impairment of a financial investment, fair value is measured using a model
described above.
 
11





Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
Non-financial
assets such as property plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible
assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are
deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets
depend on the type of asset. See Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 70
to 79 in the 2009 Annual Report for further information. There were no material
impairments of non-financial assets for the nine months ended September 30,
2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively.
 
The
following tables present the companys financial assets and financial
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009.

5. Financial Instruments (excluding derivatives): Cash and cash
equivalents, debt and marketable equity securities are recognized and measured
at fair value in the companys consolidated financial statements. Notes and
other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with
carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued
expenses and short-term debt are financial liabilities with carrying values
that approximate fair value. In the absence of quoted prices in active markets,
considerable judgment is required in developing estimates of fair value.
Estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could
realize in a current market transaction. The following methods and assumptions
are used to estimate fair values:
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
Fair
values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates
offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same
remaining maturities.
 
Long-term Debt
 
Fair
value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for
the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other
long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected
present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair
value. The carrying amount of long-term debt is $21,899 million and $21,932
million and the estimated fair value is $24,404 million and $23,748 million at September 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Based
on an evaluation of available evidence as of September 30, 2010, the
company believes that unrealized losses on debt and marketable equity
securities are temporary and do not represent a need for an
other-than-temporary impairment.
 
Proceeds
from sales of debt securities and marketable equity securities were
approximately $1 million and $14 million for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2010, respectively. The gross realized gains (before taxes) on these
sales were less than $1 million and $5 million for the third quarter and first
nine months of 2010, respectively. The gross realized losses (before taxes) on
these sales were less than $1 million in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2010. Proceeds from the sales of debt securities and marketable
equity securities were approximately $12 million and $23 million in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively. The gross realized gains
(before taxes) on these sales totaled $2 million in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2009. The gross realized losses (before taxes) on these sales
totaled $19 million and $40 million in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2009, respectively. The company determines the cost of the securities sold
based on the specific identification method.
 
The
after tax net unrealized holding gains/(losses) on available-for-sale debt and
marketable equity securities that have been included in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) and the after tax net gains/(losses) reclassified
from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into net income were as

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing
leases is for leases that relate principally to the companys systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$803 million and $849 million at September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of $761 million and
$905 million and of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of $151 million
and $159 million at those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to
inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM
and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable
financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables are loans that are provided by
Global Financing primarily to clients to finance the purchase of  software and services. Separate contractual
relationships on these financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally
from two to seven years. Each financing contract is priced independently at
competitive market rates. The company has a history of enforcing the terms of
these separate financing agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing
receivables as collateral for non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables
pledged as collateral for borrowings were $278 million and $271 million at September 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of September 30, 2010
and December 31, 2009.
 
7. Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions: The company operates in multiple functional
currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In
the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest
rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity
and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these
risks by following established risk management policies and procedures,
including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with
debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate
exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the
interest rates associated with the companys lease and other financial assets
and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also
used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures,
derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from
foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of
derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties
to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To
mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy of only
entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions
based upon their credit ratings and other factors. The companys established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the
 
16





Table

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
arrangement to net amounts
due to and from the counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in
the event of  counterparty default. The company is also a party to collateral
security arrangements with most of its major counterparties.  These arrangements require the company to
hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative
fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can
be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a
liability position at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was
$326 million and $779 million, respectively, for which the company has posted
collateral of $21 million and $37 million, respectively. Full collateralization
of these agreements would be required in the event that the companys credit
rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread
exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the
collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of
derivative instruments in net asset positions as of September 30, 2010 and
December 31, 2009 was $1,503 million and $838 million, respectively. This
amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date as a
result of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. This exposure is
reduced by $480 million and $573 million at September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with
those counterparties. Additionally, at September 30, 2010, this exposure
is reduced by $323 million of collateral received by the company. The company does not offset derivative
assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset
receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral
against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. At September 30,
2010, $21 million was recognized in other receivables for the right to reclaim
cash collateral. At December 31, 2009, $37 million was recorded in prepaid
expenses and other current assets for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The
amounts recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash
collateral totaled $323 million at September 30, 2010. The company had no
obligation to return cash collateral at December 31, 2009. The company
restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation and therefore
reports it in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position. At September 30, 2010, $21 million was
rehypothecated.
 
The company may employ derivative
instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the
company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net
investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have
an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow
from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors the
cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these
hedging relationships by de-designating the derivative instrument to manage
this liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company
may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in fair value of the
de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
 
In its hedging programs, the
company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and
cross-currency swaps, depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is
not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
 
A brief description of the
major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate
Borrowings
 
The company issues debt in
the global capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan
portfolio. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate
mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce
overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges). At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
total notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps was $7.1 billion and
$9.1 billion, respectively.
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to
interest rate volatility on forecasted debt issuances. To manage this risk, the
company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the
interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at September 30, 2010 and
December 31, 2009.

Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign
Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
A large portion of the
companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge
of net investment to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major
foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses
cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk
management purpose. At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment
hedges was $2.8 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The weighted-average
remaining maturity of these instruments at September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009 was approximately 0.5 years and 1.6 years, respectively.
 
In
addition, at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the company
had liabilities of $262 million and $318 million, respectively, representing
the fair value of derivative instruments that were previously designated in
qualifying net investment hedging relationships but were de-designated prior to
September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively; of these
amounts $200 million and $94 million are expected to mature over the next
twelve months, respectively. The notional amount of these instruments at September 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009 was $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion,
respectively, including original and offsetting transactions.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost
Transactions
 
The companys operations
generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these
foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency
markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to
manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years.
At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total notional
amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted
royalty and cost transactions was $11.8 billion and $18.7 billion, with a
weighted-average remaining maturity of 0.8 years and 1.3 years, respectively.
 
Foreign Currency Denominated
Borrowings
 
The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to
convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt
denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the
company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is
approximately 3.3 years. At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow
hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion,
respectively.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign
Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its Global
Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers
principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective
manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to
economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion
of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of
these forward and swap contracts are generally less than two years. The changes
in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures
are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of
foreign currency exposure was $13.0 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively.
 
Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to
market price changes primarily related to certain obligations to employees.
These exposures are primarily related to market price movements in certain
broad market indices and in the companys own stock. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes
derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the
exposures related to its employee compensation
 
18

obligations. The derivatives
are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total
return on the companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value with
gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement
of Earnings. At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total
notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these
compensation obligations was $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
The company holds warrants
to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that
are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement
provisions. The amount of shares to be purchased under these agreements was
immaterial at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The company
records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The company is exposed to a
potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms.
The company utilizes credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit
exposures. These derivatives have terms of one year or less. The swaps are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any
derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at September 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009.
 
The tables on pages 20
to 23 provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative
instrument related risk management activity as of September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009 as well as for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2010 and 2009, respectively.

At
September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, in connection with cash
flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company
recorded net losses of $105 million and $1,335 million (before taxes),
respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these
amounts $267 million and $718 million of losses, respectively, are expected to
be reclassified to net income within the next twelve months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. At September 30,
2010 and September 30, 2009, net losses of approximately $15 million and
$19 million (before taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the companys
borrowings. Within these amounts, $9 million and $9 million of losses,
respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net income within the next
twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying
transactions.
 
For
the nine months ending September 30, 2010, and September 30, 2009,
there were no significant gains or losses recognized in earnings representing
hedge ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
(for fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying exposure that did not
or was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor are there any
anticipated in the normal course of business.
 
Refer
to the 2009 IBM Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies on pages 76
and 77 for additional information on the companys use of derivative
instruments.
 
8. Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based
compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service period.  The following table presents total
stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings:

Reflects the one-time effects of the sale of the Product Lifecycle Management
activities.
 
The
increase in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended September 30,
2010, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was
principally the result of an increase in restricted and performance-based stock
compensation costs ($9 million), partially offset by a reduction in stock
option compensation cost ($3 million). The increase in pre-tax stock-based
compensation cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was principally the
result of an increase related to restricted and performance-based stock
compensation costs ($76 million), partially offset by a reduction in stock
option compensation cost ($19 million).
 
As
of September 30, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,096
million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
 
There
were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at September 30,
2010 and 2009.
 
9. Segments:  The following tables reflect the results of
operations of the segments consistent with the companys management and
measurement system.  These results are
not necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP. Performance
measurement is based on pre-tax income. These results are used, in part, by
senior management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating
resources to, each of the segments.

The company received a $17.2
million subsidy in the third quarter of 2010 and a $38.3 million subsidy for
the first nine months of 2010 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by
the company to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the
remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the
participants. For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug
Act, see page 121 in the companys 2009 Annual Report.
 
12. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
Acquisitions: During the
nine months ended September 30, 2010, the company completed 11
acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $3,385 million.
 
Sterling Commerce - On August 27, 2010,
the company completed the acquisition of 100 percent of Sterling Commerce, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T, Inc., for cash consideration of
$1,415 million. Sterling Commerce will expand the companys ability to help
clients accelerate their interactions with customers, partners and suppliers
through dynamic business networks using either on-premise or cloud delivery
models. Sterling Commerce was integrated into the Software segment upon
acquisition, and goodwill, as reflected in the table on page 31, has been
entirely assigned to the Software segment. It is expected that none of the goodwill
will be deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted average useful life
of the intangible assets acquired, excluding goodwill, is 6.9 years.
 
Other acquisitions - The Software segment also completed acquisitions of
seven privately held companies: in the first quarter, Lombardi Software, Inc., Intelliden
Inc. and Initiate Systems, Inc.; in the second quarter, Cast Iron Systems;
and in the third quarter, BigFix, Inc., Coremetrics and Datacap. Global
Technology Services (GTS) completed one acquisition in the first quarter:  the core operating assets of Wilshire Credit
Corporation.  Global Business Services
(GBS) completed one acquisition in the first quarter:  National Interest Security Company, LLC, a
privately held company. Systems and Technology (STG) completed one acquisition
in the third quarter:  Storwize, a
privately held company.
 
Each
acquisition further complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of
product and services offerings.  Lombardi is a leading provider of
business process management software and services and became part of the
application integration software portfolio. Intelliden is a leading provider of
intelligent network automation software and will extend the  network management offerings. Initiate is a
market leader in data integrity software for information sharing among health
care and government organizations. Cast Iron Systems, the leading Software as a
Service (SaaS) and cloud application integration provider, enhances the
industry-leading WebSphere business integration software portfolio. BigFix, Inc.
is a leading provider of high-performance enterprise systems and security
management solutions that revolutionizes the way IT organizations manage and
secure their computing infrastructure. Coremetrics, a leader in web analytics
software, will expand the companys business analytics capabilities by enabling
organizations to use cloud computing services to develop faster, more targeted
marketing campaigns. Datacap will strengthen the companys ability to help
organizations digitize, manage and automate their information assets. Wilshires
mortgage servicing platform will continue the strategic focus on the mortgage
services industry and strengthens the commitment to deliver mortgage business
process outsourcing solutions. National Interest Security Company will
strengthen the ability to deliver advanced analytics and IT solutions to the
public sector. Storwize, a provider of in-line data compression appliance
solutions, will help the company to make it more affordable for clients to
analyze massive amounts of data in order to provide new insights and business
outcomes. Purchase price consideration for the Other Acquisitions as
reflected in the table on page 31, is paid primarily in cash. All
acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of
acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
The
table on page 31 reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions
and the resulting purchase price allocations as of September 30, 2010:

The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entities were recorded
at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items
that generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. For the Other Acquisitions, the
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 6.3 years. With the exception of goodwill, these identified
intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
lives. Goodwill of $1,435 million has been assigned to the Software ($1,057
million), GTS ($32 million), GBS ($252 million) and STG ($94 million) segments.
It is expected that approximately 15 percent of the goodwill will be deductible
for tax purposes.
 
On
September 20, 2010, the company announced that it had entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire Netezza, a publicly held company based in
Marlborough, MA, for approximately $1.7 billion (after adjusting for cash). Netezza
will expand the companys business analytics initiatives to help clients gain
faster insights into their business information, with increased performance at
a lower cost. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2010.
 
On
September 27, 2010, the company announced that it had entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire BLADE Network Technologies, a privately held
company based in Santa Clara, CA. BLADE specializes in software and devices
that route data and transactions to and from servers. The acquisition is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
On
October 6, 2010, the company announced that it had completed the
acquisition of Unica Corporation, a publicly-held software company based in
Waltham, MA. Unica is a leading global provider of enterprise marketing
management software designed to help businesses improve the efficiency,
execution and measurability of their marketing operations.
 
On
October 13, 2010, the company announced that it had completed the acquisition
of PSS Systems, a privately held company based in Mountain View, CA.  PSS Systems software helps organizations
analyze, automate and implement information governance policies across massive
amounts of electronic business information and dispose of that information in
an automated way.
 
On
October 21, 2010, the company announced that it had completed the
acquisition of OpenPages, a privately held company based in Waltham, MA. OpenPages provides
software that helps companies more easily identify and manage risk and
compliance activities across the enterprise through a single management system.
 
On
October 21, 2010, the company announced that it has completed the
acquisition of Clarity Systems, a privately held company based in Toronto,
Canada. Clarity Systems delivers financial governance software that enables
organizations to automate the process of collecting, preparing, certifying and
controlling financial statements for electronic filings, in support of mandates
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies.
 
At
the date of issuance of these financial statements, the initial purchase
accounting was not completed for the Unica Corporation, PSS Systems, OpenPages and
Clarity Systems acquisitions.

Divestitures: On
March 31, 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities
associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes (Dassault) product
lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related
assets to Dassault.  The company received
net proceeds of $459 million and recognized a net gain of $591 million on the
transaction in the first quarter of 2010. 
The gain was net of the fair value of certain contractual terms, certain
transaction costs and the assets and liabilities sold. The gain was recorded in
other (income) and expense on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and the
net proceeds are reflected in proceeds from disposition of marketable
securities and other investments within cash flow from investing activities on
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
 
On
March 16, 2009, the company completed the sale of certain processes,
resources, assets and third-party contracts related to its core logistics
operations to Geodis. The company received cash proceeds of $365 million and
recognized a net gain of $298 million on the transaction in the first quarter
of 2009.  The gain was net of the fair
value of certain contractual terms, certain transaction costs and related real
estate charges. As part of this transaction, the company outsourced its
logistics operations to Geodis which will enable the company to leverage
industry-leading skills and scale and improve the productivity of the companys
supply chain.

(a)   Other intangibles are primarily acquired
proprietary and non-proprietary business processes, methodologies and systems.
 
The net carrying amount of
intangible assets increased $534 million during the first nine months of 2010,
primarily due to acquired intangible asset additions, partially offset by
amortization. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $289 million
and $859 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively,
versus $313 million and $931 million for the third quarter and first nine
months ended September 30, 2009, respectively. In addition, in the first
nine months of 2010, the company retired $910 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.
 
The amortization expense for
each of the five succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be

15. Contingencies:  As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 170
countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety
of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings
that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The
company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has
been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its intellectual
property (IP)

rights
and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent
infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition,
the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license
negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBMs
scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various
jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including
matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the companys pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, partners, clients, current or former employees, government and
regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which
the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party
may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise
novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these
matters arise.
 
The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&Ts UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet
issued its decision. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy
protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed. On August 25,
2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved the
appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee of SCO. The court in another suit, the SCO
Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010. The
jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights; the judge
subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs
claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. In
July 2010, SCO filed an appeal in connection with this matter.
 
On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform
Solutions, Inc. (PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, alleging that PSI violated certain intellectual property
rights of IBM. PSI asserted counterclaims against IBM. On January 11,
2008, the court permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems,
to intervene as a counterclaim-plaintiff. T3 claimed that IBM violated certain
antitrust laws by refusing to license its patents and trade secrets to PSI and
by tying the sales of its mainframe computers to its mainframe operating
systems. On June 30, 2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a result of this
transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed all claims against each other, and PSI
withdrew a complaint it had filed with the European Commission in
October 2007 with regard to IBM. On September 30, 2009, the court
granted IBMs motion for summary judgment and dismissed T3s claims against
IBM. This decision has been appealed by T3. In January 2009, T3 filed a
complaint with the European Commission alleging that IBM violated European
Union competition law based on the facts alleged in the above-referenced U.S.
litigation involving T3. Complaints concerning competition matters were also
filed with the European Commission in March 2010 by TurboHercules SAS and
in late July 2010 by Neon Enterprise Software, LLC (Neon). IBM has been
notified that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating possible
antitrust violations by IBM, and the DOJ has requested certain information,
including the production of materials from the litigation between T3 and IBM.
In July 2010, the European Commission notified the company that it has
decided to initiate proceedings to further investigate IBM regarding possible
infringements of European Union competition law.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on December 14, 2009 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by Neon,
alleging that the company has interfered with Neons efforts to license its
zPrime software. It seeks damages and injunctive relief. In late
January 2010, IBM filed its answer to Neons complaint and asserted
counterclaims against Neon. The case is set for trial in June 2011.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on April 2, 2009 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by Acqis LLC, which
alleges that certain IBM products infringe certain patents relating generally
to modular computing devices. Acqis seeks damages and injunctive relief. The
case is set for trial in February 2011.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on February 5, 2010 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by
TecSec, Inc., which alleges that certain IBM products infringe certain
patents relating generally to encryption. TecSec seeks damages and injunctive
relief. A pretrial conference is scheduled for November 2010.

In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea
announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several
companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea
and LG electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005)
and had also charged employees of some of those entities with, among other
things, bribery of certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea
and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in
these matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM
employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM
were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different
times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance,
which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain government-controlled
entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since expired and when they were
in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling products and services to
business partners who sold to government-controlled entities in Korea. In
addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have both contacted the
company in connection with this matter. In March 2008, the company
received a request from the SEC for additional information.
 
The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in
the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages
in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion
of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which plaintiffs reside
or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from the release of
chemicals into the environment by the company at its former manufacturing and
development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek punitive damages
in an unspecified amount.
 
The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters include claims for taxes on the importation
of computer software. In November 2008, the company won a significant case
in the Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil, and
in late July 2009, the company received written confirmation regarding
this decision. The total potential amount related to the remaining matters for
all applicable years is approximately $600 million. The company believes it
will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful
indicator of liability.
 
The
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are reviewed at least
quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the impact and status
of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information pertinent to a
particular matter. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such
liabilities for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, were not material to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its experience, the company
believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters previously referred to
are not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters previously discussed. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of
these matters.
 
Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on the
Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of
the particular matter which may give rise to additional factors.

16. Commitments: The companys
extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of
$3,784 million and $3,576 million at September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $2,626 million and $2,788
million at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 
The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 
The company is a party to a
variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the
other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise
in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the
company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from
a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to
the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified
environmental matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual
obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment
by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically
allow the company to challenge the other partys claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the companys
payment, the companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in
terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had
a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.
 
In addition, the company
guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential
future payment under these financial guarantees was $85 million at September 30,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was not
material.

warranty contracts are presented in the following tables:

3.6 percent adjusted for currency
 
Within
the Management Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at
constant currency are made so that certain financial results can be viewed
without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby
facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial
results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period
activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency
conversion rate. This approach is based on the pricing currency for each
country, which is typically the functional currency.
 
In
the third quarter of 2010, the company continued the trend of improving
business performance, increasing constant currency revenue growth, expanding
margins and again delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. Diluted
earnings per share of $2.82 increased 18 percent versus the third quarter of
2009; this growth was on top of very strong performance in the prior year third
quarter, which was also up 18 percent year to year.  The company delivered
solid financial results while continuing to invest to drive future growth and
delivering strong shareholder returns.
 
Total
revenue increased 3.0 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the
third quarter of 2009. The revenue growth at constant currency was 2 points
better than the constant currency performance in the second quarter. Revenue
performance in the third quarter was driven by the companys growth markets,
Systems and Technology, Global Business Services and business analytics
offerings. Total revenue from the growth markets increased 15.7 percent (13
percent adjusted for currency) driven by the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India
and China) which increased 28.8 percent (26 percent adjusted for currency). In
the growth markets, the company has focused its investments on expanding into
new countries and new territories and building out the IT infrastructure in
these regions in support of economic growth. The company has prioritized 16
countries for investment beyond the BRICs. In the third quarter, together with
the BRICs, the Growth Markets 20 grew revenue 17 percent (13 percent adjusted
for currency) and the company had 32 countries within the growth markets that
increased revenue at a double-digit rate. Systems and Technology had its best
revenue growth in six years at 10.4 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency)
capitalizing on new product introductions and continued strong

growth
in System x, midrange Power Systems and Storage. Business analytics is a key
growth area for the company. In the third quarter, business analytics revenue
increased 14 percent compared to the prior year which contributed to strong
performance in Global Business Services. Global Business Services revenue
growth improved to 5.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency).
 
The
consolidated gross profit margin increased 0.2 points versus the third quarter
of 2009 to 45.3 percent driven by improved margins in Software, Systems and
Technology and Global Financing, partially offset by revenue mix. Gross profit
margin performance by segment and the impact to the consolidated gross margin
was as follows:

Pre-tax
income grew 7.0 percent and the pre-tax margin was 19.3 percent, an increase of
0.7 points versus the third quarter of 2009. Net income increased 11.7 percent
reflecting an improvement in the tax rate. The effective tax rate was 23.3
percent, compared with 26.5 percent in the prior year. Net income margin improved
1.1 points to 14.8 percent.
 
Diluted earnings per share improved
17.5 percent reflecting the growth in net income and the benefits of the common
stock repurchase program. In the third quarter, the company repurchased 28.0
million shares of its common stock. Diluted earnings per share of $2.82
increased $0.42 from the prior year driven by the following factors:
 



-
  Revenue increase at actual rates:


 


$


0.07


 




-
  Operating leverage:


 


$


0.21


 




-
  Common stock repurchases:


 


$


0.14


 



 
In the third quarter, the
improvement in earnings per share was driven by a combination of revenue
growth, operating leverage and an effective use of cash.
 
The company generated $4,551
million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $647
million compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven primarily by sales cycle
working capital ($467 million) and financing receivables ($443 million),
partially offset by the increase in net income ($375 million). Net cash used in
investing activities of $1,780 million decreased $557 million primarily due to
the net benefit of $2,600 million from purchases and sales of marketable
securities and other investments in the third quarter of 2010 versus 2009,
partially offset by increased acquisitions of $1,959 million. Net cash used in
financing activities of $3,455 million decreased $1,712 million compared to the
prior year primarily due to an increased net benefit associated with debt
($4,709 million), partially offset by higher payments to repurchase common
stock ($2,724 million), lower cash from other common stock transactions ($182
million) and increased dividend payments ($91 million).
 
Total Global Services
signings of $11,037 million decreased 6.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to the third quarter of 2009. Outsourcing signings declined
14.9 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency). Transactional signings
increased 4.3 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) driven by Global
Business Services (increased 7 percent). The company signed 10 deals larger
than $100 million in the third quarter of 2010. On October 8, 2010, the
company signed a significant outsourcing deal which would have increased total
signings to $12.7 billion and outsourcing signings would have increased 14
percent year-to-year, at constant currency, if this deal was included in the
third quarter total. The estimated Global Services backlog at actual currency
rates was $134 billion at September 30, 2010, flat, at both actual rates
and adjusted for currency,

In the first nine months of 2010, the company
delivered diluted earnings per share of $7.38, an increase of 15.0 percent
compared to the first nine months of 2009. Performance was consistent with
earnings per share growth of 15.9 percent in the first quarter, 12.5 percent in
the second quarter and 17.5 percent in the third quarter. The company continues
to demonstrate steady improvement in the business - in both revenue growth and
margin expansion. The company utilizes its strong profit and cash position to
invest and expand its base of opportunity while returning capital to its
shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.
 
Total revenue increased 3.4 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) compared to the first nine months of 2009. Revenue
performance in the companys key growth areas was strong. Revenue from the
growth markets increased 16.3 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) driven
by the BRIC countries which increased 24.8 percent (19 percent adjusted for
currency). Key branded middleware software increased 9.5 percent (9 percent
adjusted for currency). On a segment basis, Global Technology Services revenue
increased 2.7 percent (flat adjusted for currency), Global Business Services
3.0 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency), Software 4.2 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) and Systems and Technology 6.3 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency). Global Financing revenue declined 4.3 percent (6
percent adjusted for currency) versus the prior year.
 
The consolidated gross profit margin increased 0.2
points versus the first nine months of 2009 to 44.9 percent. Gross profit
margin performance by segment and the impact to the consolidated gross margin

Pre-tax
income grew 8.6 percent and the pre-tax margin was 18.0 percent, an increase of
0.9 points versus the first nine months of 2009. Net income increased 11.2
percent reflecting an improvement in the tax rate. The effective tax rate was
25.0 percent, compared with 26.8 percent in the prior year. Net income margin
improved 0.9 points to 13.5 percent.
 
Diluted earnings per share
improved 15.0 percent reflecting the growth in net income and the benefits of
the common stock repurchase program. In the first nine months of 2010, the
company repurchased 92.6 million shares of its common stock. Diluted earnings
per share of $7.38 increased $0.96 from the prior year driven by the following
factors:
 



-
  Revenue increase at actual rates:


 


$


0.22


 




-
  Operating leverage:


 


$


0.50


 




-
  Common stock repurchases:


 


$


0.25


 



 
In the first nine months,
the improvement in earnings per share was balanced with contribution from
revenue growth, operating leverage and an effective use of cash.
 
At September 30, 2010,
the balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong and are well-positioned
to support the companys objectives. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total
cash flows are highlighted below.
 
Total assets decreased
$1,848 million ($2,124 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009 driven by:
 
·     Decreases in total receivables ($3,494
million) and cash and marketable securities ($2,887 million), partially offset
by;
·     Increased goodwill ($2,513 million),
pension assets ($1,378 million), and intangible assets ($534 million).
 
The company had $11,086
million in cash and marketable securities at September 30, 2010.
 
Total liabilities decreased
$1,453 million ($1,539 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009 driven by:
 
·              Decreases in taxes
($918 million), pension and retiree benefits ($808 million), other liabilities
($454 million), and deferred income ($421 million), partially offset by;
·              Increased debt
($1,355 million).
 
Total equity of $22,359
million decreased $396 million from December 31, 2009 as a result of:
 
·              Increased
treasury stock ($11,464 million), partially offset by;
·              Higher retained
earnings ($7,196 million), common stock ($2,518 million), lower pension
adjustments ($559 million), decreased losses on cash flow hedge derivatives
($416 million) and higher foreign currency translation adjustments ($327
million).
 
The company generated
$12,754 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of
$1,571 million, compared to the first nine months of 2009, primarily driven by
financing receivables ($1,574 million), higher income tax payments ($800
million) and lower tax refunds in 2010 (approximately $600 million), partially
offset by an increase in net income ($963 million) and less deferred income
($496 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,425 million was
$191 million higher than the first nine months of 2009, primarily due to
increased acquisitions ($2,868 million), decreased cash from divestitures ($406
million) and higher capital investments ($327 million), partially offset by the
net benefit of $3,367 million from purchases and sales of marketable securities
and other investments in 2010 versus 2009. Net cash used in financing
activities of $10,569 million was $2,924 million lower, compared to the first
nine months of 2009, primarily due to an increased net benefit associated with
debt ($9,445 million) and higher receipts of cash from other

common stock transactions
($1,123 million), partially offset by higher payments to repurchase common
stock ($7,408 million) and increased dividend payments ($235 million).
 
In October 2010, the
company increased its expectation for 2010 to at least $11.40 in earnings per
diluted share for the full year.

The
workforce rebalancing charges recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and 2010
and the PLM and Geodis transactions impact the year-to-year results of the
companys reportable segments for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the
first nine months of 2009. Workforce rebalancing charges were incurred in every
segment in the first quarter of both years. The PLM transaction gain was
recorded in Software in the first quarter of 2010 and the Geodis transaction
gain was recorded in the following segments in the first quarter of 2009:
Global Technology Services ($81 million), Global Business Services ($46
million), Software ($106 million) and Systems and Technology ($64 million). In
the segment analysis below and in the Global Financing analysis on page 66,
each segments pre-tax income and pre-tax margin for the nine months ended September 30
is presented on an as reported basis and on a basis normalized for these
actions in both years to provide a better perspective of the underlying
operational performance of the segments.
 
Global Services
 
The Global Services segments, Global Technology
Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS) delivered combined revenue of
$14,067 million in the third quarter, an increase of 2.1 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) compared to the third quarter of 2009. Both segments had
sequential improvement in their year-to-year revenue growth rates at constant
currency compared to the second quarter. In the first nine months of 2010,
total Global Services revenue was $41,501 million, an increase of 2.8 percent
(1 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. The estimated Global Services
backlog at actual currency rates was $134 billion at September 30, 2010,
flat, at both actual rates and adjusted for currency, compared to the September 30,
2009 level and an increase of $5 billion (decrease of $2 billion adjusted for currency)
from June 30, 2010. The company experienced a very low level of erosion in
the backlog this quarter.

million and 3.0 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) to $13,465 million in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively, versus the third

revenue growth in many areas of the business with sequential improvement
compared to 2010 second quarter growth rates in both the major markets and the
growth markets, and across its key offerings of Core Consulting, Application
Management Services (AMS) Outsourcing and AMS Systems Integration. In the quarter,
GBS gained share overall as well as in consulting and held share in AMS.
Smaller deals are helping to drive near term revenue performance, particularly
in areas that help customers drive global integration, drive efficiency and
standardization, and deliver cost savings. GBS had good performance in its
growth initiatives, with revenue and transactional signings growth in the
growth markets and revenue growth of approximately 40 percent in business
analytics. With increased client demand for specific industry knowledge, GBS
has added 2,000 consultants in the last two quarters and now has over 7,000
dedicated consultants in its business analytics practice.

Global
Services Signings
 
Total Global Services signings of $11,037 million
decreased 6.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the third
quarter of 2009. Outsourcing signings declined 14.9 percent (14 percent
adjusted for currency). Transactional signings increased 4.3 percent (4 percent
adjusted for currency) driven by Global Business Services (increased 7 percent).
The company signed 10 deals larger than $100 million in the third quarter of
2010. On October 8, 2010, the company signed a significant outsourcing
deal which would have increased total signings to $12.7 billion and outsourcing
signings would have increased 14 percent year-to-year, at constant currency, if
this deal was included in the third quarter. A large contract signing on October 8
versus a signing the last week of the third quarter has no real impact on the
following quarters revenue dynamics. The company expects to yield the same
amount of revenue in the fourth quarter with a signing on October 8 as it
would have if the deal had signed on September 30. Within the companys
outsourcing, longer-term business, at the beginning of a quarter, revenue is
more determined by backlog, and signings are just one of several inputs to
backlog. Outsourcing revenue is more closely tied to backlog than signings as
this is a more stable, annuity-like business. The estimated Global Services
backlog at actual currency rates was $134 billion at September 30, 2010,
flat, at both actual rates and adjusted for currency, compared to the September 30,
2009 level and an increase of $5 billion (decrease of $2 billion adjusted for
currency) from June 30, 2010.
 
The following table presents Global Services
signings. Outsourcing signings include GTS Outsourcing and Application
Management Services Outsourcing. Transactional signings include Integrated
Technology Services, Consulting and AMS Systems Integration.

Global Services signings are managements initial
estimate of the revenue value of a clients commitment under a Global Services
contract. Signings are used by management to assess period performance of
Global Services management. There are no third-party standards or requirements
governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management
involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment,
including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of
termination charges or wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS Outsourcing, ITS and GBS
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new revenue value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS and
Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under
contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject
to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes
in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not
materialized and adjustments for currency.
 
Contract portfolios
purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments
provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed
incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

revenue increased 0.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) to $5,151
million in the third quarter and increased 4.2 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) to $15,447 million in the first nine months of 2010, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2009. Adjusting for the divested PLM
operations, revenue grew at 6 percent, adjusted for currency, in the third
quarter of 2010, in line with the adjusted second quarter growth rate. For the
first nine months, excluding PLM, revenue increased 6 percent, adjusted for
currency, compared to the prior year. Revenue growth continues to be led by the
key areas of business analytics, storage management and business integration.

partner marketplace, had
strong double digit revenue growth in the third quarter. With the recent
acquisitions of Sterling Commerce, Coremetrics and Unica Corporation, the
company expects continued market momentum in this area.
 
Information Management
revenue increased 5.2 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and 7.7 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine
months of 2010, respectively. Relational Database revenue increased 4 percent
(5 adjusted for currency), in the third quarter driven primarily by growth in
distributed database of 5 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency).
Information Management provides the foundation for the companys business
analytics and optimization offerings. The software business continues to expand
its Information Management capabilities both organically and through
acquisitions. In October 2010, the OpenPages, PSS Systems and Clarity Systems
acquisitions closed. The Netezza acquisition is expected to close in the fourth
quarter of 2010.
 
Lotus revenue decreased 0.4
percent as reported but returned to modest growth (1 percent) adjusted for
currency in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009. In the
first nine months of 2010, Lotus revenue decreased 2.0 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) year to year.
 
Tivoli revenue increased 9.2
percent and 16.6 percent (11 percent and 16 percent adjusted for currency) year
over year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively.
Tivoli provides an integrated approach to service management. In the third
quarter, two elements of the companys Integrated Service management strategy
had solid revenue growth. Storage management was up 20 percent and security was
also up double digits.
 
Rational revenue decreased 0.3 percent as reported
but increased 1 percent adjusted for currency and gained share in the third
quarter of 2010. In the first nine months of 2010, Rational revenue increased
2.4 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the first nine months
of 2009.
 
Other software revenue decreased
23.8 percent (23 percent adjusted for currency) and 14.8 percent (16 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010,
respectively, due primarily to the divestiture of PLM in the first quarter of
2010.

Systems
and Technology revenue increased 10.4 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) and 6.3 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively, versus the same periods in
2009. Third quarter revenue performance was the best in six years and was
driven by double-digit growth in System z, midrange Power Systems, System x,
Microelectronics and Storage disk products. In the third quarter, Systems and
Technology had very strong performance in the growth markets, which grew 26
percent (25 percent adjusted for currency). BRIC countries grew 43 percent with
double-digit growth in all brands.
 
System z revenue increased 15.3 percent
(17 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and declined 8.4
percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) for the first nine months of 2010
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively.
Third-quarter performance was driven by a new mainframe product introduction
and strong performance in the growth markets. MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) shipments increased 54 percent and 5 percent in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2010 versus the third quarter and first nine
months of 2009, respectively. The third quarter MIPS performance was the
highest growth in six years. Late in the third quarter the company shipped the
zEnterprise 196 server, which delivers 40 percent more performance than the
z10. This performance is driven by the worlds fastest processor which operates
at more than 5 gigahertz. In the fourth quarter the company will begin shipping
the zBX, its first System of Systems. zBX extends mainframe governance to
select Power7 and System x blades.
 
Power Systems revenue
decreased 12.8 percent and 13.1 percent (13 percent and
14 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2010 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2009,
respectively. Although revenue declined in the periods, Power Systems continued
to be the market leader by a wide margin. The decreases were primarily driven
by high-end servers. The company first introduced Power7 into the midrange
systems during the first quarter of 2010. In the third quarter, midrange
systems revenue increased 11 percent, and for the first nine months of 2010, midrange
increased 7 percent. In mid-September, the company began to ship Power7 in the
high-end and entry systems. As a result of just two weeks of general
availability, shipments were limited in the third quarter. The companys

outs continued in the third
quarter, as over 250 competitive UNIX displacements drove approximately $225
million of business.
 
System x revenue increased
30.5 percent and 32.1 percent (31 percent and 31 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively,
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. This is the fourth
consecutive quarter of year-to-year revenue growth of 30 percent or better for
the brand. High-end System x revenue increased 27 percent and 18 percent in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2010 versus the comparable periods of
2009, respectively, while total server revenue increased 30 and 32 percent for
the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 versus the same periods in
2009, respectively. System x blades revenue increased 12 percent and 24 percent
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 versus the third quarter and
first nine months of 2009, respectively.
 
Storage
revenue increased 7.2 percent and 7.3 percent (8 percent and 7
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2010, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2009. Total disk revenue
increased 14 percent in both the third quarter and the first nine months of
2010 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively.
These increases were driven by continued strength in high-end storage: XIV and
DS8000. XIV added over 130 new customers in the third quarter and revenue
nearly doubled versus the third quarter of 2009. Tape revenue declined 8
percent and 9 percent in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010,
respectively, versus the comparable periods of 2009. Storage performance across
both hardware and software grew 10 percent in the third quarter.
 
Microelectronics OEM revenue
increased 27.7 percent and 23.0 percent (28 percent and 23 percent adjusted for
currency), respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010
versus the comparable periods of 2009, respectively. The company had strong
revenue growth from its OEM customers in networking and wireless communications
infrastructure in the third quarter.
 
Retail Stores Solutions
revenue was essentially flat and increased 20.9 percent (1 percent and 21
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of

Gross margin increased 1.2
points in the third quarter of 2010 versus the prior year. The increase was
driven by improved margins in Microeletronics (2.5 points), System x (0.7
points) and Storage (0.4 points) partially offset by a decline due to revenue
mix (1.2 points) and lower margins in Power Systems (1.0 points) and System z
(0.4 points). The gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 was
essentially flat compared to the first nine months of 2009. The gross margin
was impacted by revenue mix (3.3 points), margin declines in Power Systems (0.8
points) and System z (0.3 points), partially offset by margin improvements in
Microelectronics (2.1 points), System x (1.2 points), Storage (0.4 points) and
Retail Stores Solution (0.2 points).

Revenue from the major
markets decreased 0.8 percent (increased 1 percent adjusted for currency) year
to year in the third quarter of 2010. The growth rate improved 1 point
sequentially compared to the second quarter, at constant currency, with
significant improvement in Canada, France, Germany and Italy. In addition, the
U.K. continued to deliver strong year to year revenue performance, at constant
currency. Revenue from the growth markets increased 15.7 percent (13 percent
adjusted for currency); adjusted for currency, revenue growth outpaced the
major markets by 12 points in the quarter. In the BRIC countries, which
represented approximately 40 percent of the growth markets revenue in the
quarter, revenue increased 28.8 percent (26 percent adjusted for currency),
with strong growth in each of the four countries.
 
The company has been
investing in growth markets to expand into new regions and build out the IT
infrastructure in support of economic growth. As part of its market expansion
strategy, the company has prioritized 16 countries for investment beyond the
BRIC countries. Together with the BRICs, the Growth Markets 20 had revenue
growth of 17 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter,
and 32 countries within the growth markets had double-digit revenue growth,
adjusted for currency. Systems & Technology revenue within the growth
markets increased 26 percent (25 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter, with constant currency growth in servers of almost 30 percent
reflecting the benefit of the IT infrastructure work. Focusing on industry
leadership, the company has been investing in specific skills by both hiring
and deepening its employee skill sets in selected industries that are most
relevant in the growth markets. In the third quarter of 2010, the combined
revenue growth in the banking, energy and utilities, healthcare, transportation
and rail, and natural resources industries was 26 percent (21 percent adjusted
for currency) with four of the five industries having double-digit growth.

The companys
expense-to-revenue ratio improved in both the third quarter and on a
year-to-date basis versus the comparable periods in 2009. The increase in total
expense and other income in both periods was primarily driven by the companys
acquisitions. 
 
Operational expense improved
by 1 point and 4 points, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010,
respectively, when compared to the prior year. The company has had an ongoing
focus on increasing efficiency and driving productivity across the business 
this was the 9th consecutive quarter of operational expense
improvement. Savings from productivity initiatives result in improved
profitability and enabled investments in key growth areas.
 
Examples of the companys
investments include:
 
·                  Industry sales
skills to support Smarter Planet
·                  Sales
capabilities for business analytics, including the establishment of eight
analytics solution centers
·                  Development,
sales and marketing to support new high-end technology solutions
·                  Sales resources
and sales enablement to drive growth market performance

Total
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased
2.7 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2010
versus the third quarter of 2009. Overall, the increase was driven by
acquisition-related spending (3 points) as the company has been investing in
acquisitions to build its skills and technology in support of its growth
initiatives. This higher level of acquisition expense was partially offset by
currency (down 1 point). In the third quarter, operational SG&A expense in
the growth markets, excluding currency and acquisitions increased 7 percent
year to year, while overall operational SG&A was flat.
 
Total
SG&A expense increased 3.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first nine months of 2010 versus the first nine months of 2009. Overall,
the increase was driven by currency impacts (2 points) and acquisition-related
spending (2 points), partially offset by a decline in operational expense (1
point). Workforce reductions expense increased $231 million due primarily to
actions taken by the company in the first quarter of 2010, with the majority of
the spending in Europe and Asia Pacific. Bad debt expense decreased $89 million
reflecting the improving credit environment. The accounts receivable provision
coverage at September 30, 2010 is 2.2 percent, flat from the prior year and an
increase of 20 basis points from year-end 2009.

Other (income) and expense
was income of $106 million and expense of $5 million in the third quarter of
2010 and 2009, respectively. In the third quarter of 2010, foreign currency
rate volatility drove increased gains on derivative instruments ($425 million)
and higher foreign currency transaction losses ($419 million) versus the prior
year. In addition, the company had a net gain ($57 million) associated with the
disposition of a joint venture in the third quarter of 2010, and losses on
certain investments in the prior year.
 
Other (income) and expense
was income of $746 million and $326 million for the first nine months of 2010
and 2009, respectively. The increase in income for the first nine months of
2010 was primarily driven by the net gain from the PLM transaction in the first
quarter of 2010 ($591 million) reflected in Other in the table above, a net
gain associated with the disposition of a joint venture in third quarter of
2010 ($57 million) versus a gain from the divestiture of the core logistics
operations to Geodis in the first quarter of 2009 ($298 million), a provision
for losses related to a joint venture investment ($119 million) recorded in the
second quarter 2009 and higher gains on derivative instruments ($136 million).
These items were partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction losses
($250 million) versus the prior year.

The increase in interest
expense for the third quarter of 2010 versus the same period in 2009 was
primarily driven by higher average debt. The decline in interest expense for
the first nine months of 2010 versus the first nine months of 2009 was
primarily driven by lower average debt. Interest expense is presented in cost
of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related
external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. See page 70
for additional information regarding Global Financing debt and interest
expense. Overall interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months
of 2010 was $226 million and $687 million, respectively, a decrease of $31
million and $182 million, respectively, year to year.

In the third quarter, total
retirement-related plan cost decreased by $13 million compared to the third
quarter of 2009, primarily driven by lower cost of defined benefit plans of $16
million. Total cost for the first nine months of 2010 decreased $38 million
versus the first nine months of 2009 driven by decreases in the cost of defined
contribution plans of $26 million and defined benefit plans of $12 million.
 
As discussed in the Looking
Forward section on pages 61 to 63, the company has begun to characterize
certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating.
Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the
third quarter were $438 million, a reduction of $29 million compared to the
third quarter of 2009, driven by a $28 million reduction in total service cost.
Non-operating costs/(income) of ($104 million) decreased $16 million in the
third quarter compared to the prior year driven primarily by an increase in
recognized actuarial losses of $33 million and lower expected return on plan assets
of $40 million, partially offset by lower interest costs of $60 million. For
the first nine months of 2010, operating retirement-related costs were $1,354
million, a decrease of $106 million compared to the first nine months of 2009.
This decrease was driven by a $65 million reduction in total service cost and a
$26 million reduction in the cost of defined contribution plans. Non-operating
costs/(income) of ($293 million) decreased $68 million in the first nine months
compared to the prior year driven primarily by an increase in recognized
actuarial losses of $110 million, a $30 million reduction in expected return of
plan assets and a $23 million increase in curtailment settlement charges, partially
offset by lower interest cost of $103 million.
 
See Note 11, Retirement-Related
Benefits on pages 28 to 30 for additional plan cost detail.

Taxes
 
The effective tax rate
for the third quarter of 2010 was 23.3 percent versus an effective tax rate of
26.5 percent for the third quarter of 2009. The effective tax rates for the
first nine months of 2010 and 2009 were 25.0 percent and 26.8 percent,
respectively. The decrease in the rate for the third quarter and for the first
nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the prior year periods,
was primarily due to more favorable mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions
and an increase in foreign tax credit benefits.
 
With limited exception,
the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2003. The years
subsequent to 2003 contain matters that could be subject to differing
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount
and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of
tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of
tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to
result for these years. 
  
       The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2009 increased by $1,236 million for the first nine months of 2010 to $6,026
million. During the first quarter of 2010, the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits had decreased by $410 million, primarily driven by a payment of $370
million on an assessment received related to a foreign audit. Additionally, the
company had certain foreign tax loss carryforwards that had not been reflected
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. In April 2010, the
company decided to seek benefit for these losses and appeal the assessment
mentioned above. The second quarter increase of $1,412 million in unrecognized
tax benefits included $1,320 million related to this item. The amount of
unrecognized tax benefits increased by $234 million during the third quarter of
2010. The total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate
is $5,446 million at September 30, 2010.
 
The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2006
and 2007 in the first quarter of 2009. The company anticipates that the final
settlement of the 2006-2007 IRS audit will be completed by the end of 2010. In
the fourth quarter of 2008, the company was unable to reach agreement with the
IRS related to valuation matters associated with the intercompany transfer of
certain intellectual property in 2005. See the companys 2009 Annual Report on page 103
for additional information. The company believes it may be able to reach a
resolution with the IRS by the end of 2010 on this matter.

Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.  Diluted
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options and stock awards.

Actual shares outstanding at
September 30, 2010 were 1,242.4 million. The weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the third quarter and
first nine months of 2010 was 65.5 million and 44.5 million lower,
respectively, than the same periods in 2009 primarily as a result of the

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At September 30, 2010,
the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. Cash on hand
at quarter end was $9,859 million, with cash and marketable securities of
$11,086 million. Total debt of $27,455 million increased $1,355 million from
prior year-end levels. The commercial paper balance at September 30, 2010
was $1,600 million, an increase of $1,365 million from year end. The company
continues to have substantial flexibility in the market. In the third quarter,
the company issued $1,500 million of three-year bonds with a 1.0 percent
interest rate. In the first nine months, the company generated $12,754 million
in cash from operations, a decrease of $1,571 million compared to the first nine
months of 2009 (see cash flow analysis on page 59). The company has
consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have
access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its
$10 billion global credit facility. The companys strong cash flow and
substantial cash position permits the company to invest and deploy capital to
areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.
 
The assets and debt

Working
capital decreased $3,908 million from the year-end 2009 position. The key
changes are described below:
 
Current
assets decreased $4,467 million ($4,477 million adjusted for currency), driven
by:
 
·                  A decline of $2,296 million in short-term
receivables primarily due to collections of higher year-end balances; and
 
·                  A decline of $2,324 million in cash and cash
equivalents (see cash flow analysis below).
 
Current
liabilities decreased $559 million ($814 million adjusted for currency) as a
result of:
 
·                  A decrease of $918 million in taxes payable
primarily due to foreign tax payments,
 
·                  A decrease
of  $477 million in other accrued
expenses and liabilities mainly due to a decrease of $145 million in derivative
liabilities as a result of changes in foreign currency rates primarily for
instruments in cash flow hedging relationships and reductions in restructuring
liabilities ($154 million), and
 
·                  A decrease in
accounts payable of $352 million and a decrease in deferred income of $346
million; partially offset by
 
·                  An increase in short-term debt of $1,388
million primarily driven by:
 
·                  a net increase of $1,365 million in
commercial paper and $2,924 million in new debt issuances; and

Global Financing provides
financing predominantly for the companys external client assets as well as for
assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global
Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global
Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services
assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The
debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 69.
 
Given the significant
leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes
Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is more
representative of the companys core business operations. This ratio can vary
from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt
positions.
 
Core
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
22.1 percent at September 30, 2010 compared to 16.0 percent at December 31,
2009. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in non-Global Financing
debt of $1,741 million and a decrease in non-Global Financing equity of $345
million from December 31, 2009 balances.
 
Consolidated debt-to-capitalization
ratio at September 30, 2010 was 55.1 percent versus 53.4 percent at December 31,
2009.
 
Equity
 
Total equity decreased $396
million primarily as a result of an increase in treasury stock of $11,464
million, driven by common stock repurchases in the first nine months of 2010,
partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $7,196 million, an
increase of $2,518 million in common stock, lower pension adjustment of $559
million and decreased losses on cash flow hedge derivatives of $416 million.
 
Looking Forward
 
Looking forward, the company
will continue to transform the business by executing its strategy to shift to
higher-value areas, improving operating leverage through productivity and
investing where management sees the best long-term opportunities. This
transformation delivered solid performance in the first nine months of 2010 and
continues to position the company for growth going forward. 
 
In January 2010, the
company disclosed that it expected earnings of at least $11.00 per diluted
share for the full year 2010, with consistent earnings per share growth
throughout the year. In April 2010, the company increased its expectation
for 2010 to at least $11.20 in earnings per diluted share for the full year.
 
In May 2010, the company met
with investors and analysts and provided an update on its 2010 earnings per
share roadmap. At that time, the company reiterated its expectation of at least
$11.20 in earnings per diluted share for 2010.
 
61





Table of Contents
 
Management
Discussion  (continued) 
 
In July 2010, the
company again increased its expectation for 2010 to at least $11.25 in earnings
per diluted share for the full year. In October 2010, the company raised
its projection for diluted earnings per share to at least $11.40 for 2010, an
increase of $0.15 since July, and a 13.9 percent increase compared to 2009.
 
In the third quarter of
2010, the company continued its trend of improving business performance - in
both revenue growth and margin expansion. From a geographic perspective, all
three geographies plus the major markets and growth markets improved their
year-to-year revenue growth rates at constant currency compared to the second
quarter. The company had outstanding performance in the growth markets with
15.7 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) growth as the company continues
to execute its market expansion plans. The company expects performance in the
growth markets to continue to outpace the major markets and to continue to grow
faster than the market overall.
 
From a segment perspective,
performance in the quarter was led by Systems and Technology and Global
Business Services, which increased 10.4 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) and 5.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), respectively,
compared to the third quarter of 2009. On a constant currency basis, all segments,
excluding Software, improved their year-to-year revenue growth rates in the
third quarter compared to the second quarter. Software, excluding the divested
PLM operations, maintained its growth rate at constant currency (6 percent)
from the prior quarter. The Software segment delivered solid performance again
in the third quarter and is well-positioned entering the fourth quarter. The
company expects the Software revenue growth rate, at constant currency,
excluding PLM, to improve in the fourth quarter compared to the second and
third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Systems and Technology segment will
begin shipping the zBX - the companys first System of Systems. zBX extends
mainframe governance to select Power7 and System x blades products. In addition,
the company will have a full quarter of availability for products introduced
late in the third quarter: the zEnterprise 196 server and the Power Systems
high end and entry Power7 products. The company expects Systems and Technology
to deliver revenue growth, at constant currency, in the fourth quarter similar
to its strong performance in the third quarter (11 percent). Within Global
Services, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, at constant currency, the
company expects Global Technology Services revenue growth to be consistent with
the third quarter (1 percent) and Global Business Services to continue its
strong performance similar to the third quarter (5 percent). Overall, in the
fourth quarter, the company expects its revenue growth rate, at constant
currency, to be consistent with third quarter performance (4 percent), with
Software providing more opportunity.
 
The company expects 2010
pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $1.5 billion versus
$1,415 million in 2009. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions
and the impacts of recent non-U.S. pension plan redesign efforts. See the
companys 2009 Annual Report, note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, on pages 109
through 121 for additional information.
 
The company expects in the
normal course of business that its effective tax rate in 2010 will be
approximately 25.0 percent. The rate will change period to period based on
non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes
in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of
income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
In May 2010, the
company met with investors and analysts and discussed changes that it is making
to the way the company will report on its performance and introduced a new road
map for earnings per share in 2015.
 
In an effort to provide better
transparency into the operational results of the business, beginning in 2011,
the company will separate business results into operating and non-operating
categories. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects
of certain acquisition-related charges and retirement-related costs, and their
related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings will exclude the
amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable
restructuring and related expenses and tax charges related to acquisition
integration. In the technology sector, it is common practice to provide
earnings information on a non-GAAP basis that excludes acquisition-related items.
Within retirement-related, given the significant impact that the debt and
equity markets can have on the companys retirement-related costs and the fact
that these market forces are not under direct management control and are
non-operational, the company has characterized certain items as operating and
others as non-operating. The company will include defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost, amortization of prior
service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings.
Non-operating retirement-related cost will include defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan
assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the
impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and multi-employer/pension

insolvency/other costs.
These costs are primarily those related to changes in pension plan assets and
liabilities which are tied to market performance and the company considers
these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business.
 
Overall, the company
believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings beginning
in 2011 will provide better transparency and clarity into both the operational
results of the business and the impact to the company of the performance of the
companys pension plans; improve visibility to management decisions and their
impacts on operational performance; enable better comparison to peer companies;
and, allow the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business
going forward. There will be no changes to balance sheet or cash flow presentation.
The company will provide this view of its performance in addition to its GAAP
reporting.
 
For the 2015 road map, the
company will utilize operating earnings to establish its objectives and track
its progress. The companys 2015 road map continues to focus on the key
financial drivers of long term earnings per share growth. The company will
continue to leverage its base business model for revenue growth by entering new
markets and launching new offerings and products, both organically developed
and acquired. The company will remain focused on margin expansion through
productivity and portfolio management. The company will deploy cash to fund
growth initiatives and provide returns to shareholders through dividends and
common stock repurchases. This road map results in an operating earnings per
share objective of at least $20 per share for 2015.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At September 30, 2010, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at
year-end 2009. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific
currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears
in the 2009 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions,
on pages 92 through 96.
 
In the first nine months of
2010, the companys revenue increased 3.4 percent as reported and 1.7 percent
adjusted for currency. In the third quarter, revenue increased 3.0 percent as
reported and 3.6 percent adjusted for currency. These currency differences were
driven from the companys operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
The company maintains currency hedging programs for cash planning purposes
which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the
companys financial results. In addition to the translation of earnings, the impact
of currency changes also may affect the companys pricing and sourcing actions.
For example, the company may procure components and supplies in multiple
functional currencies and sell products and services in other currencies. The
company believes that some of these currency-based changes in cost impacts the
price charged to clients. However, the company estimates that the maximum
effect of currency, before taking pricing or sourcing actions into account, and
net of hedging activity, decreased total diluted earnings per share growth by
approximately $0.05 in the third quarter of 2010 and $0.17 in the first nine
months of 2010.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by
linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. The company continues to monitor
the economic conditions in Venezuela. In Venezuela, there are official currency
rates that are fixed by the government and a parallel market of currency
exchange that enables companies to obtain foreign currency, including U.S.
dollars. The parallel rate is variable and may differ significantly from the official
rates. Accounting guidance requires that the translation of a non-U.S. entitys
financial statements into the companys consolidated financial statements be at
the rate applicable to dividend remittances. Due to the significant reduction
of currency approvals by the Venezuela government, in December 2009, the
company determined that the rate for translation should be changed to the
parallel rate at December 31, 2009.
 
In addition, due to the fact
that the blended CPI/NCPI three year cumulative inflation rate in Venezuela
reached 100 percent, the country was considered highly inflationary, consistent
with accounting standards, effective January 1, 2010.
 
On January 8, 2010, a
devaluation of the Venezuelan currency was announced. The currency market in
Venezuela will continue to be fully controlled by the government through the
Central Bank. A two-tiered official rate structure was implemented and will be
managed by the Central Bank. In the first quarter of 2010, the ability to
obtain U.S. dollars remained severely restricted, even at the new devalued
rates. The parallel market remained the primary method to obtain U.S. dollars.
Therefore, in the first quarter, the company continued to remeasure utilizing
the parallel rate.
 
On May 17, 2010, the parallel market was
suspended by the Venezuela government. The new parallel fluctuating market (SITME)
opened on June 9, 2010, controlled by the Central Bank, and with a set daily
trading rate band that was

Discussion  (continued) 
 
significantly lower than the previous parallel market
rate. Tight volume restrictions have been established for the new banded
market, which has been thinly traded since being opened. The SITME market is
the current viable option for obtaining currency exchange as the official rates
have not been accessible. Therefore, in the second and third quarters, the
company utilized the banded rate for remeasurement purposes. This resulted in
the recording of an immaterial gain in the second quarter.
 
Future gains or losses from changes in the banded rate
are not expected to have a material impact given the size of the companys
operations in Venezuela (less than 1 percent of total 2008 and 2009 revenue).
 
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
In the companys 2009 Annual
Report, on pages 49 through 51, there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table
presented on page 49 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and
marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities
for each of the past five years. For the nine months ended, or as of, as
applicable, September 30, 2010, those amounts are $12.8 billion for net
cash from operating activities, $11.1 billion of cash and marketable securities
and $10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The major rating agencies
ratings on the companys debt securities at September 30, 2010 appear in
the table below and remain unchanged from December 31, 2009. The companys
debt securities do not contain any acceleration clauses which could change the
scheduled maturities of the obligation. In addition, the company does not have ratings
trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow
the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments
thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual
agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses
which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit
rating were to fall below investment grade. At September 30, 2010, the
fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $981
million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to
fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys
outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other
contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would
result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable
accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 6 of this
Form 10-Q and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of
cash in that format on pages 59 and 60. The following is managements
view of cash flows for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009 prepared in a
manner consistent with the table and description on pages 49 and 50

Discussion  (continued) 
 
Free cash flow for the first
nine months of 2010 decreased $281 million versus the first nine months of
2009. The decline year to year was primarily driven by higher capital
investments ($284 million) and a year-to-year impact for tax refunds
(approximately $600 million), partially offset by higher net income and sales
cycle working capital improvements. Also, in the first nine months of 2010,
$14,142 million was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and
dividends.
 
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the
2009 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 15, Contingencies,
on pages 33 to 35 of this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $900 million in 2010. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.
 
Global Financing
 
Global Financing is a
reportable segment that is measured as if it were a standalone entity.
Accordingly, the information presented in this section is consistent with this
separate company view.  The mission of
Global Financing is to facilitate clients acquisition of IBM systems, software
and services with the objective of generating consistently strong returns on
equity.

The
increase in revenue in the third quarter, as compared to the same period in
2009, was primarily due to:
 
·                  An increase in internal revenue of 3.2
percent driven by increases in financing revenue (up 2.9 percent to $140
million) and in used equipment sales (up 3.4 percent to $293 million) primarily
to the Global Technology Services segment; partially offset by
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 1.3 percent
(1 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in financing revenue (down
8.2 percent to $384 million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment
sales (up 23.3 percent to $144 million).
 
The
increase in internal financing revenue was primarily due to higher average
asset balances. The decrease in external financing revenue was primarily due to
lower asset yields.
 
The
decrease in revenue in the first nine months, as compared to the same period in
2009, was primarily due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 4.3 percent
(6 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in financing revenue (down
8.6 percent to $1,184 million), partially offset by an increase in used
equipment sales (up 10.3 percent to $426 million); partially offset by
 
·                  An increase in internal revenue of 0.9
percent driven by an increase in used equipment sales (up 3.0 percent to $846
million) to the Global Technology Services segment, partially offset by a
decrease in financing revenue (down 3.1 percent to $421 million).

Table of Contents
 
Management
Discussion  (continued) 
 
The
decrease in external and internal financing revenue was due to both lower
average asset balances and lower asset yields.
 
Gross
profit increased 9.4 percent in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same
period in 2009, with gross margin increasing 5.2 points. Gross profit increased
3.3 percent in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the prior year, with
gross margin increasing 3.4 points. The gross profit increase in both periods
was due to an increase in sales gross profit. The margin improvement in both
periods reflects the interest rate environment and higher margins on used
equipment sales.
 
Pre-tax
income increased 23.2 percent and 13.0 percent versus the third quarter and
first nine months of 2009, respectively. The increase in the third quarter was
primarily driven by the increase in gross profit of $54 million and lower
financing receivables provisions of $43 million. The increase in the first nine
months was driven by the increase in gross profit of $60 million and lower
financing receivables provisions of $113 million, partially offset by an
increase in other expenses of $13 million. The decrease in financing
receivables provisions in both periods was primarily due to lower specific
reserve requirements. Excluding $2 million and $5 million of workforce
rebalancing charges in the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively,
pre-tax income on a normalized basis increased 12.6 percent for the first nine
months of 2010 versus the prior year period.
 
Pre-tax
margins of 52.3 percent and 48.4 percent increased 9.6 points and 6.4 points
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively. Pre-tax
margins on a normalized basis were 48.5 percent and 42.2 percent for the first
nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
The
increases in return on equity for the third quarter and for the first nine
months of 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 were driven by both higher
after-tax income and a lower average equity balance.

Discussion  (continued) 
 
Sources
and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds in
Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets. Client
financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and
services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM
clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for systems products as well
as loans for systems, software and services with terms generally from two to
seven years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and
services and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit
analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions
are taken to mitigate risks in the loan agreements which include covenants to
protect against credit deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client
financing also includes internal activity as described on page 24 of the
2009 IBM Annual Report.
 
Commercial financing
receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing
for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory
financing and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90
days.  These short-term receivables are
primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit analysis in
order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
At
September 30, 2010, substantially all financing assets are IT related
assets, and approximately 65 percent of the external portfolio is with
investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers or mortgage
assets.

Total
new financing originations, combined with currency impacts, exceeded cash
collections of both client and commercial financing assets in the third quarter
of 2010, which resulted in a net increase in financing assets from June 30,
2010. Cash collections of both client and commercial financing assets exceeded
new financing originations for the first nine months of 2010, which resulted in
a net decline in financing assets from December 31, 2009. The increase in
originations in both periods in the table above was primarily due to improving
volumes in commercial financing.
 
Cash
generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany
payables and dividends to IBM.

*   Represents reserved receivables, net
of recoveries, which were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents translation adjustments.
 
The
percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved decreased from 2.1 percent
at December 31, 2009 to 1.9 percent at September 30, 2010.  Specific reserves decreased 11.8 percent from
$416 million at December 31, 2009 to $367 million at September 30,
2010 driven by the disposition of receivables previously reserved.  Unallocated reserves decreased $50 million
from $120 million at December 31, 2009 to $70 million at September 30,
2010 primarily due to the decline in gross financing receivables.
 
Global
Financings bad debt expense was a decrease of $25 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2010, compared to an increase of $89 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The decrease in bad debt expense
was attributed to a decline in specific reserve requirements versus the prior
year.
 
Residual
Value
 
Residual
value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at
lease inception.  Global Financing has
insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global
Financing optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced
from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease
arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at the end of a lease, represented 45.5 percent
and 44.2 percent of Global Financings revenue in the third quarter and first
nine months, respectively, of 2010 and 41.9 percent and 41.1 percent in the
third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2009.  The increase in both periods was driven by
both the increase in sales revenue and the decrease in financing revenue.  The gross margins on these sales were 54.8
percent and 45.3 percent in the third quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively,
and 53.8 percent and 49.8 percent for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by both higher external
and internal sales margins.
 
The
following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2010 and September 30,
2010. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30, 2010 is
expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that
are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease
or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees
were $141 million and $116 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and September 30,
2009, respectively, and $356 million and $382 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively.
The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease
were $8 million and $7 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and September 30,
2009, respectively, and $20 million and $23 million for the financing
transactions originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2010
and September 30, 2009, respectively. The cost of guarantees was
$0.8 million for both the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and for
the quarter ended September 30, 2009, respectively, and $2.0 million
and $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and September 30,
2009, respectively.

The company funds Global Financing
through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans
and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company
to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing
receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 66.
 
The
Global Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys
external clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company. As
previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as if it were a
standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting
Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global
Financing Results of Operations on page 65 and in Segment Information on pages 24
and 26.
 
In
the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, however, the
external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal
financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest
expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on
total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arms-length pricing in support of Global Services
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Management
Discussion  (continued) 
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
Global
Financing is a segment of the company and therefore, is supported by the companys
overall liquidity position and access to capital markets. Cash generated by
Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay intercompany payables and
dividends to the company in order to maintain an appropriate debt-to-equity
ratio.

Looking
Forward
 
Global Financings financial
position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to
be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financings assets and
new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services financed to the
companys clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets
are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financings offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financings originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
IBM continues to access both
the short-term commercial paper market and the medium and long-term debt
markets.  A protracted period where IBM
could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in originations.
 
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact the
credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the
level of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 68,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both
through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its
remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage
each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with
product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the
business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the
global economy.
