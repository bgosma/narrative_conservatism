RocketFuel
Blockchain Company, a Nevada corporation (“RocketFuel” or the “Company”) was formed on January 12, 2018
for the purpose of bringing highly efficient check-out systems to eCommerce. These new check-out means based upon blockchain technology
are designed to increase speed, security, and ease of use. Using RocketFuel’s technology, merchants can enable new impulse
buying schemes that may be unavailable in present day eCommerce sites.
 
On
June 27, 2018, we consummated a transaction as contemplated by that certain Contribution Agreement made and entered into as of
June 27, 2018 by and among B4MC Gold Mines, Inc. (“B4MC”), a Nevada corporation, and us. Pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement, B4MC issued 17,001,312 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock to us in exchange for a 100% ownership interest
in us resulting in 22,668,416 post-merger shares of B4MC common stock issued and outstanding. On September 25, 2018, B4MC changed
its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc.

Interim Financial Statements and Basis of Presentation
 
The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information pursuant to Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these
unaudited condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which we consider necessary, for a fair presentation of those financial statements.
The results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 may not necessarily be indicative of results
that may be expected for any succeeding quarter or for the entire fiscal year. These condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with our audited financial statements as of March 31, 2019 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) on August 23, 2019.
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments, which are
evaluated on an ongoing basis, and that affect the amounts reported in our unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying
notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and judgments.
 
Our
significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to the audited financial statements as of March 31, 2019 which are included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on August 23, 2019.

 
Reclassification
 
Certain amounts from prior periods
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

 
3.
Going Concern
 
Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we
reported a net loss of $105,807
and negative cash flows of $113,679
from operating activities. As of December 31, 2019, we reported negative working capital of $64,495.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Prior
to June 27, 2018, management was engaged in efforts to identify and negotiate a transaction with a public company quoted on the
OTC Markets having shell status where a contemplated transaction would be treated as a reverse merger. On June 27, 2018, we consummated
a transaction as contemplated by that certain Contribution Agreement made and entered into as of June 27, 2018 by and among B4MC
and us. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, B4MC issued 17,001,312 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock to us in exchange
for a 100% ownership interest in us resulting in 22,668,416 post-merger shares of B4MC common stock issued and outstanding. We
financed our efforts to consummate this reverse merger transaction through the issuance of equity securities. We will require
additional financing in order to continue to develop our product and execute on our business plan. However, there can be no assurances
that we will be successful in raising the additional capital necessary to continue operations and execute on our business plan.

New Accounting Pronouncements
 
From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We believe that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other
authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on our accounting or reporting
or that such impact will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.
 

5.
Income Taxes
 
We
are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States. The preparation of these tax returns requires
us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which could affect the amount of tax
paid by us. In consultation with our tax advisors, we base our tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. The tax returns, however, are subject to routine reviews by the various federal and state taxing authorities
in the jurisdictions in which we file tax returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the
income tax positions taken by us (“uncertain tax positions”) and, therefore, may require us to pay additional taxes.
As required under applicable accounting rules, we accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability, including
interest and penalties, which we could incur as a result of the ultimate or effective resolution of the uncertain tax positions.
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.
 
In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
 
We
had no income tax credits for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The effective tax rates for the three
and nine months ended December 31, 2019 was 21.0%. We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Tax
Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing but have kept the full valuation allowance.
 
The
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law.
Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced
earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base
erosion tax, respectively. The Tax Act requires us to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously
subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8% on the
remaining earnings.

Stockholders’ Deficit
 
Prior
to August 8, 2018, we had 750,000,000 shares of our $0.001 par value common stock authorized. On August 8, 2018, our Board of
Directors voted to amend our articles of incorporation whereby the authorized shares of our common stock were reduced to 250,000,000.
Additionally, the Board authorized 50,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock. On September 25, 2018, we filed a certificate
of amendment to our articles of incorporation to effect such changes. On June 27, 2018, we consummated a transaction as contemplated
by that certain Contribution Agreement made and entered into as of June 27, 2018 by and among B4MC and us. Pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement, B4MC issued 17,001,312 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock to us in exchange for a 100% ownership interest
in us resulting in 22,668,416 post-merger shares of B4MC common stock issued and outstanding.
 
On
October 1, 2018, we entered into a corporate advisory agreement with a consultant (the “Consultant”), who is a non-related
party, to provide business advisory services, including research distribution services. As compensation for these services, the
Consultant received 12,500 shares of our common stock having a value of $50,000 based on a fair market value of $4.00 per share
as determined by recent private financings that occurred on October 3, 2018 and November 7, 2018 which are described below.
 
On
October 3, 2018 and November 7, 2018, we issued an aggregate of 7,500 shares of our common stock to one investor at $4.00 per
share in consideration of $30,000 in cash.
 
On
September 3, 2019, a private investor purchased 100,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. These securities
were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rules 506 and 903 thereunder and constitute
restricted securities under Rule 144 thereunder.
 
As
of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, we had 22,788,416 shares and 22,688,416 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding,
respectively.
 
7.
Stock-Based Compensation
 
On
August 8, 2018, the Board and stockholders holding a majority of our voting power approved the “RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc.,
2018 Stock Incentive Plan,” which plan enables us to make awards that qualify as performance-based compensation. We have
reserved 2,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with awards under the plan.
 
On
August 8, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the grant of options to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Bennett
J. Yankowitz, our chief financial officer and a director, pursuant to an exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Pursuant to the terms of the option agreement, these options are exercisable
immediately on the date of grant at an exercise price of $3.00 per share and are exercisable for a term of 10 years from the date
of grant. In determining the fair value of the stock option, we used the Black-Scholes pricing model having the following assumptions:
i) stock option exercise price of $3.00; ii) fair market value of our common stock of $4.00, which was based on available valuation
factors made available to us at that time of the date of grant; iii) expected term of option of 7 years; iv) expected volatility
of our common stock of approximately 40%; v) expected dividend rate of 0.0%; and vi) risk-free interest rate of approximately
2.80%. As a result, we recorded stock-based compensation of $1,100,350 on the date of grant.
 
8.
Legal Proceedings
 
We
are not the subject of any pending legal proceedings; and to the knowledge of management, no proceedings are presently contemplated
against us by any federal, state or local governmental agency. Further, to the knowledge of management, no director or executive
officer is party to any action in which any has an interest adverse to us.
 
9.
Subsequent Events

Forward-Looking
Statements
 
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the federal
securities laws. These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by
us using information currently available.
 
The
words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,”
“should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such
statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
and are not guaranties of future performance. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated,
expected, intended or using other similar expressions. We are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because
they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions include those discussed under “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis” and “Business.” Although we have sought to identify the most
significant risks to our business, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized, nor can there
be any assurance that we have identified all possible issues which we might face. For all of these reasons, the reader is cautioned
not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume
no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except
as required by law. We urge readers to review carefully the risk factors described in this Quarterly Report and in the other documents
that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can read these documents at www.sec.gov.
 
Overview
 
RocketFuel
was formed on January 12, 2018 for the purpose of bringing highly efficient check-out systems to eCommerce. We are currently developing
innovative check-out systems based upon blockchain technology and designed to increase speed, security, and ease of use. We believe
that users of RocketFuel’s systems will enjoy a seamless check-out experience compared to current online shopping solutions.
We believe that with RocketFuel’s technology, online merchants will be able to implement new impulse buying schemes that
are unavailable in present day eCommerce sites.
 
On
June 27, 2018, we consummated the Business Combination and related transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement. Pursuant
to the Contribution Agreement, B4MC issued 17,001,312 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock to the Sellers in exchange for
a 100% ownership interest in us, resulting in 22,668,416 post-merger shares of B4MC common stock issued and outstanding.
 
On
June 29, 2018, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which fully describes the transaction
set forth herein.
 
Critical
Accounting Policies
 
Our
significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 to the financial statements as of March 31, 2019 which are included in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
these financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates
on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. In the past, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates.
However, results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

the Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs December 31, 2018

had no revenue generating operations during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
General
and Administrative Expenses
 
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2019 were $36,719 as compared with $80,555 for the prior year
period, a decrease of $43,836 or 54.4%. The decrease is primarily a result of the recording of $50,000 in stock-based compensation
during the three months ended December 31, 2018 for services provided by a consultant which did not reoccur during the three months
ended December 31, 2019.
 
For
the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs December 31, 2018
 
Revenues
 
We
had no revenue generating operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
General
and Administrative Expenses
 
General and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 were $105,807 as compared with $3,329,632 for the prior year period, a decrease
of $3,223,825 or 96.9%. The decrease is primarily a result of the recording of $3,204,208 in stock-based compensation for stock
options to our chief financial officer and a consultant for services during the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
As
of December 31, 2019, we had cash of $5,807 as compared to $19,486 as of March 31, 2019.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we had net cash of $113,679 used in operating activities, which was composed of our net
loss of $105,807 and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7,872. During the nine months ended December 31,
2018, we had net cash of $2,220 used in operating activities, which was composed of our net loss of $3,329,632 and offset by
(i) the recording of $3,204,209 in stock-based compensation for stock options to our chief financial officer and a consultant
for services; and (ii) an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $127,643 primarily for legal and accounting fees
and the effect of the reverse merger transaction.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we had net cash of $100,000 provided by financing activities from the issuance of 100,000
shares of our common stock to an investor. During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we had net cash of $29,695 provided
by financing activities, which was composed of (i) the repayment of $305 of related party advances, and (ii) the issuance of 7,500
shares of our common stock to one investor in consideration of $30,000 in cash.
 
Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incorporated our business on January 12, 2018. During the
nine months ended December 31, 2019, we reported a net loss of $105,807 and negative cash flows of $113,679 from operating activities.
As of December 31, 2019, we reported negative working capital of $64,495. As a result, management believes that there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Prior
to June 27, 2018, management was engaged in efforts to identify and negotiate a transaction with a public company quoted on the
OTC Markets having shell status where a contemplated transaction would be treated as a reverse merger. On June 27, 2018, we consummated
a transaction as contemplated by that certain Contribution Agreement made and entered into as of June 27, 2018 by and among B4MC
Gold Mines, Inc. (“B4MC”), a Nevada corporation, and us. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, B4MC issued 17,001,312
shares of its $0.001 par value common stock to us in exchange for a 100% ownership interest in us resulting in 22,668,416 post-merger
shares of B4MC common stock issued and outstanding. We financed our efforts to consummate this reverse merger transaction through
the issuance of equity securities. In October 2018, we issued (i) 12,500 shares of our common stock, having a fair market value
of $4.00 per share, or $50,000, in consideration for business advisory services, including research distribution services; and
(ii) 1,250 shares of our common stock to an investor (the “Investor”) at $4.00 per share in consideration for $5,000
in cash. In November 2018, we issued an additional 6,250 shares of our common stock to the Investor at $4.00 per share in consideration
for $25,000 in cash. We will require additional financing in order to continue to develop our product and execute on our business
plan. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the additional capital necessary to continue operations
and execute on our business plan.

4. Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Based
on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act were not effective as of December 31, 2019 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation,
our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to
(i) insufficient segregation of duties in the finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel; and (ii) inadequate corporate
governance policies. In the future, subject to working capital limitations, we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps
to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies.
 
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
