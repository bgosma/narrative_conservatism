NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
 
NOTE
1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Portsmouth Square, Inc. (“Portsmouth”
or the “Company”), without audit, according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although the Company believes the disclosures that are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
Further, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which included
only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, cash flows and results of operations
as of and for the periods indicated. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements of Portsmouth and the notes therein included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June
30, 2019. The December 31, 2019 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from the consolidated balance sheet as included
in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019.
 
The
results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
 
Portsmouth’s
primary business is conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors Limited Partnership, a
California limited partnership (“Justice” or the “Partnership”). Portsmouth
has a 93.3% limited partnership interest in Justice and is the sole general partner. The financial statements of Justice are consolidated
with those of the Company.
 
As
of December 31, 2019, Santa Fe Financial Corporation (“Santa Fe”), a public company, owns approximately 68.8% of the
outstanding common shares of Portsmouth. Santa Fe is an 86.3%-owned subsidiary of The InterGroup Corporation (“InterGroup”),
a public company. This percentage includes the power to vote an approximately 4% interest in the common stock in Santa Fe owned
by InterGroup’s Chairman and President pursuant to a voting trust agreement entered into on June 30, 1998. InterGroup also
directly owns approximately 13.4% of the common stock of Portsmouth.
 
Justice,
through its subsidiaries Justice Operating Company, LLC (“Operating”) and Justice Mezzanine Company, LLC (“Mezzanine”)
owns and operates a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco
Financial District (the “Hotel”) and related facilities including a five-level underground parking garage. Mezzanine
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the borrower
under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating.
The Hotel is operated by the partnership as a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT
Franchise Holding LLC (“Hilton”) through January 31, 2030.
 
Justice
entered into a Hotel management agreement (“HMA”) with Interstate Management Company, LLC (“Interstate”)
to manage the Hotel, along with its five-level parking garage, with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017. The term of
the management agreement is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for successive
one (1) year periods, to not exceed five years in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions. Under the terms on the HMA, base
management fee payable to Interstate shall be one and seven-tenths percent (1.70%) of total Hotel revenue. On October 25, 2019,
Interstate merged with Aimbridge Hospitality, North America’s largest independent hotel management firm. With the completion
of the merger, the newly combined company will be positioned under the Aimbridge Hospitality name in the Americas.

Due
to Securities Broker
 
Various
securities brokers have advanced funds to the Company for the purchase of marketable securities under standard margin agreements.
These advanced funds are recorded as a liability.
 
Obligations
for Securities Sold
 
Obligation
for securities sold represents the fair market value of shares sold with the promise to deliver that security at some future date
and the fair market value of shares underlying the written call options with the obligation to deliver that security when and
if the option is exercised. The obligation may be satisfied with current holdings of the same security or by subsequent purchases
of that security. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in the obligation are included in the condensed consolidated statements
of operations.
 
Income
Tax
 
The
Company consolidates Justice (“Hotel”) for financial reporting purposes and is not taxed on its non-controlling interest
in the Hotel. The income tax expense during the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 represent the income tax effect on
the Company’s pretax income which includes its share in the net income of the Hotel.
 
Financial
Condition and Liquidity
 
The
Company’s cash flows are primarily generated from its Hotel operations. The Company may also receive cash generated from
the investment of its cash and marketable securities and other investments.
 
To
fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and to repay the prior mortgage of $42,940,000, Justice obtained a $97,000,000
mortgage loan and a $20,000,000 mezzanine loan in December 2013. The mortgage loan is secured by the Partnership’s principal
asset, the Hotel. The mortgage loan bears an interest rate of 5.275% per annum with interest only payments due through January
2017. Beginning in February 2017, the loan began to amortize over a thirty-year period through its maturity date of January 2024.
Outstanding principal balance on the loan was $92,914,000 and $93,746,000 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively.
As additional security for the mortgage loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mortgage lender.
The mezzanine loan is secured by the Operating membership interest held by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan.
The mezzanine interest only loan had an interest rate of 9.75% per annum and a maturity date of January 1, 2024. As additional
security for the mezzanine loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mezzanine lender. On July
31, 2019, Mezzanine refinanced the mezzanine loan by entering into a new mezzanine loan agreement (“New Mezzanine Loan Agreement”)
with Cred Reit Holdco LLC in the amount of $20,000,000. The prior Mezzanine Loan which had a 9.75% per annum interest rate was
paid off. Interest rate on the new mezzanine loan is 7.25% and the loan matures on January 1, 2024. Interest only payments are
due monthly.
 
Effective
as of May 11, 2017, InterGroup agreed to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor
under the environmental indemnity for Justice Investors limited partnership’s $97,000,000 mortgage loan and the $20,000,000
mezzanine loan. Pursuant to the agreement, InterGroup is required to maintain a certain net worth and liquidity. As of December
31, 2019, InterGroup is in compliance with both requirements.
 
The
Hotel has continued to generate positive operating income. While the debt service requirements related to the loans may create
some additional risk for the Company and its ability to generate cash flows in the future, management believes that cash flows
from the operations of the Hotel and the garage will continue to be sufficient to meet all of the Partnership’s current
and future obligations and financial requirements.
 
The
Company has invested in short-term, income-producing instruments and in equity and debt securities when deemed appropriate. The
Company’s marketable securities are classified as trading with unrealized gains and losses recorded through the consolidated
statements of operations.
 


Management
believes that its cash, marketable securities, and the cash flows generated from the partnership management fees, will be adequate
to meet the Company’s current and future obligations. Additionally, management believes there is significant appreciated
value in the Hotel property to support additional borrowings, if necessary.

interest payments:
 

 
Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires
lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements.
ASU 2018-11 provides entities another option for transition, allowing entities to not apply the new standard in the comparative
periods they present in their financial statements in the year of adoption. Effective July 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02 using
the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 2018-11. We elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition
guidance, including the election to carryforward historical lease classification. We also elected the short-term lease practical
expedient, which allowed us to not recognize leases with a term of less than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets.
In addition, we elected the lease and non-lease components practical expedient, which allowed us to calculate the present value
of the fixed payments without performing an allocation of lease and non-lease components. We did not record any operating lease
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities upon adoption of the new standard as the aggregate value
of the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are immaterial relative to our total assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2019.
The standard did not have an impact on our other finance leases, statements of operations or cash flows. See Note 3 and Note 10
for balances of finance lease ROU assets and liabilities, respectively.
 
On
June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU modifies the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in
place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the timelier recognition of losses. ASU No. 2016-13
will be effective for us as of January 1, 2023. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of ASU No. 2016-13.
 
NOTE
2 – REVENUE
 
The
following table present our revenues disaggregated by revenue streams.
 

 

-10-
 

 

 
Performance
obligations
 
We
identified the following performance obligations for which revenue is recognized as the respective performance obligations are
satisfied, which results in recognizing the amount we expect to be entitled to for providing the goods or services:
 


 
●
Cancelable
    room reservations or ancillary services are typically satisfied as the good or service is transferred to the hotel guest,
    which is generally when the room stay occurs.

 
 
 

 
●
Noncancelable
    room reservations and banquet or conference reservations represent a series of distinct goods or services provided over
    time and satisfied as each distinct good or service is provided, which is reflected by the duration of the room reservation.

 
 
 

 
●
Other
    ancillary goods and services are purchased independently of the room reservation at standalone selling prices and are
    considered separate performance obligations, which are satisfied when the related good or service is provided to the hotel
    guest.

 
 
 

 
●
Components
    of package reservations for which each component could be sold separately to other hotel guests are considered separate
    performance obligations and are satisfied as set forth above.

 
Hotel
revenue primarily consists of hotel room rentals, revenue from accommodations sold in conjunction with other services (e.g., package
reservations), food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services (e.g., parking). Revenue is recognized when rooms
are occupied or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively. Payment terms typically align with when the
goods and services are provided. For package reservations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations within
the package based on the estimated standalone selling prices of each component.
 
We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of one year or less. Due
to the nature of our business, our revenue is not significantly impacted by refunds. Cash payments received in advance of guests
staying at our hotel are refunded to hotel guests if the guest cancels within the specified time period, before any services are
rendered. Refunds related to service are generally recognized as an adjustment to the transaction price at the time the hotel
stay occurs or services are rendered.
 
Contract
assets and liabilities
 
We
do not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, other than trade and other receivables, net
on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our receivables are primarily the result of contracts with customers, which are
reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of amounts that will not be collected.
 
We
record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of guests staying at our hotel, which are presented
within accounts payable and other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities decreased to
$1,027,000 as of December 31, 2019, from $1,215,000 as of June 30, 2019. The decrease for the six months ended December 31, 2019
was primarily driven by $188,000 revenue recognized that was included in the advanced deposits balance as of June 30, 2019.
 

-11-
 

 

Contract
costs
 
We
consider sales commissions earned to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract with our customers. As a practical expedient,
we expense these costs as incurred as our contracts with customers are less than one year.
 
NOTE
3 – INVESTMENT IN HOTEL, NET
 
Investment
in hotel consisted of the following as of:
 

 

 

NOTE
4 – INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE
 
In
August 2007, the Company agreed to acquire 50% interest in InterGroup Uluniu, Inc., a Hawaiian corporation and a 100% owned subsidiary
of InterGroup, for $973,000, which represents an amount equal to the costs paid by InterGroup for the acquisition and carrying
costs of approximately two acres of unimproved land held for development located in Maui, Hawaii. As a related-party transaction,
the fairness of the financial terms of the transaction were reviewed and approved by the independent director of the Company.
 
NOTE
5 - INVESTMENT IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES
 
The
Company’s investment in marketable securities consists primarily of corporate equities. The Company has also periodically
invested in corporate bonds and income producing securities, which may include interests in real estate-based companies and REITs,
where financial benefit could transfer to its shareholders through income and/or capital gain.
 


-12-
 

 
At
December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, all of the Company’s marketable securities are classified as trading securities. The
change in the unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in earnings. Trading securities are summarized as
follows:
 

 
As
of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, approximately 14% and 24%, respectively,
of the investment marketable securities balance above is comprised of the common stock of Comstock Mining, Inc. (“Comstock”
- NYSE AMERICAN: LODE).
 
As
of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, the Company had $2,179,000 and $5,697,000,
respectively, of unrealized losses related to securities held for over one year. As of December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, unrealized
losses related to the Company’s investment in Comstock were $2,171,000 and $5,666,000, respectively. For the six months
ended December 31, 2019, the decrease in unrealized losses is a result of reclassing $3,676,000 of unrealized gain related to
Comstock that was included in the cost basis as of June 30, 2019.
 
Net
gains (losses) on marketable securities on the statement of operations is comprised of realized and unrealized gains (losses).
Below is the composition of net loss on marketable securities for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively:
 


 

 
NOTE
6 – OTHER INVESTMENTS, NET
 
The
Company may also invest, with the approval of the securities investment committee and other Company guidelines, in private investment
equity funds and other unlisted securities, such as convertible notes through private placements. Those investments in non-marketable
securities are carried at cost on the Company’s balance sheet as part of other investments, net of other than temporary
impairment losses.
 

-13-
 

 
Other
investments, net consist of the following:
 

 
NOTE
7 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
 
The
carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis approximate
fair value due to their short maturities (i.e., accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable and other liabilities) or
the nature and terms of the obligation (i.e., other notes payable and mortgage notes payable).
 
The
assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:
 

 
The
fair values of investments in marketable securities are determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance
sheet date.
 
Financial
assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are not included in the tables above include “Other
investments, net (non-marketable securities),” that were initially measured at cost and have been written down to fair value
as a result of impairment. The following table shows the fair value hierarchy for these assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis as follows:

 

 

 
For
the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we received distribution from other non-marketable investments of $12,000 and
$29,000, respectively.
 


-14-
 

 
Other
investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost net of any impairment loss. The Company has no significant influence
or control over the entities that issue these investments and holds less than 20% ownership in each of the investments. These
investments are reviewed on a periodic basis for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company reviews several factors to determine
whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include but are not limited to: (i) the length of time an investment is
in an unrealized loss position, (ii) the extent to which fair value is less than cost, (iii) the financial condition and near
term prospects of the issuer and (iv) our ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in fair value.
 
NOTE
8 – CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH
 
The
following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the condensed consolidated
balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows:
 

 
Restricted
cash is comprised of amounts held by lenders for payment of real estate taxes, insurance, replacement and capital addition reserves
for the Hotel. It also includes key money received from Interstate that is restricted for capital improvements for the Hotel.
 
NOTE
9 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
The
Company operates in two reportable segments, the operation of the hotel (“Hotel Operations”) and the investment of
its cash in marketable securities and other investments (“Investment Transactions”). These two operating segments,
as presented in the consolidated financial statements, reflect how management internally reviews each segment’s performance.
Management also makes operational and strategic decisions based on this same information.
 
Information
below represents reporting segments for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating income
from Hotel operations consists of the operation of the hotel and operation of the garage. Income (loss) from investment transactions
consist of net investment gain (loss), impairment loss on other investments, net unrealized gain (loss) on other investments,
dividend and interest income and trading and margin interest expense. The other segment consists of corporate general and administrative
expenses and the income tax (expense) benefit for the entire Company.

July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of $4,250,000 at 12% per year
fixed interest, with a term of 2 years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a 3% loan fee. The loan may be prepaid

Note
payable to Hilton (Franchisor) is a self-exhausting, interest free development incentive note which is reduced by approximately
$316,000 annually through 2030 by Hilton if the Partnership is still a Franchisee with Hilton.
 
On
February 1, 2017, Justice entered into an HMA with Interstate to manage the Hotel with an effective takeover date of February
3, 2017. The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of 10 years commencing on the takeover date and automatically
renews for an additional year not to exceed five years in aggregate subject to certain conditions. The HMA also provides for Interstate
to advance a key money incentive fee to the Hotel for capital improvements in the amount of $2,000,000 under certain terms and
conditions described in a separate key money agreement. The key money contribution shall be amortized in equal monthly amounts
over an eight (8) year period commencing on the second (2nd) anniversary of the takeover date. As of December 31, 2019,
and June 30, 2019, balance of the key money plus accrued interest is $1,004,000 and $2,049,000, respectively, and is included
in restricted cash in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized portion of the key money is included in the related
party notes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 
As
of December 31, 2019, the Company had finance lease obligations outstanding of $1,282,000. These finance leases expire in various
years through 2023 at rates ranging from 5.77% to 6.25% per annum. Minimum future lease payments for assets under finance leases

As
of December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, the Company had accounts payable to related party of $2,245,000 and $2,122,000, respectively.
These are amounts due to InterGroup and represent certain shared costs and expenses, primarily general and administrative expenses,
rent, insurance and other expenses that are allocated among the Company, Santa Fe and InterGroup.
 
Effective
May 12, 2017, InterGroup agreed to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor under
environmental indemnity for Justice Investors limited partnership’s $97,000,000 mortgage loan and the $20,000,000 mezzanine
loan, in order to maintain certain minimum net worth and liquidity guarantor covenant requirements that Portsmouth was unable
to satisfy independently as of March 31, 2017. The Company’s Board of Directors is currently comprised of directors John
V. Winfield, William J. Nance, John C. Love, Jerold R. Babin, and Steve Grunwald. All of the Company’s directors also serve
as directors of InterGroup except for Mr. Grunwald. Messrs. Winfield and Nance also serve on the Board of Santa Fe.

John
V. Winfield serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company, Santa Fe, and InterGroup. Depending on certain market
conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive Officer, Santa Fe and InterGroup may, at times, invest in the same companies
in which the Company invests. The Company encourages such investments because it places personal resources of the Chief Executive
Officer and the resources of Santa Fe and InterGroup, at risk in connection with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.

Company's principal source of revenue continues to be derived from its general and limited partnership interest in the Justice
Investors Limited Partnership (“Justice” or the “Partnership”) inclusive of hotel room revenue, food and
beverage revenue, garage revenue, and revenue from other operating departments. Justice owns the Hotel and related facilities,
including a five-level underground parking garage. The financial statements of Justice have been consolidated with those of the
Company.

The
Hotel is operated by the Partnership as a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement (the “License
Agreement”) with Hilton. The Partnership entered into the License Agreement on December 10, 2004. The term of the License
Agreement was for an initial period of 15 years commencing on the opening date, with an option to extend the License Agreement
for another five years, subject to certain conditions. On June 26, 2015, the Partnership and Hilton entered into an amended franchise
agreement which extended the License Agreement through 2030, modified the monthly royalty rate, extended geographic protection
to the Partnership and also provided the Partnership certain key money cash incentives to be earned through 2030. The key money
cash incentives were received on July 1, 2015.
 
On
February 1, 2017, Justice entered into a Hotel management agreement (“HMA”) with Interstate Management Company, LLC
(“Interstate”) to manage the Hotel and related facilities with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017. The
term of HMA is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for an additional year
not to exceed five years in aggregate subject to certain conditions. The HMA also provides for Interstate to advance a key money
incentive fee to the Hotel for capital improvements in the amount of $2,000,000 under certain terms and conditions described in
a separate key money agreement.
 
Three
Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2018
 
The
Company had net income of $426,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to net loss of $39,000 for the three
months ended December 31, 2018. The change is primarily attributable to the increase in Hotel revenue and reduced loss in marketable
securities, offset by the rise of Hotel operating expenses.
 
Hotel
Operations
 
The
Company had net income from Hotel operations of $784,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of
$280,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2018. The change is primarily attributable to the increase in Hotel revenue,
offset by the rise of Hotel operating expenses.
 
The
following table sets forth a more detailed presentation of Hotel operations for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 

 
For
the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Hotel had operating income of $3,171,000 before interest expense, depreciation and
amortization on total operating revenues of $14,901,000 compared to operating income of $2,761,000 before interest expense, depreciation
and amortization on total operating revenues of $13,997,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Hotel room revenue rose
by $932,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. The increase is
primarily due to the timing of Dreamforce, one of the largest annual citywide conventions in San Francisco, from September in
2018 to November in 2019. Food and beverage revenue decreased by $140,000 primarily due to decrease in banquet and catering revenue
as room revenue shifted towards the transient segment from groups with banquet and catering spending. Revenue from garage increased
by $42,000 as a result of the increase in occupancy and monthly parkers. Other operating departments revenue increased by $70,000
primarily due to increase in group cancellation revenue.
 


-20-
 

 
Total
operating expenses increased by $494,000 primarily due to annual wage increase per union bargaining agreements.
 
The
following table sets forth the average daily room rate, average occupancy percentage and RevPAR of the Hotel for the three months
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 

 
The

period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical value. For a more detailed
description of the composition of the Company’s marketable securities see the Marketable Securities section below.
 
The
Company consolidates Justice (Hotel) for financial reporting purposes and is not taxed on its non-controlling interest in the
Hotel. The income tax expense (benefit) during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 represents the income tax effect
on the Company’s pretax income (loss) which includes its share in the net income of the Hotel.
 
Six
Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2018
 
The
Company had net income of $1,351,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $1,443,000 for the six

and amortization on total operating revenues of $29,807,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2018. Hotel room revenue rose
by $724,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily
due to replacing guaranteed room revenue at low rates with room revenue at higher market rates driven by citywide conventions.
Food and beverage revenue decreased by $367,000 primarily due to decrease in banquet and catering revenue as room revenue shifted
towards the transient segment from groups with banquet and catering spending. Garage revenue remained consistent year over year.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
 
The
Company’s cash flows are primarily generated from its Hotel operations and general partner management fees. The Company
may also receive cash generated from the investment of its cash and marketable securities and other investments.
 
To
fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and to repay the prior mortgage, Justice obtained a $97,000,000 mortgage
loan and a $20,000,000 mezzanine loan in December of 2013. The mortgage loan is secured by the Partnership’s principal asset,
the Hotel. The mortgage loan bears an interest rate of 5.275% per annum and matures in January 2024. Outstanding principal balance
on the loan was $92,914,000 and $93,746,000 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. As additional security for
the mortgage loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by the Portsmouth in favor of the mortgage lender. The mezzanine loan
is a secured by the Operating membership interest held by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan. The mezzanine interest
only loan had an interest rate of 9.75% per annum and a maturity date of January 1, 2024. As additional security for the mezzanine
loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mezzanine lender. On July 31, 2019, Mezzanine refinanced
the Mezzanine Loan by entering into a new mezzanine loan agreement (“New Mezzanine Loan Agreement”) with Cred Reit
Holdco LLC in the amount of $20,000,000. The prior Mezzanine Loan was paid off. Interest rate on the new mezzanine loan is 7.25%
and the loan matures on January 1, 2024. Interest only payments are due monthly. Effective as of May 12, 2017, InterGroup agreed
to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor under the environmental indemnity for
Justice Investors limited partnership’s $97,000,000 mortgage loan and the $20,000,000 mezzanine loan.
 
On
July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of $4,250,000 at 12% per year
fixed interest, with a term of 2 years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a 3% loan fee. The loan may be prepaid
at any time without penalty. The loan was extended to June 30, 2020. The balance of this loan was $3,000,000 as of December 31,
2019 and June 30, 2019, and are included in the related party and other note payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 
The
Hotel has continued to generate strong revenue growth. While the debt service requirements related to the loans may create some
additional risks for the Company and its ability to generate cash flows in the future, management believes that cash flows from
the operations of the Hotel and the garage will continue to be sufficient to meet all of the Partnership’s current and future
obligations and financial requirements.
 
The
Company has invested in short-term, income-producing instruments and in equity and debt securities when deemed appropriate. The
Company's marketable securities are classified as trading with unrealized gains and losses recorded through the consolidated statements
of operations.
 
Management
believes that its cash, marketable securities, and the cash flows generated from the partnership management fees, will be adequate
to meet the Company’s current and future obligations. Additionally, management believes there is significant appreciated
value in the Hotel property to support additional borrowings, if necessary.

MATERIAL
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
 
The
following table provides a summary as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s material financial obligations which also includes
interest payments:
 

 
OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
 
The
Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements.
 
IMPACT
OF INFLATION
 
Hotel
room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited
number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Interstate has
the power and ability to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis, there should be minimal
impact on partnership revenues due to inflation. Partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks, which may be influenced
by inflation. For the two most recent fiscal years, the impact of inflation on the Company's income is not viewed by management
as material.
 
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES
 
Critical
accounting policies are those that are most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations
and require judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The
preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the consolidation
of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances for bad debts, accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and
commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions
or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies during the six months ended
December 31, 2019 except for the adoption of ASU 2016-02. Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended June 30, 2019 for a summary of the critical accounting policies.
