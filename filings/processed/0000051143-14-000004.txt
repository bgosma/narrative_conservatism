Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The
financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the
company's management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
     
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake
in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be
different from these estimates. See the company's 2013 Annual Report on pages 67
to 70 for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
     
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full
year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the company's 2013 Annual Report.
 
     
Noncontrolling interest amounts in income of $(0.5) million and $1.4 million, net of tax, for
the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are included in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense
line item.
 
     
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows
may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.
Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. This is annotated where applicable.

 
 
2. Accounting Changes:  In April 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the criteria for reporting
a discontinued operation. According to the new guidance, only disposals of a
component that represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major
effect on an entity's operations and financial results is a discontinued
operation. The new guidance also requires expanded disclosures about
discontinued operations and disposals of a significant part of an entity that
does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The guidance is
effective beginning January 1, 2015 with early adoption permitted, but only for
disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in
previously-issued financial statements. The impact to the company will be
dependent on any transaction that is within the scope of the new guidance.
       In July 2013, the FASB
issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when
a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward exists. Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits
should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred
tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax
credit carryforward. The guidance was effective January 1, 2014, and was
adopted by the company in the first quarter. The guidance is a change in
financial statement presentation only and had no material impact in the
consolidated financial results. 
  In March 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on when foreign currency translation adjustments should be
released to net income. When a parent entity ceases to have a controlling
financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within
a foreign entity, the parent is required to release any related cumulative
translation adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation
adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer
results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign
entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2014 and did not have a material impact in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.  
     In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of
the guidance is fixed at the reporting date. Examples include debt
arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation matters. The
guidance requires an entity to measure such obligations as the sum of the
amount that the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement
among its co-obligors plus additional amounts the reporting entity expects to
pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance was effective January 1,
2014 and did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.

3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that
use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
       The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 
       Certain financial assets
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity
method investments that are recognized at fair value at the measurement date to
the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale
equity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In
the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a financial investment, fair
value is measured using a model described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. See Note A, “Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment,” on
page 88 in the company’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information.
There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the three months
ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
 
       Accounting guidance
permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and
firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other
accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied
the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2014 and December 31,
2013.

       Fair values are based
on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for
similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining
maturities. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the difference between the
carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables
was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these
financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.

Long-term
Debt
 
       Fair value of
publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the
identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other
long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected
present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair
value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $34,668 million and $32,856 million, and the estimated
fair value was $36,808 million and $34,555 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial
statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified
as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity
Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities
are considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position. 
 
       During the quarter, the
company acquired equity investments in conjunction with the sale of the
customer care business which are classified as trading securities. At March 31,
2014, unrealized gains related to trading securities of $6 million were recorded in
other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
       The following tables
summarize the company’s noncurrent debt and marketable equity securities which
are also considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
       The
company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender
and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the
company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and
client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and,
where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are
denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align
rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease
and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing
debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a
liability position at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $201 million and
$216 million, respectively, for which no collateral was posted at March 31,
2014 and December 31, 2013.  Full collateralization of these agreements would
be required in the event that the company’s credit rating falls below
investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points,
as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements.
The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in net asset positions as of
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $678 million and $719 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date as a result of the counterparties failing to perform as
contracted. This exposure was reduced by $221 million and $251 million at March
31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, of liabilities included in master
netting arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, this exposure was reduced by $23 million and $29 million
of cash collateral, respectively, received by the company. At March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $434 million and $439
million, respectively.  At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the net amount
related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position was $220 million and $250 million, respectively.  
 
       In the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset
derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does
it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash
collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. No
amount was recognized in other receivables at March 31, 2014 or December 31,
2013 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in
accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral totaled $23
million and $29 million at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation,
and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was rehypothecated at
March 31, 2014 or at December 31, 2013.  At March 31, 2014 and December 31,
2013, no amounts of non-cash collateral were held.   
 
       The
company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in
stockholders’ equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of significant
foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These
instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to
liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon
maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the
underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an
ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by
de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the
liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may
utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the
de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts,
interest-rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, depending upon the underlying
exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk,
follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The
company issues debt in the global capital markets, principally to fund its
financing lease and loan portfolios. Access to cost-effective financing can
result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these
mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate
swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt
(i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances
into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At March 31, 2014 and December
31, 2013, the total notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps was
$5.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining
maturity of these instruments at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was
approximately 9.5 years and 10.6 years, respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The
company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To
manage this risk, the company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to
lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt
issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did
not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
       At
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, net gains of approximately $1 million
(before taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings.
Within these amounts, gains of less than $1 million, respectively, are
expected to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing
an offsetting economic impact against the underlying transactions.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large
portion of the company’s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is
designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the
volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with
respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and
foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At March
31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments designated as net investment hedges was $3.4 billion and $3.0
billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these
instruments at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was approximately 0.4 years
for both periods.
 
Anticipated
Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The
company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party
vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services
among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In
anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility
of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange
forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the
company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four
years. At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of forward
contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost
transactions was $10.2 billion with a weighted-average remaining maturity of
0.7 years for both periods.
 
       At
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, in connection with cash flow hedges of
anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net losses of
$169 million and $252 million (before taxes), respectively, in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $155 million and $166
million of losses, respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net income
within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the
underlying anticipated transactions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
       The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert
fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in
the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. Currently, the maximum length of time over which the
company has hedged its exposure to variability in future cash flows is
approximately seven years.  At March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total
notional amount of cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of
foreign currency denominated debt was $1.2 billion for both periods.
 
       At
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, in connection with cash flow hedges of
foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $6
million (before taxes) and $9 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $3 million
of losses in both periods is expected to be reclassified to net income within
the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the
underlying exposure.            
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The
company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its
subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash
flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign
exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign
currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets
and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally
less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of
the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in
other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March
31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative instruments
in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $16.3 billion and $14.7
billion, respectively. 
 
Equity Risk
Management
 
       The
company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and
in the company’s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to
employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation
obligations are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and
futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee
compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on
certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock,
and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.2 billion and $1.3
billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
       The
company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with
various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share
or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair
value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as
derivatives outstanding at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
       The
company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due
under contractual terms. The company may utilize credit default swaps to economically
hedge its credit exposures. The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and
losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this
program outstanding at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
       The
following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and
non-derivative instrument- related risk management activity as of March 31,
2014 and December 31, 2013 as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2014
and 2013, respectively:

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relates principally to
the company’s systems products and are for terms ranging generally from two to
six years. Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases includes
unguaranteed residual values of $698 million and $737 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of
$634 million and $672 million, and net of the
allowance for credit losses of $131 million and $123 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $16 million and $23 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $222 million and $201 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to
clients to finance the purchase of software and services. Separate contractual
relationships on these financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally
from one to seven years.
 
      
Installment payment receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $41 million and $41 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to
clients to finance hardware, software and services ranging generally from one
to three years.
 
      
Client loan receivables and installment payment receivables financing contracts
are priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history
of enforcing the terms of these separate financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $756 million and $769 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of March
31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing
receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at March 31,
2014 and December 31, 2013. The company determines its allowance for credit
losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan receivables,
and further segments the

       When
determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an
individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the
company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an
estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts
in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. In
addition, the company records an unallocated reserve that is determined by
applying a reserve rate to its different portfolios, excluding accounts that
have been specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
       Certain receivables for which the company has recorded a
specific reserve may also be placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual assets
are those receivables with specific reserves and other accounts for  which it is likely
that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
original terms of the lease or loan agreement. Income recognition is
discontinued on these receivables. 
 
       The following table presents the recorded investment in
financing receivables which were on non-accrual status at March 31, 2014 and
December 31, 2013.

reserve as an impaired loan. Depending on the level of impairment, loans will
also be placed on non-accrual status.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating
agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers,
are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting
indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services credit ratings as shown below. Standard & Poor’s does not
provide credit ratings to the company on its customers.

21

 

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at March 31, 2014 and
December 31, 2013. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from AAA
to BBB- are considered investment grade. All others are considered
non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation
actions that the company may take to transfer credit risk to third parties.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

       The decrease
in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended March 31,
2014, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was due to
decreases related to restricted stock units ($9 million), performance
share units ($7 million) and the company’s
assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($4 million). 
 
       As of March
31, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $853 million related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.4 years.
 
    
 There
was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31, 2014
and 2013.
 
6. Segments:  
The table on page 25 reflects the results of operations of the company’s
segments consistent with the management and measurement system utilized within
the company. Performance measurement is based on pre-tax income. These results
are used, in part, by senior management, both in evaluating the performance of,
and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

   On March 24, 2014, the Supreme Court of Spain issued a ruling against IBM
Spain in litigation involving its defined benefit and defined contributions
plans. See page 35 for additional information. As a result of the ruling, the
company recorded an additional pre-tax retirement-related obligation of $55 million in the first quarter of 2014 in selling, general and
administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This charge
is not reflected in operating (non-GAAP) expense. This obligation is reflected
in "Non-U.S. Plans - Multi-employer plans/other costs" in the table
above. To date, the rulings in this case are declaratory only and there have
been no quantifications of any individual remedies.
 
       In March 2014, the company initiated a
change to the investment strategy of its U.S. defined benefit plan. The 2014
target asset allocation was modified, primarily by reducing equity securities
from 42 percent to 32 percent, and increasing
debt securities from 47 percent to 57 percent of total plan
assets, respectively. The asset allocation change was substantially completed
by March 31, 2014. This change is designed to reduce the potential negative
impact that equity markets might have on the funded status of the U.S. defined
benefit plan. The change is expected to reduce the 2015 expected long-term rate
of return on assets to approximately 7.75
percent. See note S,
"Retirement-Related Benefits," on page 135 in the company's 2013
Annual Report for additional information regarding the company's investment
strategy.         
 
       In 2014, the company expects to contribute to its
non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans approximately $600 million, which will be
mainly contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in Japan, the UK,
Switzerland and the Netherlands. This amount represents the legally mandated
minimum contributions. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the
first three months of 2014 were $126 million.

        In connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the ‘Act’), the company qualified to receive a
subsidy through 2013. Due to benefit plan changes effective January 1, 2014,
the company no longer qualifies for the subsidy as of that date. The company is
expected to receive additional subsidies after 2013 to true up the final
subsidy amount due to IBM under the Act. The
company received a $5.4 million subsidy in the
first quarter of 2014 and a $6.1 million subsidy in the
first quarter of 2013.  For further information related to the Act, see
page 141 in the company’s 2013 Annual Report.             
 
9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
 
Acquisitions: During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the company
completed two acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $286 million.
   
        The Software
segment completed acquisitions of two privately held companies in the first
quarter: Aspera, Inc. (Aspera) and Cloudant, Inc. (Cloudant).  Both  acquisitions were for 100
percent of the acquired companies.
 
       The

resulting purchase price allocations as of March 31, 2014:

Each acquisition
further complemented and enhanced the company’s portfolio of product and
services offerings.  Aspera’s technology makes cloud computing faster, more
predictable and more cost effective for big data transfers such as enterprise
storage, sharing virtual images or accessing the cloud for increased computing
capacity.  The acquisition of Cloudant will extend the company’s mobile and
cloud platforms by enabling developers to easily and quickly create next
generation mobile and web-based applications.  Purchase price consideration for these acquisitions as
reflected in the table above, was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions are
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and
cash equivalents.
       The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity was recorded at
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled work-force, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life
of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 6.8 years. These
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Goodwill of $239 million has been assigned to the Software
segment. It is expected that none of the goodwill will be deductible for tax
purposes. 
 
On April 10, 2014, the company announced that it had
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Silverpop, a privately held
company based in Atlanta, GA. Silverpop is a provider of cloud-based
capabilities that deliver personalized customer engagements in highly scalable
environments.  The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of
2014.

Divestitures: 
 
        On January 23,
2014, IBM and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) announced a definitive
agreement in which Lenovo will acquire the company’s x86 server portfolio for
$2.3 billion, consisting of approximately $2 billion in cash, with the balance
in Lenovo stock. The stock will represent less than 5 percent equity ownership
in Lenovo. The company will sell to Lenovo its System x, BladeCenter and Flex
System blade servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale
and iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and maintenance
operations.
 
  IBM and Lenovo plan to enter into a strategic
relationship which will include a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales
of IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems,
tape storage systems, General Parallel File System software, SmartCloud Entry
offering, and elements of IBM’s system software, including Systems Director and
Platform Computing solutions. Following the closing of the transaction, Lenovo
will assume related customer service and maintenance operations. IBM will
continue to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s behalf for an extended
period of time.
 
  The transaction will be completed as soon as
is practical, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements, customary
closing conditions and any other required approvals. At March 31, 2014, the
company is engaged in the regulatory review process and in the activities
necessary to separate the tangible assets in order to close the transaction. The
transaction is expected to be completed in phases, with the initial closing
expected in the second half of 2014. Subsequent local closings will occur
subject to similar conditions, agreements and the information and consultation
process in applicable countries.
 
  The company expects to recognize a total
pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1 billion. This gain will be
recognized consistent with the closing schedule for the transaction. The exact
amount of the gain and the breakdown by closing date is not yet determinable.
The variables that can impact the final gain include the valuation of the final
balance sheet transferred, the valuation of other related agreements and
transaction-related expenses. 
 
  The company’s worldwide x86 business is reported
in the Systems and Technology segment, and the associated maintenance
operations are part of the Global Technology Services segment. In 2013, this
combined business delivered approximately $4.6 billion of revenue, was
essentially breakeven on a pre-tax income basis and had approximately $100
million in tangible assets.
 
       On September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a
definitive agreement in which SYNNEX will acquire the company’s worldwide
customer care business process outsourcing services business for $501 million,
consisting of approximately $430 million in cash, net of balance sheet
adjustments, and $71 million in SYNNEX stock, which represents less than 5
percent equity ownership in SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered
into a multi-year agreement with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s
outsourcing business, has become an IBM strategic business partner for global
customer care business process outsourcing services. 
 
        The transaction is being completed in phases – the initial closing
was completed on January 31, 2014, with subsequent closings expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2014, subject to customary closing conditions,
local agreements and the information and consultation process in applicable
countries. The company expects to recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale of
between $200 million and $225 million. The gain recognized in the first quarter
of 2014 was $98 million. The company’s worldwide customer care business process
outsourcing services and industry process services was reported in the Global
Technology Services segment. In 2013, the divested business delivered
approximately $1.3 billion of revenue, approximately $0.1 billion of pre-tax
income and had approximately $50 million in tangible assets.
 
       On April 17, 2012, the company
announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba TEC for the
sale of its Retail Store Solutions business. As part of the transaction, the
company agreed to transfer the maintenance business to Toshiba TEC within three
years of the original closing of the transaction.
 
       In first quarter 2014, the company
completed the first phase of the transfer of the maintenance workforce to
Toshiba. Subsequent wave closings are scheduled to be completed through the
first quarter of 2015 along with associated parts and inventory transfer. The
first phase transfer and an assessment of the ongoing contractual terms of the
overall transaction resulted in the recognition of an additional pre-tax gain
of $34 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
 
       The company expects to close the final
phase of the divestiture in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, the company
expects to recognize a cumulative total pre-tax gain on the sale of
approximately $508 million.

* Other intangibles are primarily acquired
proprietary and nonproprietary business processes, methodologies and systems.   
 
     The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$173 million during the first
quarter of 2014, primarily due to amortization, partially offset by intangible
asset additions resulting from acquisitions. The aggregate intangible
amortization expense for acquired intangibles (excluding capitalized software)
was $339 million and $331 million for the quarters
ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, in the first three
months of 2014, the company retired $164 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.  
 
     The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following
at March 31, 2014:

12.  Contingencies:  As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries,
IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a
leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will
continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated
products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement
and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company
enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations,
lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and
scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions
involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters
related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may
involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel
questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters
arise. 
 
       The
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities,
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2014
were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
       In
accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides
disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least
reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on
its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the
experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and
employee relations considerations. 
 
       With
respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any
material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court
rulings, and/or the 

33

 

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

strength of the company’s defenses
in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations
and proceedings discussed in this note, the company is unable to provide
estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in
excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company’s
experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable
and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators
of the company’s potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide
such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims,
suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the
procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel
legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information
important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to
recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or
range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and
status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive
rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular
matter. 
 
       Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the
Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of
the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the
company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of
these matters. 
 
       The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company. 
 
       The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to Federal
Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of
AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its
decision. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and
all proceedings in this case were stayed. On August 25, 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware approved the appointment of a Trustee of
SCO. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a
trial in March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and
UnixWare copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to
recognize Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of
UNIX license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In
June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v. IBM case.  On July
10, 2013, the Court entered an order dismissing seven of SCO's ten claims,
specifically its breach of contract and copyright claims, and one tortious
interference claim.
 
       On May
13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on behalf of the Indiana Family
and Social Services Administration) sued one another in a dispute over a 2006
contract regarding the modernization of social service program processing in
Indiana. The State terminated the contract, claiming that IBM was in breach,
and the State is seeking damages. IBM believes the State’s claims against it
are without merit and is seeking payment of termination amounts specified in
the contract. After six weeks of trial, on July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior
Court in Marion County rejected the State’s claims in their entirety and
awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the
Indiana Court of Appeals reversed portions of the trial judge’s findings, found
IBM in material breach, and ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to
determine the State’s damages, if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also
affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial court’s award of damages to
IBM. This matter remains pending in the Indiana courts.    
 
      
On April 16, 2014, Iusacell SA de C.V. (Iusacell) sued IBM, claiming that IBM
made fraudulent misrepresentations that induced Iusacell to enter into an
agreement with IBM Mexico. Iusacell claims $2.5 billion in damages for lost
profits. Iusacell’s complaint relates to a contractual dispute in Mexico, which
is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico initiated by IBM
Mexico against Iusacell for breach of the underlying agreement. 
 
       IBM
United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal proceedings in May 2010 before
the High Court in London against the IBM UK Pensions Trust (the UK Trust) and
two representative beneficiaries of the UK Trust membership. IBM UK is seeking
a declaration that it acted lawfully both in notifying the Trustee of the UK
Trust that it was closing its UK 

34

 

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

defined benefit plans
to future accruals for most participants and in implementing the company’s new
retirement policy. On April 4, 2014, the High Court acknowledged that the
changes made to its UK defined benefit plans were within IBM’s discretion, but
ruled that IBM breached its implied duty of good faith both in implementing
these changes and in the manner in which it consulted with employees. This
judgment contemplates a future hearing to determine what remedies are
available. In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290 individual
actions brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined benefits plans
who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive dismissal and age
discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK
and are currently stayed. 
 
       In a
separate but related proceeding, in March 2011, the Trustee of the IBM UK Trust
was granted leave to initiate a claim before the High Court in London against
IBM UK and one member of the UK Trust membership, seeking an order modifying
certain documents and terms relating to retirement provisions in IBM UK’s
largest defined benefit plan (the C Plan) dating back to 1983. The trial of
these proceedings began in May 2012 and finished in early June. On October 12,
2012, the High Court in London issued its ruling, holding that the 1983 Trust
Deeds and Rules should be modified to allow certain categories of current IBM
UK employees who are members of the C Plan to retire from the age of 60 (rather
than from the age of 63) without actuarial reduction of their defined benefit
pension. In a supplementary ruling on December 13, 2012, the Court declined to
similarly modify the Trust Deeds and Rules for former employees who were C Plan
members and who left the company prior to retirement.  On February 7, 2013, the
Court issued an order agreed to by all parties, under which there will be no
appeals of the October 2012 and December 2012 judgments.  As a result of the
October 2012 ruling, IBM recorded an additional pre-tax retirement-related
obligation of $162 million in the third quarter of 2012.
 
      
On March 24, 2014, in a suit brought by local Works Councils, the Supreme Court
of Spain held that IBM Spain’s defined contribution (DC) plan implemented in
1993 was null and void, and held that current employees could reinstate their
rights to a defined benefit (DB) plan, although with an offset for DC
contributions paid to date.  The Court held that IBM Spain did not consult with
the Works Councils in seeking the voluntary participation of employees in
changing the pension scheme, and recommended that IBM Spain and the Works
Councils engage in discussions over how to carry out the offset. The ruling is
declaratory only and there have been no quantifications of, or suits for,
individual remedies. IBM Spain is considering its options for appeal.  
 
       In
March 2011, the company announced that it had agreed to settle a civil
enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to
alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA). On July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011 settlement
and required that for a two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC and the
court on certain matters, including those relating to compliance with the FCPA.
In early 2012, IBM notified the SEC of an
investigation by the Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau involving
allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM Poland employee in connection
with sales to the Polish government. IBM is cooperating with the SEC and Polish
authorities in this matter. In April 2013, IBM learned that the U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating allegations related to the Poland matter, as well as allegations relating to transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The DOJ is also seeking information regarding the company's global FCPA
compliance program and its public sector business. The company is cooperating
with the DOJ in this matter.
 
      
In May 2013, IBM learned that the SEC is conducting an investigation into how
IBM reports cloud revenue.  IBM is cooperating with the SEC in this matter.  
 
      
In December 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York related to the
company’s third-quarter 2013 financial results disclosure. The company, its
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and a former Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of the company are named as defendants.
Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated Section 20(a) and Section10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
 
       The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the
Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages
in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former manufacturing
and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek punitive
damages in an unspecified amount.  
 
       The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or 

35

 

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements – (continued)

laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially
responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of
fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental
investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several
current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative
orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and
is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former
operating sites. 
 
       The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters include claims for taxes on the importation of
computer software. In November 2008, the company won a significant case in the
Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil, and in late July 2009, the company received written confirmation regarding this decision.
The total potential amount related to the remaining matters for all applicable
years is approximately $720 million. The company believes it will prevail on
these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.      
 
13. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $6,103 million and $5,028 million at March 31, 2014
and December 31, 2013, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available
to the company’s business partners to support their working capital needs. In
addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients
in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $1,589 million
and $1,769 million at March 13, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
 
       The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 
       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the
assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the
company’s payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the
company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by
the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $45 million and $44 million at March 13,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.
 
       Changes in the company’s warranty
liability for standard warranties and deferred income for extended warranty
contracts are presented in the following tables:

14. Subsequent
Events: On April 29, 2014, the company announced that the Board of
Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per common share. The dividend
is payable June 10, 2014 to shareholders of record on May 9, 2014. The dividend
declaration represents an increase of $0.15 per common share, which is 16
percent higher than the prior quarterly dividend of $0.95 per common share.

Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on pages 57 and 58 for additional information.
 
Operating
(non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
        In an effort to provide better transparency into the
operational results of the business, the company separates business results
into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP
measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges and
retirement-related costs, and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions,
operating earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and
acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development,
transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses and tax
charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the
company characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating.
The company includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit
plan service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined
contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost
includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan
interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial
gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and
multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs and other costs.
Non-operating costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and
liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and the company
considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the
business.

 

38

 

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

       Overall, the company believes that providing
investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides
increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the
business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves
visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational
performance; enables better comparisons to peer companies; and allows the
company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward.
For its 2015 road map, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish
its objectives and track its progress. The company’s reportable segment
financial results reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company’s
management and measurement system.

Financial Performance
Summary:
 
       In the first quarter of
2014, the company reported $22.5 billion in revenue, expanded gross margin and
delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.29 as reported and $2.54 on an
operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $3.3 billion in cash from
operations and $0.6 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter driving
shareholder returns of $9.2 billion in gross common stock repurchases and
dividends. 
 
     The company’s performance
in the first quarter reflects the actions it is taking to transition to key
growth areas and to transform parts of the business. In the first quarter the
company:


·        
Announced a $1.2 billion
investment to globally expand its SoftLayer cloud hubs.
·        
Launched BlueMix, a new platform-as-a-service
to speed deployment of hybrid clouds.
·        
Acquired Aspera and Cloudant to
extend the company’s big data and cloud capabilities.
·        
Expanded the ecosystem around
OpenPOWER.
·        
Created an integrated business
unit around IBM Watson and announced a $1 billion investment to bring cognitive
capabilities to the enterprise. 
 
       The company is also
taking portfolio actions to divest businesses that no longer fit its strategic
portfolio. In January 2014, the company: 


·        
Completed the initial closing for
the divestiture of the customer care business process outsourcing business.
·        
Announced an agreement to sell its
x86 industry standard server business to Lenovo.
  
       In addition, as
expected, the company took a substantial workforce rebalancing charge to align
its resources and skills to the demand profile. This charge significantly
impacted the financial results in the first quarter, but the company expects
the action to pay back within the current year. Many of the actions taken in
the first quarter will impact the company’s revenue and profit in the short
term, but are expected to have long term benefits.
 
       The company has
continued to shift its investments to address the key trends in information
technology (IT) – driven by data and cloud and changes in the way individuals
are engaging. Across the business, the company had good performance in the
first quarter of 2014 in the offerings that address these shifts. Business
analytics revenue increased 5 percent as reported and 6 percent at constant
currency on a large base. Cloud revenue increased over 50 percent, with the
cloud delivered as a service content doubling year to year. In addition, in the
first quarter, the company had strong growth in mobile and security compared to
the prior year. 
 

39

 

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

     Segment
revenue was led by Software which increased 1.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency), driven by key branded middleware which increased 4.4 percent (5
percent adjusted for currency). The company is continuing to see strong client
demand and strong results in the key areas of mobile, cloud and security where
it has been targeting its investments. Total Global Services revenue declined
2.0 percent as reported, but increased 0.3 percent at constant currency;
adjusting for the divested customer care business, total Global Services
revenue increased 2 percent at constant currency with growth in both Global
Technology Services and Global Business Services. The first quarter growth
reflects the company’s expanded cloud offerings, contribution from some of the
large outsourcing contracts signed in 2013, and good performance in Consulting
and Systems Integration. Systems and Technology revenue decreased 23.0 percent
(23 percent adjusted for currency) from a combination of secular and cyclical
challenges. The company is dealing with challenges in its hardware business
models specific to Power, Storage and System x. The business has taken actions
to address these business model challenges including; 1) selling the industry
standard server business to Lenovo, 2) repositioning Power and building an
ecosystem around OpenPOWER, and 3) rightsizing the Power and Storage businesses
to the market dynamics. System z mainframe revenue decreased 39.7 percent (40
percent adjusted for currency). The decline in System z revenue reflects that
the product is six quarters into this product cycle, though on solid ground
secularly. 
 
     From a geographic
perspective, revenue in the growth markets declined 10.7 percent as reported
and 5 percent adjusted for currency, a one point improvement from the fourth
quarter at constant currency. The company views the bulk of the challenges in
the growth markets as cyclical, and believes that the opportunity in the growth
markets remains attractive over the long term. The company is continuing to
invest in these key markets to capture that opportunity.
 
     In the first quarter,
total consolidated revenue decreased 3.9 percent, 2.4 percent at constant
currency. Adjusting for the divested customer care business, revenue decreased
1 percent at constant currency. This performance represents a 2 point
sequential improvement at constant currency from the fourth quarter of 2013.
The constant currency growth in Software, Global Services and Global Financing
was offset by the decline in Systems & Technology. The currency impact to
revenue was 1.6 points in the first quarter of 2014. Currency was also a
headwind to profit performance — reflecting impacts from the Yen and the
devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. 
 
     The consolidated gross
profit margin increased 1.3 points versus the first quarter of 2013 to 46.9
percent. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 47.6 percent increased 0.9
points year to year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by margin
improvements in Global Services and an improved mix toward Software, partially
offset by a margin decline in Systems & Technology. 
 
     Total expense and other
(income) increased 6.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the
prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 7.9
percent year to year. The year-to-year drivers were approximately:

       There were several items that had an impact on total
expense and other (income) year to year. Workforce rebalancing charges in the
first quarter of 2014 were $873 million, an increase of $853 million versus the
first quarter of 2013.  In the first quarter of 2014, the company recorded a
gain of $98 million related to the divestiture of the customer care business. A
gain of a similar amount is expected in the second quarter of 2014 as the
remaining country closings are completed. Adjusting for these items, operating
(non-GAAP) base expense would have improved by 4 points compared to the 7 point
impact as highlighted above. The 4 point improvement is more indicative of the
productivity in the base expense. Within base expense, the company is
continuing to shift spending to areas where it sees future growth. As an
example, the $1.5 billion of research and development spending in the first
quarter of 2014 reflects the shift of development priorities to the growth
areas. The recent launch of BlueMix is a great example — the company will be
investing $1 billion to deliver unique platform-as-a-service capabilities to connect
enterprise data and applications to the cloud.

       Pre-tax income decreased 17.3
percent year to year and the pre-tax margin was 13.3 percent, a decrease of 2.1
points versus the first quarter of 2013. Net income decreased 21.4 percent and
the net income margin was 10.6 percent, a decrease of 2.3 points year to year.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.0 percent, an increase of
4.1 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income decreased 19.1
percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin was 14.7
percent, a decrease of 2.7 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) net income
decreased 21.7 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) net income margin of 11.8
percent decreased 2.7 points compared to the prior year. The operating
(non-GAAP) effective tax rate was 20.0 percent versus 17.3 percent in the first
quarter of 2013.
 
       Diluted earnings per share of $2.29 decreased 15.2 percent
versus the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.54
decreased $0.46 or 15.3 percent versus the first quarter of 2013. In the first
quarter, the company repurchased 45.2 million shares of its common stock. 
        
       At March 31, 2014,
the company’s balance sheet and liquidity positions remained strong and are
well positioned to support the business over the long term. Cash and marketable
securities at quarter end were $9,704 million, a decrease of $1,361 million
from December 31, 2013. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows
are:
 
      
Total assets decreased $3,577 million ($3,648 million adjusted for currency)
from December 31, 2013 driven by:
 
·        
Decreases in total receivables
($3,012 million) and cash and cash equivalents ($1,307 million); partially
offset by
 
·        
Increased prepaid pension assets
($559 million). 
 
      
Total liabilities increased $2,612 million ($2,493 million adjusted for
currency) from December 31, 2013 driven by:
 
·        
Increases in total debt ($4,262
million), deferred income ($1,058 million) and other accrued expenses and
liabilities ($717 million); partially offset by 


·        
Decreases in taxes payable ($2,388
million) and accounts payable ($596 million).
 
      
Total equity of $16,740 million decreased $6,189 million from December 31, 2013
as a result of:
 
·        
Increased treasury stock ($8,370
million) driven by share repurchases; partially offset by


·        
Higher retained earnings ($1,390
million), decreased losses in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
($446 million) and higher common stock ($349 million).
      
     The company generated $3,326 million in cash flow
provided by operating activities, a decrease of $697 million compared to the
first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by cash tax payments of $2,594 million,
an increase in the use of cash of $1,375 million. Investing activities provided
$35 million in cash flow in the first quarter of 2014 compared to a use of cash
of $1,012 million in the first quarter of 2013. This year-to-year decrease in
the use of cash was primarily due to lower cash used for net purchases of
marketable securities and other investments ($1,098 million). Net cash used in
financing activities of $4,673 million increased $1,957 million compared to the
prior year, primarily due to increased cash used for gross common stock
repurchases ($5,572 million), partially offset by higher net cash proceeds from
total debt ($3,743 million).
 
       In April 2014, the company stated that it is
expecting GAAP earnings per share of at least $17.00 and operating (non-GAAP)
earnings of at least $18.00 per diluted share for the full year 2014. The
company also stated that its earnings per share expectation does not include
the expected gain from the divestiture of its System x server business to
Lenovo due to the uncertainty of the timing and the amount. The gain will
ultimately be reflected in the company’s results, and the company will provide
an update later in the year.

Global Services
 
        In the first quarter of 2014, the
Global Services segments, Global Technology Services (GTS) and Global Business
Services (GBS), delivered revenue of $13,813 million, a decrease of 2.0 percent
as reported, but up 0.3 percent at constant currency compared to the prior
year. Normalizing for the divestiture of the company’s customer care business,
Global Services revenue decreased 0.5 percent as reported, but increased 2
percent adjusted for currency.  Adjusted for the divestiture, this is the third
consecutive quarter of constant currency growth in total Global Services.
Pre-tax income in the first quarter declined 13.7 percent and pre-tax margin
declined 1.9 points to 13.9 percent; excluding workforce rebalancing charges in
both periods, pre-tax income increased 7.1 percent with a pre-tax margin of
17.3 percent, up 1.5 points year to year.

  Global Technology Services
revenue of $9,330 million decreased 2.9 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2014. Normalizing for the divestiture of the
customer care business, revenue decreased 0.7 percent, but increased 2 percent
adjusted for currency. Within GTS, the Softlayer platform, which provides a highly
differentiated solution for clients looking to deploy across public, private or
hybrid clouds all unified on one platform, continued to perform well and contributed
about 1 point of constant currency growth for total GTS in the first quarter.
The company announced it will invest $1.2 billion to expand its global cloud
footprint and will double the number of its Softlayer centers — with 40 cloud
centers in 15 countries, they will be located in every major geography and key
financial center. GTS Outsourcing revenue declined 5.0 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) compared with the prior year. Normalizing for the
customer care divestiture, revenue declined 1.3 percent as reported, but
returned to growth on a constant currency basis with an increase of 1 percent
year to year. This growth was driven by new contracts that were brought on
during 2013. 
 
       Global
Business Services revenue of $4,483 million was flat year to year, but
increased 2 percent at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration
(C&SI) revenue grew 3.1 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency). This
growth was driven by the practices that address the Digital Front Office. The
company delivered growth across cloud and business analytics, and in projects
for clients on systems of engagement and helping clients connect these
front-end capabilities to their back-end systems and processes. A good
indication of this success is the company’s number one ranking in both Overall
Business Consulting and Cloud Professional Services by IDC, and Mobility
Consulting Services by Forrester. The company continues to invest strategically
and committed $100 million in March, 2014 to expand its consulting services
capability with ten new IBM Interactive Labs and 1,000 experts to address
client experience design and engagement. Application Outsourcing revenue
decreased 10.3 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting increased
pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in
elective projects.

       GTS first quarter gross profit grew 0.3 percent and
its gross profit margin improved 1.2 points to 37.9 percent versus the prior
year. Pre-tax income decreased 15.1 percent to $1,345 million and the pre-tax
margin declined 2.0 points to 14.1 percent.  Normalizing for workforce
rebalancing charges of $325 million and $4 million in the first quarter of 2014
and 2013, respectively, GTS pre-tax income grew 5.2 percent and pre-tax margin
expanded 1.3 points. GTS pre-tax income for the quarter included a gain of $98
million related to the customer care divestiture, however the business
performance has also been impacted by the divestiture of those operations. The
company continues to make investments in key growth areas such as mobile,
security and cloud. These initiatives are gaining traction, but they are not
yet at scale.

        Total Global Services
backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing, Consulting and
Systems Integration and Maintenance. Outsourcing backlog includes GTS
Outsourcing and GBS Outsourcing. Transactional backlog includes ITS and
Consulting and Systems Integration. Total backlog is intended to be a statement
of overall work under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations,
adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.
 
Global
Services signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s
commitment under a Global Services contract. There are no third-party standards
or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by
management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s
commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence
of termination charges or wind-down costs.
 
Signings
include GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems
Integration contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated
as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the company’s requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       Software revenue of
$5,661 million increased 1.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) year to
year in the first quarter of 2014. As enterprise clients continue to rely on the
company’s middleware solutions to transform their infrastructure and handle
their business critical transactions, first quarter growth was led by key
branded middleware. The company delivers software solutions through a
combination of on-premise and software-as-a-solution (SaaS) offerings. SaaS
offerings span across the software brands — and in the first quarter SaaS
revenue grew more than 25 percent year to year.
 
       Key branded middleware
revenue, which accounted for 65 percent of the total software revenue this
quarter, increased 4.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. 

 
       WebSphere had a strong
quarter with revenue increasing 12.0 percent (12 percent adjusted for
currency). For the thirteenth consecutive year, Gartner designated the company
the market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware
segment. The company’s market share of 30 percent is nearly double the size of
its closest competitor. The first quarter performance included continued strong
growth in MobileFirst, the comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and
services that enable clients to manage, integrate and leverage mobile devices. The
company has been building capabilities to address this space and now has over
3,000 mobile experts. Across software and services, the company’s mobile
business doubled in the first quarter compared to the prior year. The
application server business, which is an example of clients utilizing
on-premise software to manage the infrastructure workloads driven by mobile,
big data and analytics, delivered strong growth for the fourth consecutive
quarter.
 
       Information Management
revenue increased 1.3 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2014. This growth was led by distributed database and master data
management which are key elements of the company’s big data and analytics
solutions. With the first quarter acquisition of Cloudant, the company has
added DataBase-as-a-Service capability. Cloudant extends the company’s mobile
and cloud platforms by enabling developers to easily and quickly create next
generation mobile and web-based applications.
 
       Tivoli revenue
increased 6.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior
year with growth in all three product segments. Performance was led by Tivoli
security which increased 27.0 percent (28 percent adjusted for currency) year
to year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth at
constant currency. These strong results are being driven, in part, by incremental
requirements for security as clients expand into cloud and mobile computing.
Across the company, the portfolio of security offerings grew more than 20
percent in the first quarter versus the prior year. Tivoli storage, which
enables customers to manage their rapidly growing data, was up 3.7 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency), and Tivoli systems management increased 2.4
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.
 
       Workforce Solutions
revenue decreased 4.4 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter. Although there was strong growth in SaaS offerings, it was more than
offset by a decline in the on-premise Notes business. The company is working to
transform this business and build recurring revenue streams from the SaaS
offerings. 
 
       Rational revenue
increased 1.0 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) year to year in the
first quarter.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

      
Operating systems revenue decreased 10.2 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) and other software revenue was flat (increased 1 percent adjusted for
currency) year to year in the first quarter.
 
       In the first quarter of
2014, the company launched BlueMix which will make the company’s middleware
portfolio accessible via the cloud. With BlueMix, developers can efficiently
build cloud applications with reusable pieces of code tied to their enterprise
systems. This enables businesses to leverage the flexibility that cloud
applications provide.

       Systems and Technology revenue
decreased 23.0 percent (23 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter
of 2014 versus the same period in 2013. The decline in revenue reflects both
the product cycle of System z and the secular challenges in Power, Storage and
System x. In January 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement with
Lenovo to divest its System x business. Also, in the first quarter, the company
continued to reposition offerings in other parts of its hardware business to make
them more relevant, in addition to taking actions to realign its structure to
the demand profile the company projects going forward.  
   
      
System z revenue decreased 39.7 percent (40 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013. MIPS
(millions of instructions per second) shipments decreased 19 percent in
the first quarter of 2014 versus the same period in 2013. The decline in System
z revenue was expected as the product is in the sixth quarter of the product
cycle since general availability. In the current mainframe cycle, the company
has shipped approximately 26 percent more MIPS compared to the same period in
the prior cycle. System z is a core franchise which provides mission critical
infrastructure for the company’s clients, and the company continues to invest
in the platform. In April 2014, the company celebrated the mainframe’s 50th
year.
 
      
Power Systems revenue decreased 21.7 percent (21 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013. The
company is aggressively repositioning this platform with a couple of key
initiatives. First, the OpenPOWER consortium makes Power technology available
to an open development alliance. In the first quarter of 2014, the company
expanded its OpenPOWER ecosystem. Second, the company is expanding its Linux
capabilities through its POWER8 launch this year. POWER8 is the first processor
built for big data, and delivers better cloud economics.

        System
x revenue decreased 17.6 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) in the

       Storage revenue decreased
22.9 percent (23 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter
versus the comparable period in 2013. The company’s Flash solutions contributed
growth again this quarter, but high-end storage experienced substantial weakness
versus the first quarter of 2013.   
  
        Microelectronics OEM revenue decreased 15.9 percent (16
percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2014 versus the

       Systems and Technology’s gross
profit margin decreased 5.3 points in the first quarter of 2014 versus the
prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline due to revenue mix as a result
of less mainframe content (2.3 points), lower margins in Power Systems (1.7
points), Microelectronics (1.3 points) and Storage (0.9 points), partially
offset by higher margins in System z (0.2 points) and System x (0.1 points).
 
       Systems and Technology’s pre-tax loss
increased $255 million to a loss of $660 million in the first quarter 2014,
when compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin decreased 13.2 points in the first
quarter versus the prior year period. Normalized for workforce rebalancing
charges of $218 million and $3 million in the first quarter of 2014 and 2013,
respectively, Systems and Technology’s first quarter pre-tax income was a loss
of $442 million compared to a loss of $402 million in the prior year, and the
pre-tax margin declined 4.8 points.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

       Total geographic revenue of $22,129 million
decreased 3.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of
2014 compared to the prior year. While as reported revenue for the quarter
decreased year to year in both the major markets and growth markets, both
markets improved their growth rate at constant currency compared to the fourth
quarter of 2013. 
 
       Growth
markets revenue across all geographies decreased 10.7 percent as reported and 5
percent at constant currency in the first quarter. Revenue grew at a high
single-digit rate on a constant currency basis in Latin America, but revenue in
the Asia Pacific countries was down driven by continued weakness in China which
declined at a double-digit rate. This performance is consistent with the past
two quarters and it is expected to take some time for business to improve in
China. The company still sees good opportunity in the growth markets over the
long term and continues to invest in these key markets to capture this
opportunity.
 
      
Americas revenue decreased 4.4 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to the first quarter of 2013. This is consistent with performance in
the fourth quarter of 2013 on a constant currency basis. Within the major
markets, the U.S. was down 3.6 percent and Canada was down 9.6 percent (1
percent adjusted for currency). There was strong growth in software, but
hardware performance, especially in the U.S., remained a challenge. Revenue in
the Latin America growth markets decreased 2.8 percent as reported, but
increased 8 percent adjusted for currency. This performance was led by Brazil
which was flat year to year as reported, but increased 12 percent on a constant
currency basis.
 
       EMEA
revenue increased 4.1 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) year to year in
the first quarter of 2014. This represents a 3 point improvement compared to
last quarter’s growth rate.  This improvement was driven by growth in Germany
and Italy. Germany grew 13.1 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) and
Italy increased 9.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency). The UK increased
0.4 percent as reported, but decreased 6 percent year to year on a constant
currency basis. Revenue in the EMEA growth markets decreased 2.0 percent
(increased 1 percent adjusted for currency). Russia had strong performance
compared to recent quarters with growth of 12.4 percent (17 percent adjusted
for currency). 
 
       Asia
Pacific first quarter revenue decreased 12.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for
currency) year over year. Japan revenue decreased 7.8 percent as reported, but
increased 2 percent on a constant currency basis. Adjusted for currency, this
was the sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. The Asia Pacific
growth markets decrease of 15.8 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency) was
driven by China which declined 19.4 percent (20 percent adjusted for currency).
India was down 17.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) on a year-to-year
basis. 
 
       OEM
revenue decreased 16.8 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) year to year
in the first quarter of 2013, driven by the Microelectronics OEM business.

        Total
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 12.8 percent
(14 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first
quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily driven by higher base expense (12
points) and acquisition-related spending (2 points), partially offset by the
effects of currency (1 point). Operating (non-GAAP) SG&A expense increased
13.4 percent (15 percent adjusted for currency) primarily driven by higher base
expense (13 points) and acquisition-related spending (2 points), partially
offset by the effects of currency (1 point). Base expense includes workforce
rebalancing charges in the first quarter of 2014 of $873 million, an increase
of $853 million year to year, which resulted in a 16 point year-to-year impact
in the operating (non-GAAP) SG&A base performance.  Normalized for the
workforce rebalancing charges in both first-quarter periods, operating
(non-GAAP) SG&A base expense decreased 3 points year to year compared to
the 13 point impact above. Bad debt expense increased $32 million year to year
driven by specific provision additions. The receivables provision coverage was
1.8 percent at March 31, 2014, an increase of 20 basis points from year-end
2013 and 30 basis points from March 31, 2013.

        Other (income)
and expense was income of $126 million and $60 million in the first quarter of
2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in income of $65 million year over
year was primarily driven by the gain associated with the divestiture of the
customer care business ($98 million) in the first quarter of 2014 reflected in
Other in the table above. In addition, a reduction in losses on derivative
instruments ($397 million) year to year was more than offset by lower foreign
currency transaction gains ($458 million) year to year due to foreign currency
rate volatility.

       The increase in

was primarily driven by higher average debt levels. Interest expense is
presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only
if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external
business. See pages 63 and 64 for additional information regarding Global
Financing debt and interest expense. Overall interest expense (excluding

       In the first quarter, total retirement-related plans
cost decreased by $213 million compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily
driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($237 million) and higher
expected return on plan assets ($47 million), partially offset by higher
interest cost ($70 million). 
        As discussed in the “Snapshot” on page 38, the
company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others
as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related
costs in the first quarter were $419 million, a decrease of $52 million
compared to the first quarter of 2013, driven by lower defined contribution
plans cost ($33 million) and lower service cost ($19 million). Non-operating
costs of $123 million decreased $161 million in the first quarter compared to
the prior year driven primarily by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses
($237 million) and higher expected return on plan assets ($47 million),
partially offset by higher interest cost ($70 million). 
       See Note 8, "Retirement-Related Benefits,"
for additional plan cost detail.
  
Taxes
 
       The effective tax rate
for the first quarter of 2014 was 20.0 percent compared to an effective tax
rate of 15.9 percent for the first quarter of 2013. The operating (non-GAAP)
tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was 20.0 percent compared to 17.3
percent for the first quarter of 2013.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

       The lower rates in the
first quarter of 2013 benefitted from discrete period benefits associated with the retroactive impact of the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief
Act (approximately $135 million) and newly enacted state legislation
(approximately $125 million). In the first quarter of 2014, this year-to-year
impact was partially offset by an increased benefit due to a more favorable mix
of geographic income and an increase in the expected utilization of foreign tax
credits.  
  
       With respect to major
U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer
subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2008. The company is no longer
subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years
prior to 2011. The open years contain matters that could be subject to
differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates
to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax
benefits at December 31, 2013 increased by $25 million in the first quarter
of 2014 to $4,483 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $3,971 million at
March 31, 2014.
  
In April 2010, the company
appealed the determination of a non-U.S. local taxing authority with respect to
certain foreign tax losses. The tax benefit of these losses, approximately
$1,164 million, has been included in unrecognized tax benefits. In April 2011,
the company received notification that the appeal was denied. In June 2011, the
company filed a lawsuit challenging this decision. The company’s latest brief
was filed in December  2013. No final determination has been reached on this
matter. 
 
       In the fourth quarter
of 2013, the company received a draft tax assessment notice for approximately
$866 million from the Indian Tax Authorities for 2009. The company believes it
will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful
indicator of liability. At March 31, 2014, the company has recorded $454
million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance
represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the company’s right to
appeal various income tax assessments made by the Indian Tax Authorities.  
  
       In the first quarter of
2014, the IRS commenced its audit of the company’s U.S. tax returns for 2011
and 2012. The company anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end
of 2015.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

Financial
Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At March 31, 2014, the company continues to have a
high degree of financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet to support its
business objectives. Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $9,704
million. Total debt of $43,980 million increased $4,262 million from prior
year-end levels. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to
meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. In the first three
months of 2014, the company generated $3,326 million in cash from operations, a
decrease of $697 million compared to the first three months of 2013. The
company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and
continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital
markets and its $10 billion global credit facility. The company’s cash flow and
cash position permits the company to invest and deploy capital to areas with
the most attractive long-term opportunities.  
 
       The assets and debt associated with the Global
Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial
position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are
the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in
the separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 60, are supplementary
data presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.

described below:      
 
       Current assets decreased
$3,390 million (a decrease of $3,482 million adjusted for currency), due to:
 
·        
A decline of $2,175 million
($2,242 million adjusted for currency) in short-term receivables primarily due
to collections of higher year-end balances; and 
 
·        
A decrease in cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities of $1,361 million.
 
 
       Current liabilities
increased $904 million ($861 million adjusted for currency), as a result of:
 
·        
An increase in short term debt of
$2,449 million ($2,440 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by a
reclass from long-term debt to reflect maturities (see debt analysis on page
55) and increases in commercial paper; 
 
·        
An increase in deferred income of
$1,124 million ($1,086 million adjusted for currency) due to annual Software
and Global Services customer billings and contract renewals, partially offset
by
 
·        
A decrease in taxes payable of
$2,388 million ($2,392 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to tax
payments in the U.S. and Japan.
  
 
Cash Flow
 
       The company’s cash flow from operating, investing

profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access
global funding sources as needed.

       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate
long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset
portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on pages 63
and 64.
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
       “Core” debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding
Global Financing debt and equity) was 55.3 percent at March 31, 2014 compared
to 39.0 percent at December 31, 2013 and 34.3 percent at March 31, 2013. Given
the expected skew of the company’s cash from operations and free cash flow, the
company expects its “core” debt-to-capitalization ratio to remain in the 50
percent range for the second and third quarters, and be approximately flat year
to year at the end of 2014.         
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio at March
31, 2014 was 72.4 percent versus 63.4 percent at December 31, 2013 and 63.5
percent at March 31, 2013.   
 
Equity
 
       Total equity decreased by $6,189 million from
December 31, 2013 as a result of an increase in treasury stock of $8,370
million related to gross common stock repurchases in the first three months of
2014, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $1,390 million, a
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $446 million and an
increase in common stock of $349 million.
 
Looking Forward  
 
       The company measures the success of its
business model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The
company’s strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective
of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the
company is well-positioned to take advantage of major shifts occurring in
technology, business and the global economy. 
 
       In May 2010, the company met with
investors to describe how the company manages its business, allocates its
capital and serves its shareholders in a detailed discussion of its strategy.
The company discussed how it continuously changes its business mix and resource
allocation toward higher value, higher growth market opportunities. The company
also discussed its transformation to a globally integrated enterprise and how
this has allowed the company to capture new growth and productivity. The
company highlighted that by aligning its business model with its clients’
needs, the company can achieve 

55

 

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

its financial goals
which will allow the company to invest in future sources of growth and provide
strong returns to its shareholders. This delivers long-term value and
performance to all key stakeholders. The execution of the company’s strategy
results in the 2015 road map — with the expectation of at least $20 of
operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share in 2015. 
  
       Within the IT industry, there are major
shifts occurring – driven by data, cloud and changes in the way individuals are
engaging. In the first quarter, the company had good performance in its
offerings that address these shifts, including business analytics, cloud,
mobile and security. As important, the company continues to take significant
actions to move to these growth areas – examples include the targeted
investments in SoftLayer capacity, the BlueMix launch and IBM Watson. The
company is focused on allocating its capital efficiently and effectively –
which means investing in the right places, as well as moving away from areas
that do not support the company’s shift to higher value. This is an important
part of the company’s model. Over the last few years, including the pending
sale of the industry standard server business, the company has divested over $6
billion of revenue. The result is a stronger, more relevant business.
 
        Looking forward in 2014, the company
expects continued good performance in the key growth areas; however, overall
revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in the hardware business and
the customer care divestiture. The customer care divestiture impacted
consolidated revenue growth in the first quarter by approximately 1 point, and
it is expected that the impact will be approximately 1-1.5 points for the
balance of the year. In addition, the divestiture of the System x server
business to Lenovo will impact revenue performance, although that impact cannot
be determined due to the uncertainty of the timing of the transaction closing.
The company’s gross margin will reflect the ongoing productivity initiatives
and actions to improve the cost base – as well as the relative strength of
software. As always, the company expects to reinvest a portion of the
productivity savings to drive the growth areas. The company also expects to
continue to return value to its shareholders. In April 2014, the company
disclosed that it is expecting GAAP earnings of at least $17.00 and operating
(non-GAAP) earnings of at least $18.00 per diluted share for the full year
2014. The operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share expectation exclude acquisition-related
charges of $0.72 per share and non-operating retirement-related costs of $0.28
per share. This expectation results in an increase year to year of 13.8 percent
in GAAP earnings per share and an increase of 10.5 percent year to year in
operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share, keeping the company on track to its
2015 objective. The company’s earnings per share expectation for 2014 does not
include any gain from the sale of its System x server business due to the
uncertainty of the timing of the transaction and the amount of the gain. The
gain will ultimately be reflected in the company’s results, and the company
will provide an update later in the year. The company's financial performance
in the first quarter was impacted by the current year workforce rebalancing
charges which were a primary driver of the year to year earnings per share
decline. In the second quarter of 2013, the company recorded significant
workforce rebalancing charges; as a result, without a similar impact, the
company expects second quarter 2014 earnings per share to improve compared to
the prior year. For the first half of 2014, the company expects to deliver
approximately 38 percent of its full year operating (non-GAAP) earnings per
share expectation. For the second half of 2014, the company expects growth
consistent with its full year expectation of a 10.5 percent increase in
operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share. Given the transactional nature and
momentum in certain parts of the business, the company expects operating (non-GAAP)
earnings per share to grow more on a year to year basis in the fourth quarter
versus the third quarter.        
 
       From a segment perspective, the Software
business delivered increased revenue in the first quarter, driven by key
branded middleware. Normalized for workforce rebalancing charges, the business
grew pre-tax income in the first quarter. The company continues to see very
good opportunity for its software solutions, and expects the revenue growth
rate in Software to improve going forward in 2014. The improving growth rate in
revenue will drive profitability. The Global Services business delivered
constant currency revenue growth in the first quarter, adjusting for the
divested customer care business. Normalized for workforce rebalancing charges,
pre-tax income increased and the pre-tax margin expanded compared to the prior
year. The company expects Global Services to deliver revenue growth for the
rest of 2014 at rates similar to the first quarter, and overall, the company
expects Global Services to improve profit growth in 2014 at a mid-single digit
rate compared to the prior year. Systems and Technology revenue declined 23
percent in the first quarter of 2014 reflecting both the cyclical and secular
challenges that the company expects to continue. The company expects continued
hardware revenue declines for the remainder of 2014. The company’s focus for
the System and Technology business in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base on a
year to year basis. The repositioning of the Power platform, the announcement
of POWER8, new product announcements in Storage and the right-sizing of the
business will all contribute to this objective. The company expects these
actions, together with the divestiture of System x, will result in a smaller
and more profitable hardware business going forward. The company will remain a
leader in high-performance and high-end systems, in storage and in cognitive
computing, and the company will continue to invest in R&D for advanced
semiconductor technology. 
 
       Currency movements impacted the
company’s year to year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first
quarter of 2014. Revenue growth for the quarter was impacted by 1.6 points from
currency. Currency also impacted the company’s 

56

 

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

profit
performance. In April 2014, the company indicated that at current spot rates,
it expects the impact to revenue to moderate, but it does expect currency to
continue to impact profit going-forward. 
      
       The company’s free cash flow performance
in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year was significantly
impacted by cash tax payments. Historically, the company’s free cash flow
generation is skewed to the back end of the year. The company expects free cash
flow in 2014 to increase by approximately $1 billion year to year, including
the impacts of cash tax payments. Overall, cash tax payments are expected to be
a year-to-year headwind in 2014 of about $2 billion, with the majority of that
impact having occurred in the first quarter. 
 
        In the first quarter of 2014, as part
of its common stock repurchase program, the company repurchased 45.2 million
shares of its common stock expending approximately $8.2 billion in the period.
For the full year 2014, the company expects total share repurchase to be slightly
less than the 2013 amount of $13.9 billion. The company will continue to return
capital to its shareholders for the rest of 2014, however, it will be at a
reduced rate relative to the first quarter.
 
         The company expects, in the normal
course of business, that its effective tax rate and operating (non-GAAP) tax
rate will be approximately 20 percent in 2014. The rate will change year to
year based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits,
changes in tax laws and divestitures, as well as recurring factors including
the geographic mix of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign
dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects of various global
income tax strategies.
 
      
The company expects 2014 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be
approximately $2.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $800 million compared
to 2013. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December
31, 2013. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating
retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, a
decrease of approximately $100 million versus 2013. Non-operating
retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $350 million, a
decrease of approximately $700 million compared to 2013, driven by less
recognized actuarial losses. Cash disbursements for all retirement-related
plans are expected to be approximately $2.9 billion in 2014, an increase of
approximately $200 million compared to 2013.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At March 31, 2014, currency changes resulted in assets and
liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars
than at year-end 2013. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit
specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears
in the company’s 2013 Annual Report in Note D, “Financial Instruments –
Derivative Financial Instruments,” on pages 102 to 106. 


      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information
does not incorporate any operational actions that management may take in
reaction to fluctuating currency rates.  Currency movements impacted the
company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first quarter
of 2014. Based on the currency rate movements in the first three months of 2014,
total revenue decreased 3.9 percent as reported and decreased 2.4 percent at
constant currency versus the first three months of 2013. On a pre-tax income
basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities
resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions)
decrease of approximately $60 million in the first three months of 2014. The
same mathematical exercise resulted in a decrease of approximately $70 million
in the first three months of 2013. The company views these amounts as a
theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering
the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange 

57

 

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments,
it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period,
but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in
the marketplace.
 
      
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
      
The company continues to monitor the economic conditions in Venezuela. On
December 30, 2010, the official rate for essential goods was eliminated, with
no change to the SITME rate. In February 2013, the SITME rate was eliminated,
and the official rate was set at 6.3 bolivars fuerte (BsF) to the U.S. dollar. In March 2013, the Venezuelan government created a new
foreign exchange mechanism called the “Complimentary System of Foreign Currency
Acquirement” (or the “SICAD 1”). This system operates similar to an auction
system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be
used for specific import transactions. In December 2013, the Venezuelan
government published the SICAD 1 rate implied by the transactions settled in
these auctions, and issued Exchange Agreement No. 24 which clarified the use of
the SICAD 1 mechanism.  In January 2014, the government issued Exchange
Agreement No. 25, and significantly expanded the transactions that qualify for
use of SICAD 1 and stated that a new agency called the National Center of
Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX) would assume the role of CADIVI, which historically
controlled the sale and purchase of foreign currency in Venezuela. In February
2014, the Venezuelan government signed into law a plan to open a new exchange
control mechanism (“SICAD 2”), and indicated that the official rate of 6.3 BsF
per USD would increasingly be reserved for the settlement of USD denominated
obligations related to purchases of “essential goods and services.” In March
2014, the Venezuelan government published operating rules for SICAD 2 in
Exchange Agreement No. 27. SICAD 2 began operating on March 24, 2014. In March
2014, the company adopted the SICAD 1 rate of 10.7 BsF per USD. The SICAD 1 rate is more representative of the exchange rate
that will be used for the periodic auctions in SICAD
1 for many of the goods and services sold by the company’s Venezuelan
operations.  In the quarter ended March 31, 2014, the company recorded a
pre-tax loss of $31 million as a result of the devaluation in Other (income)
and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2014, the
company’s net asset position in Venezuela was $43 million. The company’s operations in Venezuela comprised
less than 1 percent of total 2013 and 2012 revenue, respectively.
 
       In
January 2014, the Argentinian government devalued its currency from 6
pesos to the U.S. dollar to 8 pesos to the U.S. dollar. This devaluation did
not have a material impact given the size of the company’s operations in
Argentina (less than 1 percent of total 2013 revenue).
  
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2013 Annual Report, on pages 65 to 67,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 65 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
three months ended, or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2014, those amounts are
$3.3 billion for net cash from operating activities, $9.7 billion of cash and
marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. In 2013, the term of the five-year global credit facility was
extended by one year, and now expires on November 10, 2018. See the 2013 Annual
Report on page 114 for additional information.    
 
     
The major rating agencies’ ratings on the company’s debt securities at March 31,
2014 appear in the table on page 59. The agency ratings remain unchanged from
December 31, 2013. The company’s indenture governing its debt securities and
its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate
the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount
of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of
the company’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s
ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit
facilities also include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest
expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500
million.
 
The company is in compliance with all of its significant
debt covenants and provides periodic certification to its lenders. The failure
to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with
respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of
default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such
event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.
 
    The company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions
in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the 

58

 

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

holders to declare an event of default and seek to
accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The
company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain
standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if
the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At March 31,
2014, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was
$441 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to
fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s
outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other
contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would
result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

      The table appearing on page 66 of the company’s
2013 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash flows
for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of the way
cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. The company prepares its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting
standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and
highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format
on pages 53 and 54. The following is management’s view of cash flows for the
first three months of 2014 and 2013 prepared in a manner consistent with the

        Free
cash flow of $631 million for the first three months of 2014 decreased $1,065
million year to year. The decrease was driven primarily by higher cash tax
payments of $2.6 billion, which were higher year to year $1.4 billion,
resulting from audit settlement payments and other prior period discrete tax
impacts that settled in the first quarter of 2014. Free cash flow was also impacted
year to year by higher workforce rebalancing payments and capital spending
increases, partially offset by lower compensation-related payments and lower
pension contributions. In the first three months of 2014, the company continued
to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $1.0
billion in dividends and $8.2 billion in gross common stock repurchases.    
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2013 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation,
future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the
capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such
an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more
completely described in Note 12, “Contingencies,” in this Form 10-Q. With
respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated
pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $600
million in 2014. Cash disbursements related to all retirement-related plans is
expected to be approximately $2.9 billion in 2014. Financial market performance
could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S.
countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. The company
is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not
possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan
funding regulations.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity
options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional
funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit
facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany
loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.  
 
        The company does earn a significant amount
of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The company’s policy is to indefinitely
reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and
accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a
portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional
U.S tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any,
associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the
company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign
subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for operations and obligations in the
U.S., the company could elect to repatriate these funds which could result in a
reassessment of the company’s policy and increased tax expense.

       The increase in revenue
in the first quarter, as compared to the same period in 2013, was due to:
 
·        
Growth in external revenue of 2.6
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency), due to an increase in financing
revenue (up 3.4 percent to $391 million); and
 
·        
Growth in internal revenue of 14.1
percent, due to increases in used equipment sales revenue (up 17.2 percent to
$507 million) and in financing revenue (up 1.6 percent to $110 million).
 
       The increase in external
financing revenue in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in
2013, was due to an increase in the average asset balance, partially offset by
lower asset yields. The increase in internal financing revenue in the first
quarter, compared to the same period in 2013, was due to higher asset yields.
        
       Global Financing gross
profit increased 13.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same
period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in used equipment sales gross
profit. The gross profit margin increased 2.8 points in the first quarter,
compared to the same period in 2013, due to a margin increase in used equipment
sales, partially offset by a margin decrease in financing and a shift in mix
away from higher margin financing activities.

Global Financing pre-tax income increased 10.7 percent to $596 million in the
first quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, due to higher gross
profit ($93 million), partially offset by increases in financing receivables
provisions ($26 million) and selling, general and administrative expenses ($10
million). The increase in financing receivables provisions was due to higher
specific reserve requirements in the current year.
 
      The decrease in return
on equity in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the same period of 2013,
was due to a higher average equity balance, partially offset by the increase in
after-tax income.

      page 64.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and services, but also
include OEM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients’ total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for systems products, as well as loans
for systems, software and services with terms generally from one to seven
years. Global Financing’s client loans are primarily for software and services
and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the
associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks
in the loan agreements which include covenants to protect against credit
deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client financing also includes
internal activity as described on pages 33 and 34 of the 2013 IBM Annual
Report.
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.

(continued)
 

        In addition to the actions previously described, in
certain circumstances, the company may take mitigation actions to transfer
credit risk to third parties.
 
       At March 31, 2014,
substantially all financing assets are IT related assets, and approximately 58
percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with
no direct exposure to consumers.

       Cash
collections of both commercial financing and client financing assets exceeded
new financing originations in both the first quarter of 2014 and 2013, which
resulted in a net decrease in financing assets in these periods. The increase
in originations was due to improving volumes in commercial financing. Internal loan financing with Global
Services is executed under a loan facility and is not considered originations.
 
      
 Cash generated by Global Financing was
deployed to pay intercompany payables and dividends to IBM as well as business
partners and OEM suppliers.

       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.2 percent at December 31, 2013, to 1.4 percent at
March 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in specific reserve requirements.
Specific reserves increased 11 percent from $279 million at December 31, 2013,
to $311 million at March 31, 2014. Unallocated reserves decreased 9 percent
from $113 million at December 31, 2013, to $103 million at March 31, 2014,
due to the decline in gross financing receivables. 
 
 
       Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was an increase of $33 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2014, compared to an increase of $7 million for the same
period in 2013. The year-to-year increase in bad debt expense was due to higher
specific reserve requirements, primarily in China, in the current year.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

 
 
Residual
Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment
returned at the end of a lease, represented 55.6 percent and 53.2 percent of
Global Financing's revenue in the first quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
The increase was due to a higher volume of used equipment sales for internal
transactions. The gross profit margins on these sales were 67.9 percent and
58.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase
in the gross profit margin was driven by a margin increase in internal sales
and a shift in mix toward higher margin internal equipment sales.
 
       The
table below presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2014 and March
31, 2014. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of
the related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31, 2014 is expected to
be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on
a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of
the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While primarily focused on IBM
products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM products. These
third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided for
by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for the
covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease
payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a
sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate
asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were
$86 million and $130 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013,
respectively. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of
direct financing leases were $46 million and $55 million for the financing
transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and March 31,
2013, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the
scheduled end of lease were $5 million and $8 million for the
financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and
March 31, 2013, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.5 million and $0.8
million for the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively.

        The company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of
approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed
of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans
are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying
the financing receivable and are based on arm's-length pricing. Both assets and
debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 61.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s
external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing
Results of Operations” on page 60 and in Segment Information on pages 25 and
26.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of Global Services’
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Management Discussion –

(continued)
 

Looking Forward
 
        Global Financing's
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s
assets and new financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed
to the company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing
assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term commercial
paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A protracted period
where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown
in originations.  
 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As discussed on page 63, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global
Financing has policies in place to manage each of the key risks involved in
financing. These policies, combined with product and client knowledge, should
allow for the prudent management of the business going forward, even during
periods of uncertainty with respect to the global economy.
