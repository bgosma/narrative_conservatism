Table of Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation:  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements and footnotes thereto are unaudited. 
In the opinion of the management of the International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), these statements include all adjustments, which are
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs,
expenses and gains and losses not affecting retained earnings that are reported
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.  Actual results may be different. See the
companys 2007 Annual Report for a discussion of the companys critical
accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in
this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys 2007
Annual Report.
 
Within the financial tables
in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of
rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
 
2. Accounting
Changes:  In June 2008, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task
Force 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities, which will become effective in 2009
via retrospective application. Under the FSP, unvested share-based payment
awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings
per share (EPS) pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method
determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating
securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective
participation rights in undistributed earnings. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
granted to employees prior to December 31, 2007 are considered
participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalents
at the same rate as common stock. RSUs granted after December 31, 2007 do
not receive dividend equivalents and are not considered participating
securities. The company will adopt the FSP in fiscal year 2009. Upon
implementation, the company does not expect a material impact on diluted and
basic EPS. The implementation of the FSP is expected to decrease diluted EPS by
$0.01 for the third-quarter 2008 and by $0.03 for the nine months ended September 30,
2008. Basic EPS is expected to decrease by $0.01 for the third-quarter 2008 and
by $0.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.
 
In March 2008, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 expands the current disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, such that entities must now provide
enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses
derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under
SFAS No. 133 and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the
entitys financial position, financial results and cash flow. Pursuant to the
transition provisions of the Statement, the company will adopt SFAS No. 161
in fiscal year 2009 and will present the required disclosures in the prescribed
format on a prospective basis. This Statement will not impact the consolidated
financial results as it is disclosure-only in nature.
 
In February 2008, the
FASB issued FSP Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 157-1, Application of FASB
Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting
Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
Classification or Measurement under Statement 13, and FSP FAS 157-2, Effective
Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP FAS 157-1 removes leasing from the
scope of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FSP FAS 157-2 delays the
effective date of SFAS No. 157 from 2008 to 2009 for all nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at
least annually).  In October 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset
When the Market for That Asset is Not Active. FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the
application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example
to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP FAS 157-3
became effective immediately upon issuance, and its adoption did not have an
effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 6 on pages 13
and 14 for additional information regarding SFAS No. 157.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which will become
effective in 2009 via prospective application to business combinations. This
Statement requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to a
broader set of business combinations, amends the definition of a business
combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an acquirer to
recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date and
requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be
measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date (with
limited exceptions). The company will adopt this Statement in fiscal year 2009
and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of
business combinations subject to this statement.
 
In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement
requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be
accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the
treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest
and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional
disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the
controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 160, the company will adopt the Statement in fiscal year 2009 via
retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure requirements. The
company does not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material
effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,
which became effective January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities
to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally
accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is
irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings.
The company adopted this Statement as of January 1, 2008 but has not
applied the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities. Thus, the
adoption of this Statement did not affect the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
In September 2006, the
FASB finalized SFAS No. 157 which became effective January 1, 2008
except as amended by FSP FAS 157-1, FSP FAS 157-2 and FSP FAS 157-3 as
previously described. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements; however, it does not require any new fair value measurements. The
provisions of SFAS No. 157 were applied prospectively to fair value
measurements and disclosures for financial assets and financial liabilities and
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis beginning in
the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of this Statement did not have a
material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value
measurements made during the nine months ended September 30, 2008. While
the adoption of this Statement did not have a material impact on its
Consolidated Financial Statements, the company continues to monitor any
additional implementation guidance that is issued that addresses the fair value
measurements for certain financial assets, such as private market pension plan
assets, and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities not disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis. See Note 6
on pages 13 and 14 for additional information regarding the adoption of
this Statement.

The reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three
months ended September 30, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period
in the prior year, was principally the result of a reduction in the level of
stock option grants ($41 million), partially offset by an increase related to
restricted and performance-based stock units ($21 million).  The reduction in pre-tax stock-based
compensation cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, as
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was principally the
result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants ($160 million),
partially offset by an increase related to restricted and performance-based
stock units ($114 million). The effects on pre-tax stock-based compensation
cost related to the formation of a joint venture based on the companys
Printing Systems Division are included in Other (income) and expense above and
in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the nine-months period ended September 30,
2007.
 
As of September 30, 2008, the total
unrecognized compensation cost of $1,159 million related to non-vested awards
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
three years.
 
There were no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at September 30,
2008 and 2007.
 
For
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awarded after December 31, 2007, dividend
equivalents will not be paid. The fair value of such RSUs is determined and
fixed on the grant date based on the companys stock price adjusted for the
exclusion of dividend equivalents.

In
2008, the company expects to contribute to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans
approximately $660 million, which is the legally mandated minimum contribution
for its non-U.S. plans. Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first
nine months of 2008 were $425 million.
 
On April 29, 2008, the IBM Board of Directors
approved a pension adjustment for certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries.
Effective September 1, 2008, this adjustment provided a pension increase
to approximately 42,000 retirees who retired before January 1, 1997. The impact of this adjustment will be
included in the IBM Personal Pension Plan remeasurement at December 31,
2008, therefore, there will be no impact to 2008 net periodic pension cost.

The company received a $13.7
million subsidy in the third quarter and $33.9 million for the first nine
months of 2008 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by the company
to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the remainder is
contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the participants.
For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 115
in the companys 2007 Annual Report.
 
6. Fair
Value:  As highlighted in Note 2 on page 8, the
company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157-1
and  FSP FAS 157-2 on January 1,
2008, and FSP FAS 157-3 on October 10, 2008. Pursuant to the provisions of
FSP FAS 157-2, the company will not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157
until January 1, 2009 for the following major categories of nonfinancial
assets and liabilities from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position:
Plant, rental machines and other property-net; Goodwill; Intangible assets-net;
and, the Asset retirement obligation liabilities within Other accrued expenses
and liabilities and Other liabilities. The company recorded no change to its
opening balance of Retained earnings as of January 1, 2008 as it did not
have any financial instruments requiring retrospective application per the
provisions of SFAS No. 157.
 
Fair
Value Hierarchy
 
SFAS No. 157 specifies
a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those
valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use
based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) or
reflect the companys own assumptions of market participant valuation
(unobservable inputs). In accordance with SFAS No. 157, these two types of
inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
 



· Level 1 


Quoted prices in active
  markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for
  identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;




 


 




· Level 2 


Quoted prices for
  identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted
  prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial
  instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 




 


 




· Level 3 


Prices or valuations that
  require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
  unobservable.



 
SFAS No. 157 requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
Measurement
of Fair Value
 
The company measures fair
value as an exit price using the procedures described below for all assets and
liabilities measured at fair value. When available, the company uses unadjusted
quoted market prices to measure fair value and classifies such items within
Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon
internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based or
independently-sourced market parameters such as interest rates and  currency rates. Items valued using internally
generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in
Level 3 even though there may be inputs that are readily observable. If quoted
market prices are not available, the valuation model used generally depends on
the specific asset or liability being valued. The determination of fair value
considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value
underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and marketable debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument. In the event of an
other-than-temporary impairment of a nonpublic equity method investment, the
company uses the net asset value of its investment in the investee adjusted using
discounted cash flows for the companys estimate of the price that it would
receive to sell the investment to a market participant that would consider all
factors that would impact the investments fair value. In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers base valuations
calculated using the methodologies described below for several parameters that
market participants would consider in determining fair value.
 
· Counterparty credit risk adjustments are
applied to financial instruments, where the base valuation uses market
parameters based on an AA (or equivalent) credit rating. Due to the fact that
not all counterparties have a AA (or equivalent) credit rating, it is necessary
to take into account the actual credit rating of a counterparty to determine
the true fair value of such an instrument.
 
13





Table of Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
· Credit risk adjustments are applied to
reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at
fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing
counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit
risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
The following table presents
the companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis at September 30, 2008 consistent with the fair value
hierarchy provisions of SFAS No. 157.

The
  gross balances of derivative assets contained within prepaid expenses and

The
  gross balances of derivative liabilities contained within other accrued

At September 30, 2008,
the company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
 
Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
 
Certain assets are measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the
table above. These assets include equity method investments that are recognized
at fair value at the end of the period to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis and are included in the table above can also be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include public cost method
investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  The company did not record any
other-than-temporary impairment charges for these assets during the first nine
months of 2008.
 
7. Accelerated Share
Repurchase:  In May 2007, IBM International Group
(IIG), a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the company repurchased 118.8
million shares of common stock for $12.5 billion under accelerated share
repurchase (ASR) agreements with three banks.
 
Pursuant to the ASR
agreements, executed on May 25, 2007, IIG paid an initial purchase
price of $105.18 per share for the repurchase. The initial purchase price was
subject to adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of IBM common
stock over a settlement period of three months for each of the banks. The
adjustment also reflected certain other amounts including the banks carrying
costs, compensation for ordinary dividends declared by the company during the
settlement period and interest
benefits for receiving the $12.5 billion payment in advance of the anticipated
purchases by each bank of shares in the open market during its settlement
period.  The adjustment amount could be
settled in cash, registered shares or unregistered shares at IIGs option. Under
the ASR, IIG had a separate settlement with each of the three banks. The
first settlement occurred on September 6, 2007, resulting in a settlement
payment to the bank of $151.8 million. The second settlement occurred on December 5,
2007, resulting in a settlement payment to the bank of $253.1 million. The
third settlement occurred on March 4, 2008, resulting in a settlement
payment to the company of $54.2 million. The settlement amounts were paid in
cash at the election of IIG in accordance with the provisions of the ASR and
were recorded as adjustments to Stockholders equity in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position on the settlement dates. The adjusted average price paid per share during the ASR
period was $108.13, resulting in a total purchase price of $12,851 million
versus the original $12,500 million. The $351 million difference was settled in
cash.

8. Acquisitions: During the nine months ended September 30,
2008, the company completed 13 acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $6,451
million. The Cognos, Inc. and Telelogic, AB acquisitions are shown
separately given their significant purchase prices.
 
Cognos, Inc. (Cognos)  On January 31,
2008, the company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of
Cognos for consideration of $5,021 million consisting of $4,998 million of cash
and $24 million of equity instruments. Through this acquisition, IBM and Cognos
will become a leading provider of technology and services for business
intelligence and performance management, delivering the industrys most
complete, open standards-based platform with the broadest range of expertise to
help companies expand the value of their information, optimize their business
processes and maximize performance across their enterprises. The company
acquired Cognos to accelerate its Information on Demand strategy, a
cross-company initiative that combines the companys strength in information
integration, content and data management and business consulting services to
unlock the business value of information. Cognos was integrated into the
Software segment upon acquisition, and goodwill, as reflected in the table on page 16
has been entirely assigned to the Software segment. It is expected that 20-30
percent of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. The overall
weighted average useful life of the intangible assets acquired, excluding
goodwill, is 6.5 years.
 
Telelogic, AB (Telelogic)  On April 3, 2008,
IBM acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of Telelogic for cash
consideration of $885 million. Telelogic is a leading global provider of
solutions for automating and supporting best practices across the enterprise
from powerful modeling of business processes and enterprise architectures to
requirements-driven development of advanced systems and software. Telelogics
solutions enable organizations to align product, systems and software
development lifecycles with business objectives and customer needs to
dramatically improve quality and predictability, while significantly reducing
time-to-market and overall costs. Clients will benefit from the combined
technologies and services of both companies, providing them a wider range of
software and system development capabilities used to build complex systems.
Telelogic was integrated into the Software segment upon acquisition, and
goodwill, as reflected in the table on page 16 has been entirely assigned
to the Software segment. None of the goodwill will be deductible for tax
purposes. The overall weighted average useful life of the intangible assets
acquired, excluding goodwill, is 7.0 years.
 
Other Acquisitions  The company acquired 11
additional companies at an aggregate cost of $544 million that are presented in
the table on page 16 as Other Acquisitions.
 
The Software segment completed seven other
acquisitions, all privately held companies: in the first quarter; AptSoft
Corporation, Solid Information Technology, Net Integration Technologies Inc.,
and Encentuate, Inc; in the second quarter; 
Infodyne, Beijing Super Info and FilesX.
 
Global Technology Services (GTS) completed one
acquisition in the first quarter: Arsenal Digital Solutions, a privately held
company. Arsenal provides global clients with security rich information
protection services designed to handle increasing data retention requirements.
 
Global Business Services (GBS) completed one
acquisition in the first quarter: u9consult, a privately held company.
u9consult complements the companys existing capabilities in value chain
consulting.
 
Systems and Technology completed two acquisitions in
the second quarter: Diligent Technologies Corporation and Platform Solutions,
Inc (PSI), both privately held companies. Diligent will be an important component of IBMs New
Enterprise Data Center model, which helps clients improve IT efficiency and
facilitates the rapid deployment of new IT services for future business growth. PSIs technologies and skills, along with its
intellectual capital, will be integrated into the companys mainframe product
engineering cycles and future product plans. In the second quarter, $24 million
of the purchase price of PSI was attributed to the fair value of a dismissed
claim from a preexisting lawsuit between IBM and PSI and recorded in SG&A
expense. See note 14 on page 20 for additional information regarding this
litigation. Also, the company recorded a $24 million In-Process Research and
Development (IPR&D) charge related to this acquisition in the second
quarter.
 
Purchase price consideration for the Other
Acquisitions was paid all in cash. All acquisitions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.

Purchase price allocation at September 30, 2008 reflects immaterial
adjustments from the June 30, 2008 balances.
 
The acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions, and
accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded
at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items
that generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. For the Other Acquisitions, the
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 5.0 years. With the exception of goodwill, these identified
intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
lives. Goodwill of $444 million has been assigned to the Software ($122
million), Global Technology Services ($84 million) and Systems and Technology
($239 million) segments. Substantially, all of the goodwill related to Other
Acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes.
 
On
July 28, 2008, the company announced it signed a memorandum of
understanding to launch a tender offer to acquire ILOG, a publicly held
company. ILOG will add business rules management, optimization and
visualization technology to the software portfolio. The estimated purchase
price is approximately $333 million. This offer is subject to approval from
ILOG shareholders and all necessary regulatory clearances.
 
9. Printing Systems Divestiture:  In January 2007,
the company announced an agreement with Ricoh Company Limited (Ricoh), a
publicly traded company, to form a joint venture company based on IBMs
Printing System Division (a division of the Systems and Technology segment).
The company initially created a wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoPrint Solutions
Company, LLC (InfoPrint), by contributing specific assets and liabilities from
its printer business. The Printing System Division generated approximately $1
billion of revenue in 2006. The InfoPrint portfolio includes solutions for
production printing for enterprises and commercial printers as well as
solutions for office workgroup environments and industrial segments. On June 1,
2007 (closing date), the company divested 51 percent of its interest in
InfoPrint to Ricoh.  The company will
divest its remaining ownership to Ricoh quarterly over a three year period from
the closing date. At September 30, 2008, the companys ownership in
InfoPrint was 28.5 percent. See IBMs 2007 Annual Report, Note C, Acquisitions/Divestitures,
for additional information.

Other intangibles are
  primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business processes,
  methodologies and systems and impacts from currency translation.



 
The
net carrying amount of intangible assets increased $941 million during the
first nine months of 2008, primarily due to acquired intangible assets and
capitalized software additions, partially offset by amortization. The aggregate
intangible asset amortization expense was $331 million and $985 million for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, versus $295 million
and $875 million for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30,
2007, respectively. In addition, in the first nine months of 2008, the company
retired $818 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the
gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
 
The
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to
intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial

Net investment in
sales-type leases is for leases that relate principally to the companys
equipment and are for terms ranging from two to seven years. Net investment in
sales-type leases includes unguaranteed residual values of $916 million and
$915 million at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of $1,040 million and
$1,016 million and of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $161 million and
$127 million at those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial
financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts receivable
financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment
terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30
to 90 days.
 
Client loans
receivables relate to loans that are provided by Global Financing primarily to
the companys clients to finance the purchase of the companys software and
services. Separate contractual relationships on these financing arrangements
are for terms ranging from two to seven years. Each financing contract is
priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these separate financing agreements.
 
The company
utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for non-recourse
borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for borrowings were
$358 million and $258 million at September 30, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of September 30, 2008
and December 31, 2007.

12. Segments:
The tables on pages 65 and 66 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results
of the companys reportable segments consistent with the management system used
by the companys chief operating decision maker. These results are not
necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP. For example, employee retirement plan costs are developed
using actuarial assumptions on a country-by-country basis and allocated to the
segments based on headcount. Different results could occur if actuarial
assumptions that are unique to each segment were used. Segment performance
measurement is based on income before income taxes (pre-tax income). These
results are used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the performance
of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.
 
13. Restructuring-Related
Liabilities: The
following table provides a rollforward of the current and noncurrent liability
balances for actions taken in the following periods: (1) the
second-quarter of 2005; (2) the fourth-quarter 2002 actions associated
with the acquisition of the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting business; (3) the
second-quarter 2002 actions associated with the Microelectronics Division and
the rebalancing of both the companys workforce and leased space resources; (4) the
2002 actions associated with the hard disk drive (HDD) business for reductions
in workforce, manufacturing capacity and space; (5) actions taken in 1999;
and (6) actions that took place prior to 1994. See the companys 2007
Annual Report, Note Q on pages 99 and 100 for additional information on
the actions taken in 2005.

14. Contingencies:  The company is involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits,
investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of its business, including actions with respect to contracts,
intellectual property (IP), product liability, employment, benefits,
securities, foreign operations and environmental matters. These actions may be
commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, partners,
clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies,
stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does
business.
 
The
following is a summary of some of the more significant legal matters involving
the company.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and focus
the issues in the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for summary
judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its
decision. On August 10, 2007, the court in another suit, The SCO Group, Inc.
v. Novell, Inc., issued a decision and order determining, among other
things, that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights, and
obligating SCO to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims against IBM and
Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. At the request of the court in
SCO v. IBM, on August 31, 2007, each of the parties filed a status report
with the court concerning the effect of the August 10th Novell ruling on
the SCO v. IBM case, including the pending motions. On September 14, 2007,
plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case
were stayed.

On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc.
(PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. IBM filed its amended complaint on August 17, 2007 and asserted
claims for patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, copyright
infringement, tortious interference and breach of contract in connection with
PSIs development and marketing of a computer system that PSI says is
compatible with IBMs S/390 and System z architectures. IBM also sought a
declaratory judgment that its refusal to license its patents to PSI and certain
of its software for use on PSI systems does not violate the antitrust laws. IBM
seeks damages and injunctive relief. On September 21, 2007, PSI answered
the amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against IBM for alleged
monopolization and attempted monopolization, tying, violations of New York and
California statutes proscribing unfair competition, tortious interference with
the acquisition of PSI by a third party and promissory estoppel. PSI also
sought declaratory judgments of noninfringement of IBMs patents and patent
invalidity. In October 2007, PSI filed a complaint with the European
Commission claiming that the companys alleged refusal to do business with PSI
violated European competition law. The company responded to this complaint in
December. On January 11, 2008, the court in the New York lawsuit permitted
T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems, to intervene as a
counterclaim-plaintiff, and the court also permitted the company to file a
second amended complaint adding patent infringement claims against T3. On June 30,
2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a result of this transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed
all claims against each other. Litigation between the company and T3 continues.
 
In
October 2003, a purported collective action lawsuit was filed against IBM
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by
10 former IBM employees alleging, on behalf of themselves and allegedly
similarly situated former employees, that the company engaged in a pattern and
practice of discriminating against employees on the basis of age when it
terminated employees, both in connection with reductions in force and
individualized determinations (Syverson v. IBM). Initially, the District Court
dismissed the lawsuit on the basis of release agreements signed by all the
plaintiffs. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial courts finding
that the release barred these claims, and in January 2007, after denial of
IBMs petition for rehearing, the matter was returned to the trial court for
further proceedings. On October 3, 2007, the court dismissed with
prejudice plaintiffs claim for relief under the Older Workers Benefit Protection
Act, and dismissed with leave to amend plaintiffs claim asserting disparate
impact age discrimination with respect to individualized terminations. On November 6,
2007, plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint, amending the disparate impact
claim. IBM filed its answer on November 26, 2007, and discovery is
proceeding.
 
In
July 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York related to the companys disclosures
concerning first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity
compensation. Pursuant to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006,
the two lawsuits were consolidated into a single action captioned In re
International Business Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a
corrected consolidated amended complaint dated May 19, 2006, in which they
named the company and IBMs Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
as defendants and alleged that defendants made certain misrepresentations and
omissions in violation of Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 20,
2006, the Court denied a Motion to Dismiss that was filed by IBM. On March 12,
2007, the plaintiffs class was certified; class notifications were mailed on
or about May 30, 2007. On May 30, 2008, the Court granted preliminary
approval of a settlement of this action. On September 9, 2008, the court
granted final approval of the settlement. Class members did not file an
appeal of the courts judgment prior to the deadline. Therefore, the judgment
is final.
 
In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea
announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several
companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea
and LG Electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005)
and had also charged employees of some of those entities with, among other
things, bribery of certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea
and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in
these matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM
employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM
were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different
times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance,
which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter. In March 2008,
the company received a request from the SEC for additional information.

On
March 27, 2008, the company was temporarily suspended from participating
in new business with U.S. Federal government agencies.  The notice of temporary suspension was issued
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related to an investigation by
the EPA of possible violations of the Procurement Integrity provisions of the
Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act regarding a specific bid for business
with the EPA originally submitted in March 2006. In addition, the U.S.
Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia served the company and
certain employees with grand jury subpoenas related to the bid, requesting
testimony and documents regarding interactions between employees of the EPA and
certain company employees. On April 4, 2008, the company announced an
agreement with the EPA that terminated the temporary suspension order.  The company is cooperating with the EPA and
with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.
 
The
company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought in Tokyo District Court by
Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover losses that it allegedly
suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy)
proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo Leasing amounts for
which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others liable. The claims in this
suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in
the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and trespass.
Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages in
unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.
 
The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the
importation of computer software. The total amounts related to these matters
are approximately $2.3 billion, including amounts currently in litigation and
other amounts. In addition, the company has received an income tax assessment
from Mexican authorities relating to the deductibility of certain warranty
payments. In response, the company has filed an appeal in the Mexican Federal
Fiscal court. The total potential amount related to this matter for all
applicable years is approximately $550 million. The company believes it will
prevail on these matters and that these amounts are not meaningful indicators
of liability.
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5),
the company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are
reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the
impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information
pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities including any
changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, were
not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its experience,
the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters previously
referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims,
suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not
possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters previously discussed.
While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such
matters, it is possible that the companys business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period
by the resolution of one or more of these matters.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such
claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material
effect on the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and
amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies;
the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on
the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances
of the particular matter which may give rise to additional factors.
 
15. Commitments:  The
companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused
amounts of $4,643 million and $3,702 million at September 30, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $4,187 million and $3,654
million at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
 
The
company has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee
or indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required
by SFAS No. 5, by requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of
guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is
remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is
the guarantor.
 
The
company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters.
Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by
the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants
related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual
property (IP) rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance
of non-financial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of
these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party
making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract,
which procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other partys
claims. Further, the companys obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It
is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements
have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition
or results of operations.
 
In
addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The
maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $23
million at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position is not material.
 
The
company offers warranties for its hardware products that range up to three
years, with the majority being either one or three years. Estimated costs for
warranty terms standard to the deliverable are recognized when revenue is
recorded for the related deliverable. Revenue from extended warranty contracts,
for which the company is obligated to perform, is recorded as deferred income
and subsequently recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period.
Changes in the companys deferred income for extended warranty contracts and warranty
liability for standard warranties, which are included in other accrued expenses
and liabilities and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, are presented in the following tables:

16. Subsequent Events:  On October 28, 2008, the company announced that the Board of
Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share. The dividend
is payable December 10, 2008 to stockholders of record on November 10,
2008. 
 
On October 15, 2008,
the company issued $4.0 billion of 5, 10 and 30 year bonds. See Debt on page 48

The following Results of
  Continuing Operations discussion does not include the hard disk drive (HDD)
  business that the company sold to Hitachi, Ltd. on December 31, 2002.
  The HDD business was accounted for as a discontinued operation under
  generally accepted accounting principles. There were no losses from
  Discontinued Operations in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008
  and a $1 million loss in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2007.

1.7 percent adjusted for
  currency



 
Within the
Management Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at
constant currency are made so that the financial results can be viewed without
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby
facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the companys business
performance.
 
In the third
quarter, in a challenging economic environment, the company delivered solid
financial results. Total revenue increased 4.9 percent as reported, 1.7 percent
adjusted for currency, versus the third quarter of 2007. Pre-tax income from
continuing operations was $3,895 million, up 18.7 percent compared to the prior
year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.05, an
increase of 22.0 percent year to year.
 
The company
has been executing a strategy that has two major elements. In the emerging
markets, the company continues to invest to capture opportunities created from
the build out of the public and private infrastructures in these economies. In
the more established markets, the company has been focused on driving
productivity and improving efficiency while delivering transformational
solutions that provide high value to its clients.
 
The companys
focus on productivity has yielded a more efficient cost and expense structure.
The company benefited from these structural changes in the third quarter
delivering improved margins while revenue growth slowed in major markets.
 
In addition,
the companys solid base of annuity businesses provide a good revenue
foundation and a steady source of profit and cash. The company has built these
businesses over many years and they provide the company with advantages in the
current economic environment.
 
The companys
balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. At September 30,
2008, cash on hand was approximately $10 billion; in addition, the company
issued $4 billion in long-term debt on October 15, 2008 and continues to have
access to a $10 billion global credit facility.
 
24





Table
of Contents
 
The
companys third quarter financial results demonstrate that the combination of a
solid annuity base, investments for growth in emerging markets, a continued
focus on productivity, a range of products and services that deliver value to
clients and a strong balance sheet and liquidity position enable the company to
be well positioned in the current environment.
 
Total
geographic revenue increased 6.0 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to the third quarter of 2007. Americas revenue increased 2.9
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), Europe increased 10.1 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency) and Asia Pacific increased 5.8 percent (1
percent adjusted for currency). In the more established countries, which the
company manages through its major markets organization, U.S. revenue growth was
1 percent and Canada increased 6 percent, adjusted for currency. In Europe,
revenue adjusted for currency, increased 8 percent in Spain, 3 percent in the
U.K. and 2 percent in Germany, France and Italy, respectively. Japan revenue,
adjusted for currency, decreased 5 percent.
 
The company focuses on the
emerging markets through its new growth markets organization. These countries
represented 19 percent of the companys geographic revenue in the quarter and
grew 12.7 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency). A subset of these
countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, together grew 18.7 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency). The increase was driven by double-digit growth
in India of 23.7 percent (33 percent adjusted for currency), Brazil 27.9
percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) and Russia 51.4 percent (51 percent
adjusted for currency).
 
On a segment
basis, Software had the best revenue growth (11.8 percent), leveraging a
strong annuity base and acquisitions. Global Technology Services revenue
increased 8.5 percent, while Global Business Services revenue improved by 6.8
percent versus the third quarter of 2007, both driven by good short-term
signings performance. Systems and Technology revenue decreased 9.5 percent, as
this segment was most impacted by a slowdown in transactions at the end of the
quarter. Total Systems revenue declined 6.5 percent in the third quarter, with
growth in System z and converged System p partially offset by declines in
System x and legacy System i. Global Financing revenue increased 1.7 percent
reflecting an improvement in financing revenue of 6.1 percent, offset by a
decline in used equipment sales.
 
The gross profit margin was
43.3 percent, an increase of 2.0 points, primarily due to improved margins in
Global Business Services (0.9 points of the increase), Global Technology
Services (0.8 points of the increase) and improved segment revenue mix (0.4
points of the increase) driven by Software. 
These improvements were partially offset by a lower margin in Systems
and Technology which impacted the overall margin by 0.4 points.
 
Total expense and other
income increased 5.8 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) for the third
quarter of 2008 versus the third quarter of 2007. Overall, the increase was
driven by approximately 4 points due to the effects of currency and 5 points
due to acquisitions, with operational expense improving year to year.
 
The companys effective tax
rate for the third quarter of 2008 was 27.5 percent versus 28.0 percent in the
third quarter of 2007.
 
The company generated $3,738
million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $746
million, compared to the third quarter of 2007, primarily driven by changes in
operating assets and liabilities ($996 million), partially offset by increased
net income ($462 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,496
million was $1,708 million lower than the third quarter of 2007, primarily due
to net impact of purchases and sales of marketable securities and other
investments ($1,002 million) and acquisitions ($351 million). Net cash used in
financing activities of $1,881 million was $2,770 million higher, primarily due
to increased common stock repurchases ($2,522 million) in the third quarter of
2008 versus the third quarter of 2007.
 
In the third-quarter 2008,
total Global Services signings decreased 4 percent year to year to $12,675
million ($11,124 million adjusted for currency, down 5 percent). Short-term
signings were $6,097 million, an increase of 13 percent year to year (8 percent
adjusted for currency). Long-term signings were $6,578 million, a decrease of
16 percent (15 percent adjusted for currency). The estimated Global Services
backlog, at constant currency, was $114 billion at September 30, 2008,
down  $2 billion versus the June 30,
2008 balance and down $2 billion versus the September 30, 2007 balance.

3.7 percent adjusted for
  currency



 
For the first nine months of
2008, total revenue increased 9.6 percent as reported, 3.7 percent adjusted for
currency, versus the prior year. Pre-tax income from continuing operations was
$10,907 million, a 21.2 percent increase compared to the first nine months of
2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.68,
reflecting a 28.5 percent improvement year to year.
 
Americas revenue increased
6.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), Europe increased 15.2 percent (5
percent adjusted for currency) and Asia Pacific increased 11.8 percent (3
percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2008. In the
established countries, U.S. revenue growth was 4 percent and Canada increased 6
percent, adjusted for currency. In Europe, revenue adjusted for currency,
increased 9 percent in Spain, 4 percent in the U.K., 3 percent in Italy, 2
percent in France and 2 percent in Germany. Japan revenue decreased 3 percent
adjusted for currency year to year.
 
Across the geographies,
aggregate revenue from the growth market countries increased 17.2 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2008 and represented
approximately 18 percent of the companys geographic revenue. Revenue in the
key growth countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 25.0
percent (15 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2008
versus the first nine months of 2007.
 
The increase in year-to-date
revenue was driven by double digit growth in the Global Services segments.
Global Technology Services revenue increased 13.5 percent, while Global
Business Services revenue improved by 13.8 percent.  Software revenue increased 14.2 percent, led
by branded middleware and contributions from acquisitions. Systems and Technology
revenue decreased 4.5 percent primarily driven by weaker performance in
Microelectronics OEM, legacy System i, System x and the impact of the prior
year printer divestiture, partially offset by increased revenue for the new z10
mainframe and growth in converged System p servers and Storage. Total Systems
revenue growth was 1.9 percent in the first nine months. Global Financing
revenue increased 3.6 percent reflecting an improvement in financing revenue,
offset by a decline in used equipment sales.
 
The gross profit margin was
42.7 percent, an increase of 1.6 points, primarily due to improved margins in
Global Technology Services (0.8 points of the increase), improved segment
revenue mix driven by Software (0.2 points of the increase), improved margins in
Global Business Services (0.5 points of the increase) and improved margins in
Systems and Technology (0.1 points of the increase).

Table
of Contents
 
Total expense and other
income increased 10.4 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) for the first
nine months of 2008 versus the first nine months of 2007. Overall, the increase
was driven by approximately 6 points due to the effects of currency and 5
points due to acquisitions, with operational expenses lower year-to-year.
 
The effective tax rate for
the first nine months of 2008 was 27.5 percent versus 28.2 percent for the
comparable period in 2007.
 
The company generated $12,191
million in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $1,247
million, compared to the first nine months of 2007, primarily driven by
increased net income ($1,440 million), partially offset by decreases in changes
in operating assets and liabilities ($370 million). Net cash used in investing
activities of $8,405 million was $2,632 million higher than the first nine
months of 2007, primarily due to the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions ($5,299)
million, partially offset by the net impact of purchases and sales of
marketable securities and other investments ($2,966 million). Net cash used in
financing activities of $8,964 million was $4,845 million higher year to year,
primarily due to net payments associated with debt ($13,267 million), partially
offset by lower payments to repurchase common stock ($8,519 million).
 
Total assets decreased
$4,521 million (decreased $1,723 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2007, primarily driven by lower cash and marketable securities ($6,391 million),
lower financing receivables ($3,124 million), lower accounts receivable ($1,472
million) and lower investments and sundry assets ($1,235 million). These
decreases were partially offset by increases in goodwill ($4,576 million) and
intangible assets ($941 million) 
primarily due to the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions, prepaid pension
assets ($1,356 million) and prepaid expenses and other current assets ($823
million). The company had $9,755 million in cash and marketable securities at September 30,
2008.
 
Total liabilities decreased
$3,570 million (decreased $2,509 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2007, primarily due to accounts payable ($1,285 million), taxes ($1,176
million), debt ($861 million), other accrued expenses and liabilities ($577
million) and deferred income ($427 million). These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in other liabilities ($974 million).
 
Stockholders equity of
$27,519 million decreased $951 million from December 31, 2007, primarily
due to increased treasury stock ($9,626 million) as a result of common stock
repurchases, partially offset by higher retained earnings ($5,959 million) due
to net income and common stock ($3,686 million) driven by stock option
activity.

The companys Global
Services segments, Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, had
combined revenue of $14,764 million, an increase of 7.9 percent (4 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and $44,559 million, an increase of
13.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of
2008, respectively, when compared to same periods of 2007. Revenue growth in
the quarter continued to be driven primarily by short-term signings
performance, but as expected, the rate of growth slowed compared to strong revenue
growth in both segments in third-quarter 2007. In third-quarter 2008, total
Global Services signings decreased 4 percent year to year to $12,675 million
($11,124 million adjusted for currency, down 5 percent). Short-term signings
were $6,097 million, an increase of 13 percent year to year (8 percent adjusted
for currency). Short-term signings increased in both the growth markets and the
major markets with cost savings continuing to be the primary motivator.
Long-term signings were $6,578 million, a decrease of 16 percent (15 percent
adjusted for currency) compared to strong signings in the third quarter of
2007. Long-term signings declined in the major markets in the quarter, while
long-term signings in the growth markets increased approximately 60 percent.
The Global Services segments leveraged very strong margin performance and
delivered combined pre-tax profit of $1,913 million in the third quarter and
$5,111 million in the first nine months of 2008, an improvement of 23.5 percent
and 28.6 percent, respectively, versus the same periods of 2007. The strong
profit performance is a function of the quality of the segments  contracts portfolio and ongoing programs to
drive operational efficiencies and structural changes to the services cost
base.

Global
Technology Services (GTS) revenue increased 8.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for
currency) and 13.5 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, versus the third quarter
and first nine months of 2007. Total signings in GTS decreased 8 percent (7
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2008, with long-term
signings decreasing 17 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency) and
short-term signings increasing 19 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Strategic
Outsourcing (SO) revenue was up 7.5 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency)
in the third quarter and 12.1 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first nine months of 2008, respectively, versus the same periods in 2007.
Revenue increased 21 percent in the third quarter in the growth markets;
however growth in the major markets moderated in the quarter due to a number of
large contracts reaching a comparable year-over-year revenue basis and the
impact of the lower level of long-term signings over the last few quarters. SO
signings in the third quarter of 2008 decreased 19 percent (16 percent adjusted
for currency) when compared to the third quarter of 2007.
 
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 11.1 percent (8 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter and 13.9 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first nine months of 2008 when compared to the same periods in 2007.
Revenue growth continues to be driven by the key infrastructure offerings. ITS
signings in the third quarter increased 19 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency) year to year. Signings were strong in the key infrastructure
offerings and grew in all geographies and all sectors.
 
Maintenance
revenue increased 6.0 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and 13.5
percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2008, respectively versus the same periods in the prior year. As
expected, revenue growth moderated in the quarter due to the transfer of the
Ricoh Infoprint maintenance contract.
 
Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue increased 14.5 percent (15 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and was up 25.3 percent (23 percent
adjusted for currency) for the first nine months of 2008. BTO signings, which
can vary significantly period-to-period, increased 14 percent (15 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter.
 
Global
Business Services (GBS) revenue increased 6.8 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) and 13.8 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, versus the prior year
periods. Revenue growth in the quarter was impacted by declines in two
countries, Japan and Australia. When combined, these two countries were down 13
percent adjusted for currency while the remainder of GBS was up 8 percent
adjusted for currency. Total signings in GBS increased 1 percent (decreased 3
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2008. Short-term
signings increased 10 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) with increases
in Europe and Asia Pacific partially offset by decreases in the Americas.
Long-term signings decreased 16 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to a strong third quarter of 2007, which increased more than 85
percent versus the prior year.

GTS gross profit increased
15.9 percent in the third quarter and 21.1 percent in the first nine months of
2008 compared to the same periods of 2007, with gross profit margins improving
2.1 points and 2.0 points, respectively, year to year. Segment pre-tax profit
increased 15.6 percent to $1,189 million, with a pre-tax margin of 11.6 percent
in the third quarter of 2008, up 0.8 points versus third-quarter 2007. Pre-tax
profit in the first nine months of 2008 increased 27.0 percent to $3,171
million, with a pre-tax margin of 10.3 percent, an improvement of 1.2 points
year to year. The margin expansion was driven primarily by an improved cost
structure, a mix to higher value offerings in ITS and year-to-year savings in
retirement-related costs.
 
GBS
gross profit increased 27.7 percent in the third quarter and 25.4 percent for
the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007, with gross
profit margins improving 4.5 points and 2.4 points, respectively, year to year.
Segment pre-tax profit increased 38.9 percent to $724 million, with a pre-tax
margin of 14.0 percent in the third quarter of 2008, an expansion of 3.3 points
year to year. Approximately 2 points of the margin improvement was driven by
better resource utilization, pricing and cost and expense management with the
remainder attributable to lower retirement-related costs. Pre-tax profit in the
first nine months of 2008 increased 31.4 percent to $1,940 million, with a
pre-tax margin of 12.4 percent, an increase of 1.8 points versus the first nine
months of 2007.

Global Services signings are
managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a
Global Services contract. Signings are used by management to assess period
performance of Global Services management. There are no third-party standards
or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by
management includes an approximation of currency and involves estimates and
judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and
duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down
costs. For example, for long-term contracts that require significant up-front
investment by the company, the portions of these contracts that are a signing are
those periods in which there is a significant economic impact on the client if
the commitment is not achieved, usually through a termination charge or the
client incurring significant wind-down costs as a result of the termination.
For short-term contracts that do not require significant upfront investments, a
signing is usually equal to the full contract value. Long-term contracts
represent SO and BTO contracts as well as GBS contracts with the U.S. Federal
government and its agencies and Application Management Services (AMS) for
custom and legacy applications. Short-term contracts represent the remaining
GBS offerings of Consulting and Systems Integration, AMS for packaged
applications and ITS contracts.
 
Signings include SO, BTO,
ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated
as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes SO, BTO,
ITS, GBS and Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work
under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations,
changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue
not materialized and currency assumptions used to approximate constant
currency.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       Systems and Technology
revenue decreased 9.5 percent (down 11 percent adjusted for currency) and
declined 4.5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively, versus the same periods in
2007. On June 1, 2007, the company completed the divestiture of its
printing business. Systems and Technology revenue, excluding the divested
printing business, decreased 1.9 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) for
the first nine months of 2008 versus the comparable period in 2007. See Note 9
on page 16 for additional information regarding this divestiture.  Total Systems revenue decreased 6.5 percent
(8 percent adjusted for currency) and increased 1.9 percent (down 3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008,
respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
 
       System z revenue increased
25.1 percent and 23.4 percent (22 percent and 17 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively. In the
third quarter, System z had double digit revenue growth across all geographies,
with clients in emerging markets also leveraging this platforms stability and
efficiency. MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments increased
49 percent and 33 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of
2008 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively, reflecting
strength in both traditional and specialty workloads. Specialty MIPS increased
over 120 percent in the third quarter as clients exploit the capabilities of
System z to bring new Linux and Java applications to this highly efficient and
cost effective platform. System z
continues to perform well, even in a tough environment, due to its ability
to consolidate the workloads done by many different servers onto a single,
virtualized platform.
 
      
Converged System p revenue increased 7.4 percent and
12.8 percent (6 percent and 9 percent adjusted for currency) in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 versus the third quarter and
first nine months of 2007, respectively, reflecting solid demand for the
companys virtualization and energy-saving capabilities. The revenue growth was
primarily driven by midrange servers which increased 21 percent and 47 percent
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 versus the same periods in
2007 and high-end servers which increased 19 percent in the third quarter and
were essentially flat in the first nine months of 2008 versus the third quarter
and first nine months of 2007, respectively.
 
       Legacy System i revenue decreased
81.9 percent and 51.2 percent (82 percent and 54 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008
versus the same periods in 2007, respectively, as the company transitions the
System i customer base to the converged POWER platform within System p.
 
       System x revenue decreased
20.4 percent and 10.3 percent (22 percent and 15 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively,
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2007. System x server revenue
declined 18 percent and 8 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of
2008 versus the comparable periods of 2007, respectively. Blades revenue
decreased 8 percent and increased 8 percent in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2008 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2007,
respectively. The third quarter declines were primarily driven by sales
execution issues, a competitive pricing environment and a continuation of the
slowdown in the x86 market.
 
       Storage revenue decreased
3.4 percent and increased 5.8 percent (down 5 percent and up 1
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2008 versus the comparable periods in 2007. Total disk revenue increased 1
percent and 9 percent in the third quarter of 2008 and the first nine months of
2008 versus the third quarter and first nine

months
of 2007, respectively. These increases were driven by growth in Enterprise Disk
(1 percent and 11 percent for the periods) on continued strong demand for the
DS8000 product, driven by the strong System z performance. Tape revenue
declined 11 percent in the third quarter of 2008 and was essentially flat for
the first nine months of 2008 versus the comparable periods of 2007,
respectively. The decline in the third quarter was due primarily to clients
deciding to purchase additional media to expand the utilization of their
existing devices rather than commit to new capital purchases.
 
Microelectronics
OEM revenue decreased 26.8 percent and 22.0 percent (27 percent and 22 percent
adjusted for currency), for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively,
versus the comparable periods of 2007. The primary mission of this
business is to provide leadership technology for the systems business, as
demonstrated during the first nine months of 2008 in the new z10 mainframe and POWER6
systems.

percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2008 versus the same periods in 2007, respectively. The decline in the third
quarter was primarily driven by a very strong compare to the third quarter of

      The decreases in gross profit for
the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 versus the same periods of 2007
were primarily due to the decreases in revenue in System x, legacy System i and
Microelectronics OEM.
 
       Overall,
gross margin in the third quarter decreased by 2.4 points versus the prior
year.  This decrease was driven by margin
declines in System x, System z and Microelectronics which impacted the overall
margin by 3.0 points, 1.7 points and 1.6 points, respectively.  Offsetting these margin declines was a
revenue mix benefit of 2.9 points due to a shift in revenue towards System z
and margin improvement in converged System p which impacted the overall margin
by 0.6 points.   For the first nine
months of 2008, gross margin increased 0.4 points compared to the first nine
months of 2007. This increase was driven by a revenue mix benefit of 3.0 points
towards System z and margin improvement in converged System p and Storage which
impacted overall margins by 0.8 points and 0.2 points. Offsetting this were
margin declines in System z, Microelectronics and System x which impacted overall
margins by 1.7 points, 1.2 points and 1.0 points, respectively.
 
       Systems and Technologys pre-tax income
decreased 21.7 percent in the third quarter, and increased 5.0 percent for the
first nine months when compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin decreased 1.0
points in the third quarter and increased 0.5 points for the first nine months,
respectively, versus the prior year periods.

Geographic revenue increased 6.0 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) to $24,628 million in the third quarter of 2008 when compared to the
third quarter of 2007. Adjusted for currency, growth was led by Europe which
increased 4 percent, while Americas was up 2 percent and Asia Pacific was up 1
percent.  Revenue from the companys
growth markets organization increased 12.7 percent (10 percent adjusted for
currency) while growth in the more established major markets slowed to 5
percent (1 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Americas
revenue increased 2.9 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter. Canada increased 5.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency), Latin
America increased 20.7 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) while
U.S.  growth slowed to 1.1 percent.
 
Europe/Middle
East/Africa (EMEA) revenue increased 10.1 percent (4 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter of 2008 when compared to the third quarter of
2007.  In the major countries, Germany
revenue increased 11.8 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), France
increased 10.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), Italy increased 11.6
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), Spain increased 18.1 percent (8
percent adjusted for currency) while the U.K. decreased 3.6 percent as reported
(increased 3 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Asia
Pacific revenue increased 5.8 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter of 2008 versus the prior year third quarter. Adjusted for
currency, growth was led by the India, Australia/New Zealand, South Korea and
ASEAN regions. Japan increased 3.6 percent as reported, but decreased 5 percent
adjusted for currency.
 
Across
the geographies, aggregate revenue from the countries comprising the companys
growth markets organization increased 12.7 percent (10 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter of 2008 and represented approximately 19 percent
of the companys geographic revenue. The company has been investing heavily in
these emerging markets to capture the opportunities to build out public and
private infrastructures. The BRIC countries, a subset of the growth markets,
together grew 18.7 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency), led by double-digit
growth in India of 23.7 percent (33 percent adjusted for currency), Brazil 27.9
percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) and Russia 51.4 percent (51 percent
adjusted for currency). China revenue increased 2.9 percent as reported but
decreased 4 percent adjusted for currency due primarily to greater than
anticipated delays in IT spending, attributed to the countrys focus on the
Summer Olympics. The company believes the fundamental growth opportunity in
China continues to be compelling and continues to invest in capabilities to
capture the growth.
 
In
the third quarter, within total geographic revenue, there were several industry
sectors which significantly impacted the companys overall revenue results.
Public sector revenue increased 8.6 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency)
driven primarily by government and healthcare industries. Within the government
business, the U.S. increased 7.5 percent, and in the growth markets, revenue
grew 39.0 percent (33 percent adjusted for currency) as governments in these
markets are utilizing technology as a key enabler for national development. The
Industrial sector lagged overall performance, increasing 1.7 percent (down 2
percent adjusted for currency) as concerns with the credit markets and margin
pressures impacted short-term spending decisions.

Expense
 
       The company continued to execute its
investment strategy in the third quarter of 2008, aligning investments to
growth opportunities on a global basis. The company also continues to focus on
productivity improvements in its more established markets. The total expense
and other income to revenue ratio was 27.9 percent and 28.5 percent for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2008 versus 27.7 percent and 28.3
percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively.
Total expense and other income increased 5.8 percent and 10.4 percent in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively. Overall, these
increases were primarily driven by approximately 4 points and 6 points due to
the effects of currency and approximately 5 points due to acquisitions for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2008 versus the comparable periods in
2007, respectively.  Operational expense
for the third quarter of 2008 improved by 4 points versus the third quarter of
2007, and by 1 point for the first nine months of 2008, when compared to the
first nine months of 2007.

       Total Selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expense increased 6.0 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) and 9.4 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency),
respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 versus the
same periods in 2007.  The increases in
SG&A were primarily due to the effects of currency (3 points in the third
quarter and 5 points in the first nine months of 2008) and acquisition related
spending, predominantly for Cognos and Telelogic, which accounted for
approximately 5 points of the increase for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2008, respectively. In addition, bad debt expense increased in both
the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 driven by additional specific
accounts receivable reserves reflecting the current economic environment in
many industries. This increased the companys accounts receivable provision
coverage to 2.0 percent, an increase of 50 basis points from the third quarter
of 2007 and 30 basis points from June 30, 2008. These increases were
partially offset by lower retirement-related expense in the third quarter ($61
million) and first nine months of 2008 ($170 million). See Note 5 on pages 11
to 13 and the caption Retirement-Related Benefits on page 42 for

       Other (income) and expense
was income of $51 million and $95 million in the third quarter of
2008 and 2007, and income of $201 million and $528 million for the first nine
months of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in income in the third
quarter was primarily driven by increased losses ($112 million) on derivative
instruments which hedge other foreign currency risks associated with
recorded financial assets and liabilities. The company also hedges its major
cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility in its
global cash planning, which also reduces volatility in the year-over-year
results. The impact of these hedging programs is primarily reflected in Other
(income) and expense, as well as cost of goods sold. The impact of losses from
these cash flow hedges reflected in Other (income) and expense was $46 million,
a decrease of $1 million year to year in the third quarter of 2008. The
decrease in interest income in the third quarter was primarily driven by
declining interest rates.
 
       
The decrease in income for the first nine months of 2008 was primarily
driven by foreign currency transaction losses of $133 million, lower interest
income of $103 million primarily driven by lower interest rates and increased
losses on derivative instruments of $137 million. The impact of losses from the major cross-border
cash flow hedges reflected in Other (income) and expense was $277 million, an
increase of $168 million year to year in the first nine months of 2008.
 
        In addition, net gains
from securities and investments primarily reflect sales of Lenovo stock in the
third quarter of 2008, and the first nine months of 2008 and 2007. As a result
of the sales of shares, the companys ownership in Lenovo declined to voting
ownership of 4.7 percent at September 30, 2008.

The increase
for the third quarter of 2008 was due to increased spending in Software
($87 million) primarily due to acquisitions. This increase was partially
offset by lower spending in Systems and Technology ($6 million) and other unit
spending ($25 million). The increase for the first nine months of 2008 was due
to increased spending in Software ($245 million) primarily due to acquisitions
and other unit spending ($38 million). This increase was partially offset by
lower spending in Systems and Technology ($42 million).

The decrease
in interest expense in the third quarter of 2008 versus the third quarter of
2007 was primarily due to lower interest rates.
 
The increase in interest
expense for the first nine months of 2008 versus the same period of 2007 was
primarily due to the increase in debt associated with the financing of the ASR
agreements in 2007, partially offset by lower interest rates. See Note 7 on page 14

The company had income of $103 million and incurred costs of
$332 million associated with its defined benefit pension plans for the
third quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The comparable amounts for the
first nine months of 2008 and 2007 was income of $308 million and costs of
$967 million, respectively. The decrease in cost was primarily
driven by benefit accruals no longer being recorded for the IBM Personal
Pension Plan, effective January 1, 2008, as well as by lower cost due to
amortization of prior years actual return on assets exceeding expected return
on assets and lower cost due to recognized actuarial losses. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in the cost of defined contribution
plans of $166 million and $583 million in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2008 versus the same periods of 2007. These increases in cost were primarily driven by pension redesign
efforts, primarily in the IBM 401(k) Plus Plan in the U.S., effective January 1,
2008. See Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, in the companys 2007 Annual
Report for additional information on these plan changes. The third
quarter 2008 year-to-year decrease in total retirement-related cost impacted
gross profit, SG&A expense, RD&E expense and Other (income) and expense
by approximately $182 million, $61 million, 
$25 million and $4 million, respectively . The first nine months
decrease in total retirement-related cost impacted gross profit, SG&A
expense, RD&E expense and Other (income) and expense by approximately
$464 million, $170 million, $70 million and $4 million,
respectively.

Taxes
 
       The effective tax
rate for the third quarter of 2008 was 27.5 percent compared with an effective
tax rate of 28.0 percent for the third quarter of 2007. The corresponding
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2008 was 27.5 percent versus
28.2 percent for the first nine months of 2007. The decline in the respective
tax rates was due to a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions,
increased tax incentives and foreign tax credits associated with the foreign
dividend repatriation, offset by a reduction in the U.S. research tax credit
which expired in December 2007 and the absence of the gain associated with
the sale of the printing business in 2007.
 
       During the second quarter of 2008, the
company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding
claims for certain tax incentives.  The
resolution of this matter resulted in a net reduction of the second quarter provision
for income taxes of $281 million. Also during the second quarter, the company
completed its analysis with respect to certain issues associated with recently
issued U.S. tax regulations.  The review
resulted in a reduction of the second quarter provision for income taxes of
$200 million. The above benefits were predominately offset by a one-time tax
cost associated with the intercompany transfer of certain intellectual
property.
 
       The amount of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2007 determined in accordance with FASB Interpretation  No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, increased by
$299 million in the first nine months to $3,393 million. The amount of
unrecognized tax benefits increased by $84 million during the third quarter of
2008. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate is $2,675 million at September 30, 2008.
 
       With limited exception, the company is
no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax
audits by taxing authorities for years through 2001. The years subsequent to
2001 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of
applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing
of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is
always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and
interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for
these years.
 
       The IRS commenced the audit of the
companys U.S. tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in the first quarter of 2007. The
company anticipates that the IRS will complete its field examination of the
companys 2004-2005 income tax returns during the fourth quarter of 2008. As
part of this examination, the IRS is reviewing the valuation placed on the
transfer of certain intellectual property rights to a non-U.S. subsidiary.
There may be a wide difference of views between the company and the IRS with
respect to this and other similar transfers. At this time, the company believes
that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any potential
adjustments relating to these transfers. However, the ultimate liability for
these transfers may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent on the
outcome of the review by the IRS, negotiations and administrative proceedings.
 
       The company has certain foreign tax loss
carryforwards that have not been reflected in the gross deferred tax asset
balance. These losses, the potential tax benefit of which is approximately $1.1
billion, have not been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position as the company has not determined if it will claim these losses. The
company is currently evaluating whether to claim these losses and expects to
make a decision within the next nine months.
 
       See the 2007 IBM Annual Report, Note O, Taxes, for additional
information.

outstanding assuming dilution during the third quarter and first nine months of
2008 was 26.7 million and 70.0 million lower than the same periods in
2007 primarily as a result of the companys common share repurchase program.
 
Results

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At September 30, 2008, the companys
balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. Cash on hand was
approximately $10 billion. At the close of the third quarter, the company had
$4.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding, down $1.3 billion from December 31,
2007. The company continues to access the short-term commercial paper market at
sub-LIBOR pricing in its normal tenors. On October 15, 2008, the company
demonstrated substantial access to the term debt market by raising $4 billion in
cash across five, ten and thirty year maturities. In addition, the company
continues to have available a $10 billion global credit facility as back-up
liquidity.

       Working capital decreased $9,432 million
compared to the year-end 2007 position primarily as a result of a decrease in
current assets. The key drivers are described below:
 
       Current assets decreased $8,990 million,
including a negative currency effect of $968 million, due to:
 
·                  A
decrease of $6,391 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities (see Cash Flow analysis on pages 46 and 47); and
 
·                  A
decline of $3,849 million in short-term receivables driven by:
 
·                  a
decrease of $3,136 million due to collections of higher year-end balances; and
 
·                  approximately
$714 million negative currency effect.
 
·                  An
increase of $823 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily
resulting from:
 
·                  an
increase of $348 million in derivative assets primarily due to changes in
foreign currency rates;
 
·                  an
increase of $339 million primarily related to the pending ILOG acquisition;
 
·                  an
increase of $147 million in prepaid software for services contracts; partially
offset by
 
·                  approximately
$127 million  negative currency effect.
 
·                  Growth
of $337 million in inventory primarily driven by hardware sales performance at
the end of the third quarter for Systems and Technology products.
 
·                  An
increase of $90 million in deferred taxes primarily due to an increase in tax
deductions expected to be realized within the next 12 months.
 
      Current liabilities increased $441
million, including a $656 million negative effect from currency, as a result
of:
 
·                  An
increase in short-term debt of $3,946 million primarily driven by;
 
·                  Reclasses
of $8,405 million from long-term to short-term debt to reflect maturity dates;
and
 
·                  $999
million in new debt issuances; partially offset by
 
·                  $3,941
million in payments and a $1,289 million reduction in commercial paper.
 
·                  A
decrease in accounts payable of $1,285 million (including a negative currency
effect of $150 million) and a decrease of $219 million (including a negative
currency effect of $99 million) in compensation and benefits reflecting
declines from typically higher year-end balances;

Table
of Contents
 
·                  A
decrease of $1,176 million in taxes payable primarily due to income tax
payments in the first nine months of 2008;
 
·                  A
decrease of $577 million (including $103 million of negative currency effect)
in other accrued expenses and liabilities primarily driven by;
 
·                  $190

·                  $95
million decrease in accrued cost for services contracts.
 
·                  A
decrease in deferred income of $247 million, which was primarily driven by
negative effects of currency.

retirement-related plan funding of $458 million ($425 million in 2008 for
non-U.S. plans versus $883 million in 2007: $500 million in the U.S. for
retiree medical and $383 million funding for non-U.S. plans);

increase in cash provided by accounts receivable of $460 million driven by
improved collections;

Debt
 
      The companys funding requirements are
continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset
and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient
flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.

       Global Financing provides funding
predominantly for the companys external client assets as well as for assets
under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services,
generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing
asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 56.
 
       Non-global financing debt decreased $851
million and the debt-to-capitalization ratio decreased to 29.1 percent from
30.0 percent at December 31, 2007. The companys long-term
debt-to-capitalization ratio objective is 20 to 30 percent. This ratio can vary
from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt
positions.
 
       As previously discussed, on October 15,
2008, the company issued $4.0 billion of bonds with $1.4 billion with five-year
maturities, $1.6 billion with 10 year maturities and $1.0 billion with 30 year
maturities. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
 
Equity
 
       Stockholders equity decreased $951
million primarily as a result of a decrease related to net stock transactions
of $5,940 million, driven by the companys common stock repurchases which
resulted in an increase in treasury stock at September 30, 2008, and a
$970 million decrease in accumulated gains and losses not affecting retained
earnings primarily driven by a decrease in foreign currency translation
adjustments. These decreases were partially offset by a $5,959 million increase
in retained earnings driven by net income ($7,907 million), partially offset by
dividend payments ($1,916 million).
 
Looking Forward
 
      The following key drivers impacting IBMs business are described in
more detail in the 2007 IBM Annual Report on page 22.
 
·        Economic environment and corporate spending
budgets
·        Internal business transformation and global
integration initiatives
·        Innovation initiatives
·        Open standards
·        Investing in growth opportunities
 
      The company has a significant global
presence, operating in 170 countries, with approximately 63 percent of its 2007
revenue and 65 percent of its revenue for the first nine months of 2008
generated outside the U.S. In addition, approximately 70 percent of the companys
employees are located outside the United States, including about 37 percent in
Asia Pacific. This global reach gives the company access to markets, with
well-established organizations and management systems who understand the
clients and their challenges and who can respond to these opportunities with
value-add solutions. The companys transformation to a globally integrated
enterprise provides the capabilities to service clients globally and deliver
the best skills and cost from
anywhere in the world.

       In May 2007, the company
met with investors and analysts and discussed a road map to deliver earnings
per share in 2010 in the range of $10 to $11 per share, or 14 to 16 percent
compound growth rate from 2006. The companys 2010 roadmap is to generate
earnings per share growth in the range of $9 to $10 per share, or 10 to 14
percent compound growth from 2006 through a combination of revenue growth,
margin improvement, growth initiatives, acquisitions and effective capital
deployment to fund growth and provide returns to stockholders through dividends
and common stock repurchases. In addition to these elements, the companys
roadmap to the $10 to $11 per share range includes the projected benefit of
retirement-related costs based on December 31, 2006 assumptions. Actual
retirement-related costs will depend on several factors including financial
market performance, the interest rate environment and actuarial assumptions. In
March 2008, the company met again with investors and analysts and
discussed the progress the company is making on its 2010 roadmap.
 
       The companys performance in
the first nine months of 2008 highlighted the benefits of its global reach and
the strength of its business model. The financial results reflected solid
progress on major elements of the long-term goals; however, the company
measures the success of its business model over the long term, not any
individual quarter or year. Earnings per share growth is dependent on a number
of factors and may not be consistent throughout the periods. The companys
strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective of
optimizing long-term performance.
 
       In the emerging growth markets,
the company will continue to invest for revenue growth and leadership. The
company is focused on identifying growth opportunities and following a
disciplined investment policy to capitalize on these opportunities. Through its
investments, the company has developed extensive capabilities in emerging
countries to capture these growth opportunities. In 2008, the company
implemented a new organization and management structure that has increased its
focus on these growth markets. The company expects these rapidly growing
markets to drive revenue and profit growth in future periods. In the more
established markets, the company will continue to drive productivity. The
company will also continue its focus on internal business transformation and
global integration activities. The company has made significant progress in its
initiatives, but, there is additional opportunity going-forward to improve the
companys balance point. On-going initiatives in these areas have contributed
to both gross margin improvement and operational expense improvement and are
expected to provide additional productivity improvements going-forward.  Key focus areas include Global Technology
Services service delivery, Integrated Supply Chain and integrated Global
Support functions.
 
       The company is a proven infrastructure
provider of IT technology. The companys broad product and services portfolio delivers
value to clients  through a combination of services, hardware and software.
The portfolio is focused on high-value solutions that can deliver measurable
benefit to clients with offerings that can address a wide scope of client
issues including: energy savings, security and resiliency, risk management and
cost reduction among many others.
 
       The company remains committed
to technology leadership and will continue to focus internal investments, complemented
with strategic acquisitions, on high-value, high-growth opportunities. In July,
the company announced that it plans to invest $1.5 billion to promote
nanotechnology research and advanced semiconductor technology. In October, the
company announced that it will open a new research facility in Shanghai, China
that will focus on next-generation Internet applications and solutions for
small and medium businesses.
 
       The continued investments in
the Software segment have led to this business emergence as a strong source of
revenue growth and the largest contributor to the companys profit in 2007 and
the first nine months of 2008. The Software business is differentiated in the
industry by both the strength of its individual products and the breadth of the
software offerings. The key to continued Software growth stems from the ability
to maintain and grow this industry-leading software business, and by continuing
to capitalize on industry trends such as SOA and Information on Demand. The
company expects to accomplish this through a combination of internal
development and strategic acquisitions. 
In July, the company announced an agreement to acquire ILOG, which will
increase the companys software capabilities. These products will be rapidly
developed and integrated to bring continued value to clients.
 
       Within the Global Services
business, revenue, profit growth and margin has improved and the company
continues to see significant results from the targeted actions and investments
it has made the last few years. The Global Services business enters the fourth
quarter with strong executional momentum and with a signings backlog of $114
billion. The portfolio is strong with a complement of offerings and
capabilities that deliver both high value and productivity to clients. The
overall Global Services business is well positioned going forward to take
advantage of profitable opportunities in the marketplace.
 
       In the Systems and Technology
business, the company will focus its investments on differentiating
technologies with high-growth potential including POWER6, BladeCenter-S,
high-performance computing, virtualization and energy efficiency. The
transition to POWER6 technology was completed in the first half of 2008. The April product
announcements in converged System p have provided momentum for this brand
going-forward. Within Storage, the company has started to
 
49





Table of Contents
 
integrate the recently acquired (December 2007) XIV technologies into
its portfolio. In October, the company announced a new entry-level System z10
business class mainframe targeted at midsize companies and clients in emerging
markets focused on application development, server consolidation and a platform
which can serve as the foundation of new enterprise data centers. The company
also announced new Storage disk and tape products to work with the new
mainframe.
 
              The company expects
2008 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $1.5 billion, a
decrease of approximately $1.1 billion compared to 2007. This estimate reflects
current pension plan assumptions, the impacts of pension plan redesign efforts
and the fourth quarter termination of the Japan Career Choice Retirement Plan
that will result in a one-time benefit of approximately $100 million. Through September 30,
2008, the year-to-date actual return on assets for the IBM Personal Pension
Plan was (10.1) percent and for the companys material non-U.S. defined benefit
plans, the return on assets ranged from (12.0) to (19.0) percent. Consistent
with accounting requirements, the company will remeasure its defined benefit
pension plans at December 31, 2008. If pension plan returns on assets
continue at the September 30, 2008 level, the company would experience a
non-cash impact to its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and
Stockholders Equity. See the companys 2007 Annual Report Note U, Retirement-Related
Benefits, on page 105 for additional information.
 
       The company expects that its
effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 27.5 percent. This rate is
lower than the 2007 tax rate of 28.1 percent due to an expectation of a more
favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, increased tax incentives
and foreign tax credits associated with foreign dividend repatriation, offset
by a reduction in tax credits. The rate may change period to period based on
non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits, as well as
recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, the
timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and
the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
       In 2007 and 2006, the companys
cash tax rate was approximately 18 percent and 16 percent, respectively.
 
       The companys cash tax rate
represents the amount of income taxes paid during the year over Income from
continuing operations before income taxes. The cash tax rate differs from the
companys effective tax rate due to a number of variables including, but not
limited to, certain items of income and expense that are recognized in
different years for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes,
differences in currency rates used in the translation of the non-U.S. income
tax provision and income tax payments and current year cash tax payments or
refunds that are related to prior years. The company anticipates that its cash
tax rate may decrease for the current year as a result of additional tax
credits.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes
in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the
companys results. At September 30, 2008, currency changes resulted in
assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into
fewer U.S. dollars than at year-end 2007. The company uses a variety of
financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to
financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions. Further
discussion of currency and hedging appears in the 2007 IBM Annual Report in
Note K, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on pages 88 to 91.
 
       In the
first nine months of 2008, the companys revenue increased 9.6 percent as
reported and 3.7 percent adjusted for currency. In the third quarter, revenue
increased 4.9 percent as reported and 1.7 percent adjusted for currency. This
currency benefit, which narrowed in the quarter, was driven from the companys
operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The companys expectation
is that currency changes may have a negative impact on year-to-year revenue
growth in the fourth quarter of 2008. The company maintains currency hedging
programs for cash planning purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the
volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results. In addition
to the translation of earnings, the impact of currency changes also may affect
the companys pricing and sourcing actions. For example, the company may
procure components and supplies in multiple functional currencies and sell
products and services in other currencies. Since the company operates in a very
competitive environment, it believes that some of this currency-based cost
advantage is passed on to the client in reduced price. Therefore, it is
impractical to precisely quantify the impact of currency on these transactions
and on consolidated net income. However, the company estimates that the maximum
effect of currency, before taking pricing or sourcing actions into account, and
net of hedging activity, contributed approximately no more than 20 percent of
total earnings per share growth in the third-quarter 2008. This hypothetical
upper limit assumes that no currency benefit was passed through to clients in
pricing actions or mitigated through sourcing actions.
 
       For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches
that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly
inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations,
as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Generally, the
company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts
to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into foreign currency hedge
contracts.

Table of Contents
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
       In the
companys 2007 IBM Annual Report, on pages 44 to 46, there is a discussion
of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of
data. The table presented on page 44 includes net cash from operating
activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global
credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the nine months ended or
as of, as applicable, September 30, 2008, those amounts are $12.2 billion
for net cash from operating activities, $9.8 billion of cash and marketable
securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
      The major rating agencies
ratings on the companys debt securities at September 30, 2008 appear in
the table below and remain unchanged from December 31, 2007. The company
has no contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit
rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or
liquidity.

       The table
appearing on page 45 of the 2007 IBM Annual Report presents the format in
which management reviews cash flows for each of the past five years and is
accompanied by a description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and
reviewed. While the company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, on page 7
of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events underlying sources and
uses of cash in that format on pages 46 and 47, the following is the
management view of cash flows for the first nine months of 2008 and 2007
prepared in a manner consistent with the table on page 45 of the 2007 IBM Annual
Report:

       Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2008
increased $1,274 million versus the first nine months of 2007. The improvement
year to year was driven by the increase in net income and lower
retirement-related plan funding, partially offset by an increase in inventory.
There were several significant uses of cash in the first nine months of 2008
including the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions and capital investments. Also,
in the first nine months of 2008, $11.8 billion was returned to stockholders
through dividends and share repurchases.
 
       In
February, the companys Board of Directors authorized $15 billion in additional
funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase program. At September 30,
2008, the company had approximately $6.3 billion of share repurchase
authorization remaining.
 
       At December 31,
2007, the company had liabilities of $937 million, representing the fair value of
derivative investments in qualifying net investment hedge relationships. During
the first nine months of 2008, the company took actions to reduce hedge levels
in some currencies. See the 2007 Annual Report, Note K, Derivatives and
Hedging Transactions, for additional information. In the first nine months of
2008, the company had a use of cash in investing activities of $338 million related
to these instruments. The company will reflect a use of cash in investing
activities of $546 million for 2008 and
 
51





Table of Contents
 
estimates a use of cash of $481 million in 2009,
related to these liabilities.
 
       Events
that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above
include significant changes in operating results, material changes in
geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or
periods of severe and prolonged downturn in the capital markets. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in Note 14 on pages 19 to 22 of this Form 10-Q.
With respect to pension funding, the company is not quantifying any future
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets.
 
Global Financing
 
       Global Financing is a reportable segment
within IBM that is measured as if it were a standalone entity. Accordingly, the
information presented in this section is consistent with this separate company
view. The mission of Global Financing is to generate a strong return on equity
and to facilitate clients acquisition of IBM hardware, software and services.

       The increase in revenue, in the third
quarter of 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007, was primarily due to:
 
·                  An increase in external revenue of 1.7
percent (1 percent decline adjusted for currency), due to growth in financing
revenue (up 6.1 percent to $484 million), partially offset by a decrease in
used equipment sales (down 10.4 percent to $149 million); and
 
·                  Growth in internal revenue of 31.3 percent
driven by an increase in used equipment sales to the System and Technology
segment to support their external sales (up 58.3 percent to $273 million) and
an increase in internal financing (up 4.6 percent to $183 million).
 
The
increase in external and internal financing revenue was primarily due to higher
average asset balances.
 
The
increase in revenue, in the first nine months of 2008, as compared to the same
period in 2007, was primarily due to:
 
·                  An increase in external revenue of 3.6
percent (2 percent decline adjusted for currency) due to growth in financing
revenue (up 9.6 percent to $1,473 million), offset by a decrease in used
equipment sales (down 12.8 percent to $427 million); and
 
·                  Growth in internal revenue of 31.8 percent
driven by an increase in used equipment sales to the System and Technology
segment to support their external sales (up 51.6 percent to $799 million) and
an increase in internal financing (up 11.4 percent to $568 million).
 
The
increase in external and internal financing revenue was primarily due to higher
average asset balances.
 
Global Financing gross
profit increased 20.0 percent in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the same
period in 2007, with gross margin increasing 3.6 points.  Gross profit increased 18.6 percent in the
first nine months of 2008 compared to the prior year, with gross margin
increasing 2.3 points. The improvement in both periods was primarily due to an
improvement in equipment sales margins.
 
52





Table of Contents
 
Global Financing pre-tax
income increased 3.2 percent in the third quarter of 2008 versus the third
quarter of 2007, primarily driven by the increase in gross profit of $102
million, offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable provisions of
$86 million and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense of
$10 million. Pre-tax income increased 11.6 percent in the first nine months of
2008 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in gross
profit of $290 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable
provisions of $126 million and an increase in selling, general and
administrative expense of $40 million.
 
       The increase in return on equity from
third quarter 2008 to the same period in 2007 and for the first nine months of
2008 compared to the first nine months of 2007 was primarily due to higher
after-tax income.

(d) Global Financing
debt is comprised of intercompany loans and external debt. A portion of Global
Financing debt is in support of the companys internal business, or related to
intercompany mark-up embedded in the Global Financing assets.  See table on page 56.
 
Sources
and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in
Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets. Client
financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware,
software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment,
software and services to meet IBM clients total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for equipment as well as loans for
hardware, software and services with terms generally for two to seven years.
Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services and are
unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis in order to
mitigate the associated risk. Loan agreements include credit protective
language and dollar limits on how much can be financed in order to minimize
credit risk. Client financing also includes internal activity as described on page 51
of the 2007 IBM Annual Report.
 
       Commercial financing
receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing
for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts receivable financing

generally
range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term receivables are primarily unsecured
and are also subject to additional credit actions in order to mitigate the
associated risk.
 
       Within Global Financings total
financing assets, excluding internal assets, approximately 97 percent of the
portfolio is in the segments core competency of technology financing. At September 30,
2008, approximately 60 percent of the external portfolio is with investment
grade clients, with no exposure to consumers or mortgage-lending institutions.

       Cash collections of both client and
commercial financing assets exceeded new financing originations in the third
quarter, as well as the first nine months of 2008, which resulted in a net
decline in financing assets from June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively. The increase in originations in both periods was due to improving
volumes in both client and commercial financing.
 
       Cash generated by Global
Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and dividends
to IBM.

recoveries, which were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents translation adjustments.
 
       The percentage of financing
receivables reserved increased from 1.3 percent at December 31, 2007 to
1.8 percent at September 30, 2008 due to the increase in the specific allowance
for doubtful accounts.  Specific reserves
increased 36.5 percent from December 31, 2007 to September 30, 2008 due to
current economic conditions.  Unallocated
reserves decreased $11 million in the same period due to the decline in gross
financing receivables.

Table of Contents
 
       Global Financings bad debt expense was
$119 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, compared
with a reduction of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2007. The increase was primarily attributed to the increase in specific
reserves.
 
       In the third quarter of 2008, compared
to the third quarter of 2007, bad debt expense increased $86 million.
 
Residual Value
 
       Residual value is a risk unique to the
financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to
accurately project future equipment values at lease inception.  Global Financing has insight into product
plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
       Global Financing optimizes the
recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment
returned at the end of a lease, represented 38.8 percent and 37.5 percent of
Global Financings revenue in the third quarter and first nine months,
respectively, of 2008 and 34.9 percent and 35.4 percent in the third quarter
and first nine months, respectively, of 2007. The increase in the third quarter
of 2008 and the first nine months of 2008 was driven primarily by the increase
in internal used sales to the Systems and Technology segment. The gross margins
on these sales were 48.1 percent and 39.4 percent in the third quarter of 2008
and 2007, respectively. The increase is driven by a shift in mix towards
internal sales of higher margin products as well as higher margins on overall
used equipment sales.  The gross margins
were 47.9 percent and 42.0 percent for the first nine months of 2008 and 2007,
respectively. This increase is primarily driven by a shift in mix towards the
higher margin internal sales and higher margins on internal used equipment
sales.
 
       The following table presents the
recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and direct
financing leases and operating leases at December 31, 2007 and September 30,
2008. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30, 2008 is
expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that
are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease
or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees
were $279 million and $156 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2008 and September 30,
2007, respectively, and $757 million and $473 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively.
The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease
were $9 million and $8 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2008 and September 30,
2007, respectively, and $39 million and $22 million for the financing
transactions originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2008
and September 30, 2007, respectively. The cost of guarantees was
$0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and
$0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, and
$4.9 million and $2.9 million for each of the nine months ended September 30,
2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively.

       The company funds Global Financing
through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans
and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company
to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing
receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 53.
 
       The Global Financing business provides
funding predominantly for the companys external clients but also provides
intercompany financing for the company. As previously stated, the company measures Global
Financing as if it were a standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense
relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal
business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 52
and in Segment Information on pages 65 and 66.
 
       In the companys Consolidated Statement
of Earnings on pages 3 and 4, however, the interest expense supporting
Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost
of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides
additional information on debt. In this table, Intercompany activity is
comprised of internal loans and leases at arms-length pricing in support of
Global Services long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company
believes these assets should be appropriately levered in line with the overall
Global Financing business model.

Looking Forward
 
Global Financings financial position provides
flexibility and funding capacity which enable the company to be well positioned
in the current environment. Global Financings assets and new financing volumes
are primarily IBM products and services financed to the companys clients and
business partners and substantially all financing assets are IT related assets
which provide a stable base of business for future growth.
 
The companys System z and high-end converged System p
servers announced this year are a significant financing opportunity. Global
Financings offerings are competitive and available to clients as a result of
the companys borrowing cost and access to the capital markets. Overall, Global
Financings originations will be dependent upon the demand for IT products and
services as well as client participation rates.
 
Although funding costs have risen, IBM has continued
to access both the short-term commercial paper market and the medium and
long-term debt markets. A protracted period where IBM could not access the
capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in originations.
 
Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The companys interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing funding strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies in
both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 55, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the companys product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each
of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with product
and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business
going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the economy.
