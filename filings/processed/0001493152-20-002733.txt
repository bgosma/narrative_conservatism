NOTE
1: NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
Organization
and Nature of Business
 
mPhase
Technologies, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “mPhase,” “XDSL”,
“Company,” “us,” or “we.”
 
The
Company was incorporated in the state of New Jersey in 1979 under the name Tecma Laboratory, Inc. and has subsequently operated
under Tecma Laboratories, Inc., and Lightpaths TP Technologies, Inc., until June 2, 1997 when the Company changed its name to
mPhase Technologies, Inc.
 
On
January 11, 2019, the Company underwent a major change in management and control. The new management of the Company is positioning
the Company to be a technology leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning while enabling a more rapid commercial development
of its patent portfolio and other intellectual property. The Company’s goal is to generate significant revenue from its
artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.
 
On
February 15, 2019, the Company acquired Travel Buddhi, a software platform to enhance travel via ultra-customization tools that
tailor a planned trip experience in ways not previously available.
 
On
June 30, 2019, the Company acquired 99% of the outstanding common shares of Alpha Predictions LLP (“Alpha Predictions”).
Alpha Predictions is an India-based technology company that has developed a suite of commercial data analysis products for use
across multiple industries. The Company expects the acquisition to result in synergies with its other operating divisions, which
will drive revenue growth and innovation.
 
Basis
of Presentation
 
The
condensed consolidated unaudited financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
items, which in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the dates and periods presented and to make such information not misleading. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) have been omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”); nevertheless, management of the Company believes that the disclosures herein
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
 
The
condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include the operations
of mPhase and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, mPower Technologies, Inc., Medds, Inc., mPhase Technologies India Private Limited
effective March 19, 2019, and Alpha Predictions LLP effective June 30, 2019. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in the consolidation.
 
These
condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2019, contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with
the SEC on October 15, 2019. The results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2019, are not necessarily indicative
of results to be expected for any other interim period or the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.

NOTE
2: GOING CONCERN
 
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
 
The
Company has incurred negative cash flows from operations of $660,849 for the six months ended December 31, 2019. At December 31,
2019, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,546,818, and an accumulated deficit of $229,874,128. It is management’s
opinion that these facts raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of twelve months from the date of this report, without additional debt or equity financing. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts nor to the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
In
order to meet its working capital needs through the next twelve months from the date of this report and to fund the growth of
our nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies, the Company may consider plans to raise additional
funds through the issuance of equity or debt. Although the Company intends to obtain additional financing to meet its cash needs,
the Company may be unable to secure any additional financing on terms that are favorable or acceptable to it, if at all.
 
NOTE
3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Foreign
Currency Translation and Transactions
 
The
functional currency of our operations in India is the Indian Rupee. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense items are translated at the
average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange
rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders’ equity as “Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss).” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income (loss), as other comprehensive income (loss). There have been no significant fluctuations in the exchange
rate for the conversion of Indian Rupee to U.S. dollars after the balance sheet date.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. If actual results significantly differ from the Company’s estimates,
the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. Significant estimates include
the collectability of accounts receivable, valuation of intangible assets, accrued expenses, valuation of derivative liabilities,
stock-based compensation, and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
 
Concentrations
of Credit Risk
 
Credit
Risk
 
Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with three financial institutions. Deposits held with
the financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on such deposits,
but may be redeemed upon demand. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions.
With respect to accounts receivable, the Company monitors the credit quality of its customers as well as maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
 
Revenue
Risk
 
Agreements
which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of revenue risk consist principally of one customer agreement. For the
six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, this one customer accounted for 99% and 0% of our total revenue, respectively. At
December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, this one customer accounted for 96% and 99% of our total accounts receivable, respectively.
 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
 
For
purposes of balance sheet presentation and reporting of cash flows, the Company considers all unrestricted demand deposits, money
market funds and highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of less than 90 days to be cash and cash equivalents.
There were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019.

NOTE
3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Accounts
Receivable
 
The
Company regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts.
In evaluating the level of established loss reserves, the Company makes judgments regarding its customers’ ability to make
required payments, economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of these parties change, circumstances develop
or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses and such losses traditionally have been within its expectations. At December 31, 2019 and
June 30, 2019, the Company determined there was no requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
Goodwill
and Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill
is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible
assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances
change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by first comparing
the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value,
a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. On June 30, 2020, we will perform our annual evaluation of
goodwill impairment to determine if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.
 
Patents
and licenses are capitalized when the Company determines there will be a future benefit derived from such assets and are stated
at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally five years.
As of December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, the book value of patents and licenses of $214,383, has been fully amortized and no
amortization expense was recorded for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
Capitalized
Software Development Costs
 
The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 350-40, “Internal Use Software.” ASC 350-40 provides guidance for determining
whether computer software is internal-use software, and on accounting for the proceeds of computer software originally developed
or obtained for internal use and then subsequently sold to the public. It also provides guidance on capitalization of the costs
incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use. The Company expenses all costs incurred during the preliminary
project stage of its development, and capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs incurred
relating to upgrades and enhancements to the software are capitalized if it is determined that these upgrades or enhancements
add additional functionality to the software. Costs incurred to improve and support products after they become available are charged
to expense as incurred.
 
Capitalized
software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, currently three years. Management
evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
 
At
December 31, 2019, the book value of purchased and developed technology of $2,925,827, included two technology platforms, a machine
learning platform and an artificial intelligence platform. For the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, amortization expense
which is included in general and administration expenses within the consolidated statements of operations, was $484,278
and $0, respectively.
 
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 
The
Company accounts for the fair value of financial instruments in accordance with ASC topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures” (ASC 820), formerly SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”. ASC 820 defines “fair value”
as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
 
ASC
820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
 
Level
1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.
 
Level
2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
 
Level
3: Inputs that are generally unobservable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s
best estimate of fair value.
 
Financial
instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, due from affiliates, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, due to related parties, and other current liabilities. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the
accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. The fair value of short and
long-term debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value. It is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or
credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

NOTE
3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Revenue
Recognition
 
Revenue
is derived from the sale of artificial intelligence and machine learning focused technology products. The Company recognizes revenue
when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is
transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in
exchange for transferring products. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies
with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. In the event any discounts, sales
incentives, or similar arrangements are agreed to with a customer, such amounts are estimated at time of sale and deducted from
revenue. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue (see Note 6).
 
Share-Based
Compensation
 
The
Company computes share based payments in accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation (“ASC 718-10”) and Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, Share-Based Payment No. 107 (“SAB 107”). The Company has applied the provisions
of SAB 107 in its adoption of ASC 718-10. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with ASC Topic
505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and warrants by using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
Derivative
Instruments
 
The
Company enters into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or are hybrid instruments that
contain embedded derivative features. The Company accounts for these arrangements in accordance with ASC topic 815, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as well as related interpretations of this standard. In accordance with this
standard, derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and are measured at fair
values with gains or losses recognized in earnings. Embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host
contract are bifurcated and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings.
The Company determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate
valuation models, considering all of the rights and obligations of each instrument.
 
The
Company estimates fair values of derivative financial instruments using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are
considered consistent with the objective measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, the Company considers,
among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies and the expected means of settlement. Estimating
fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and
are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition,
option-based techniques (such as Black-Scholes model) are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price
of the Company’s common stock. Since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair values,
our income (expense) going forward will reflect the volatility in these estimates and assumption changes.
 
Convertible
Debt Instruments
 
The
Company records debt net of debt discount for beneficial conversion features and warrants, on a relative fair value basis. Beneficial
conversion features are recorded pursuant to the Beneficial Conversion and Debt Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ASC. The amounts allocated to warrants and beneficial conversion rights are recorded as debt discount and
as additional paid-in-capital. Debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.

NOTE
3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Income
Taxes
 
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting for Income Taxes, as clarified by ASC 740-10, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the
estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based
on changes to the assets or liabilities from year-to-year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations
of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies.
If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value
of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based
on the “more likely than not” criteria of ASC 740.
 
ASC
740 requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant
tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the “more-likely-than-not”
threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company’s tax returns for its
June 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 tax years may be selected for examination by the taxing authorities as the statute of limitations
remains open.
 
The
Company recognizes expenses for tax penalties and interest assessed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities
upon receiving valid notice of assessments. The Company has received no such notices for the tax years ended June 30, 2019 and
2018.
 
Earnings
Per Share
 
In
accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating
EPS on a diluted basis.
 
In
computing diluted EPS, only potential common shares that are dilutive, those that reduce EPS or increase loss per share, are included.
The effect of contingently issuable shares are not included if the result would be anti-dilutive, such as when a net loss is reported.
Therefore, basic and diluted EPS are computed using the same number of weighted average shares for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as we incurred a net loss for those periods. At December 31, 2019, there were outstanding
warrants to purchase up to approximately 37,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, approximately 703,726 shares
of the Company’s common stock to be issued, and notes payable held by third parties with convertible features that if converted,
would total approximately 1,400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which may dilute future EPS. At December 31, 2018,
there were notes payable held by third parties and officers and directors, with convertible features that if converted, would
total approximately 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which may dilute future EPS.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards
 
Effective
July 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”).
The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases
on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective
transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use
certain transition relief. In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842, which amends certain aspects of the new lease standard.
The Company determined the adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
Effective
July 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-11, Update to Earnings Per Share (Topic
260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial
Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception.
The ASU makes limited changes to the guidance on classifying certain financial instruments as either liabilities or equity. The
ASU is intended to improve (1) the accounting for instruments with “down-round” provisions and (2) the readability
of the guidance in ASC 480 on distinguishing liabilities from equity by replacing the indefinite deferral of certain pending content
with scope exceptions. The Company determined the adoption of ASU 2017-11 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
 
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
 
In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurement, based on the concepts in the Concept Statement, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The standard is
effective for the Company as of July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair
Value Measurement, based on the concepts in the Concept Statement, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The standard
is effective for the Company as of July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTE
4: BUSINESS ACQUISITION
 
On
June 30, 2019, the Company acquired 99% of the outstanding common shares of Alpha Predictions LLP (“Alpha Predictions”).
Alpha Predictions is an India-based technology company that has developed a suite of commercial data analysis products for use
across multiple industries. The Company expects the acquisition to result in synergies with its other operating divisions, which
will drive revenue growth and innovation.
 
The
goodwill of $6,020 arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of the
Company and Alpha Predictions.
 
The
following table summarizes the consideration paid for Alpha Predictions and the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed recognized at the acquisition date.
 

 
The
Company is currently evaluating the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary estimates and
measurements are, therefore, subject to change during the measurement period. The acquired intangible asset – purchased
software was recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. It is provisionally subject to a useful life of 3 years, pending
further evaluation of the underlying software.
 
The
fair value of the one-percent noncontrolling interest in Alpha Predictions was determined to be immaterial, based on extrapolation
of the price paid by the Company for its controlling interest and consideration of any potential control premiums.

NOTE
6: REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
 
The
following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category within our single reporting segment:
 

 
For
the three and six months ended December 31, 2019, the Company was subject to revenue concentration risk as one customer accounted
for 99% of our total revenue for both periods.
 
Subscription
and Application Development and Implementation Revenue
 
The
Company recognizes revenue when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation to a customer. The Company primarily has one performance
obligation, which includes the combined promise to develop, implement, and license customized software. Payment terms for the
software include one-time application development and implementation fees, which are generally billed on a time-and-materials
basis over the development and implementation period, plus fixed license subscription fees, which may either be billed in full
upfront or in monthly installments over the license period, which is generally three years. All of these fees are allocated to
the single performance obligation of providing software to the customer.
 
The
performance obligation is fully satisfied at the point in time when the customer has taken control of the completed software,
which is when physical possession of the software has transferred to the customer, the customer is able to use and benefit from
the software, and the contractual license period has begun. Since the Company has no further obligation to the customer once control
of the software has transferred, the Company recognizes revenue in full for all of the development and implementation fees at
that point in time. Subscription fees are also recognized when control of the software has transferred to the customer but only
to the extent such fees are contractually guaranteed to the Company. Any future monthly subscription fees that the Company would
not have a contractually guaranteed right to collect in the event of early termination of the contract are instead recognized
as revenue on a straight-line basis over the license period.
 
Service
and Support Revenue
 
Certain
contracts also contain a second performance obligation for service and support. This performance obligation includes the promise
to provide future updates, upgrades, and enhancements to the software over the license period, if and when they occur. Service
and support fees are fixed as a percentage of total contract value and billed in monthly installments over the license period.
The Company recognizes service and support fee revenue over time, on a straight-line basis over the license period, as the customer
receives such services on a generally uniform basis throughout the license period.
 
Allocation
of the Transaction Price
 
Prices
allocated to each performance obligation generally correspond with the contractually stated prices, since they equal standalone
selling price. In some cases, services may be discounted, which requires the company to allocate the transaction price based on
relative standalone selling price. The Company estimates standalone selling price based on comparable industry practices and the
costs and margins involved in providing services to its customers.
 
Contract
Liabilities
 
Contract
liabilities include amounts billed to the customer in excess of revenue recognized and are presented as contract liabilities on
the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 contract liabilities totaled $115,166 and
$0, respectively.
 
Practical
Expedient
 
The
Company has elected a practical expedient to omit certain disclosures about the transaction price allocated to remaining performance
obligations for contracts with terms of one year or less.
 
NOTE
7: SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE
 
Short
term notes payable is comprised of the following:
 

 
[1]
effective December 10, 2018, the Company entered into a “Judgment Settlement Agreement” to satisfy in full the
Forbearance Agreement with Fife that was previously in effect. As a result, under the Judgment Settlement Agreement, no shares
of the Company’s common stock are issuable or eligible to be converted into. Under the terms of the Judgment Settlement
Agreement, the Company is required to pay $15,000 per month from January 15, 2019 through and including February 15, 2020, with
a final payment of $195,000 due and payable in March of 2020. The Company has made all payments required as of the date hereof.
Failure to make any of the payments, when due, will result in the remaining liability balance of $559,313 (at December 31, 2019),
to be immediately due and payable by the Company.

NOTE
9: DERIVATIVE LIABILITY
 
The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and
Hedging.” The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value
is recorded in the statement of operation as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the
instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that
are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities
at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.
 
The
following table presents a reconciliation of the derivative liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) from June 30, 2018 to December 31, 2019:

Total
derivative liability at December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 amounted to $586,073 and $133,669, respectively. The change in fair
value included in earnings of $470,400 is due in part to the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock increasing
from $0.85 at June 30, 2019 to $0.91 at December 31, 2019, coupled with slightly increased conversion prices due to the effect
of “ratchet” provisions incorporated within the convertible notes payable.

earned warrants, based upon a value of $0.50 per warrant. At December 31, 2019, there remains no additional stock-based
compensation expense related to the Warrant Agreement that the Company expects to recognize over the next six months.
 
The
Company estimates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black-scholes option valuation model that uses
the assumptions noted in the table below. Because black-scholes option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for
inputs, those ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.
The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model; separate groups
of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term
of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted
are expected to be outstanding; the range given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
the time of grant. The following assumptions were utilized during the six months ended December 31, 2019:

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto,
and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 found in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on October 15, 2019.
 
Overview
 
mPhase
Technologies, Inc., was incorporated in the state of New Jersey in 1979 under the name Tecma Laboratory, Inc. and has subsequently
operated under Tecma Laboratories, Inc., and Lightpaths TP Technologies, Inc., until June 2, 1997 when the Company changed its
name to mPhase Technologies, Inc.
 
On
January 11, 2019, the Company underwent a major change in management and control. The new management of the Company is positioning
the Company to be a technology leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning while enabling a more rapid commercial development
of its patent portfolio and other intellectual property. The Company’s goal is to generate significant revenue from its
artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.
 
On
February 15, 2019, the Company acquired Travel Buddhi, a software platform to enhance travel via ultra-customization tools that
tailor a planned trip experience in ways not previously available.
 
On
June 30, 2019, the Company acquired 99% of the outstanding common shares of Alpha Predictions LLP (“Alpha Predictions”).
Alpha Predictions is an India-based technology company that has developed a suite of commercial data analysis products for use
across multiple industries. The Company expects the acquisition to result in synergies with its other operating divisions, which
will drive revenue growth and innovation.
 
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The
discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial statements requires management to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates past judgments and estimates, including those related to
bad debts, potential impairment of intangible assets, accrued liabilities and contingencies. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies
and related risks described in Note 3 above and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on October
15, 2019 are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates. As of December 31, 2019, there had been no material
changes to any of the critical accounting policies contained therein.

Revenue
 
Our
revenue increased to $7,561,967 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0 for the three months ended December
31, 2018. The increase is the result of expanding upon a new customer agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2019. Such new customer agreement accounted for 99% of our total revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2019,
resulting in a significant risk of customer concentration.

Cost
of Revenue
 
Cost
of revenue totaled $5,623,930 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0 for the three months ended December
31, 2018. The increase is the result of generating the increased revenue.
 
Operating
Expenses
 
Our
operating expenses, which include software development costs, salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, legal and professional
fees, and general and administrative expenses increased to $8,028,452 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to
$54,754 for the three months ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $7,973,698. The increase is primarily due to stock-based
compensation expense related to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an increase in general
and administrative expenses related to salaries of the new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, coupled with increased
operating expenses to support the increased operations of the business, partially offset by lower expenses from prior officers
for services rendered.
 
On
a comparative, proforma basis, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our operating expenses increased to $1,665,549 for the three months ended December 31, 2019,
compared to $54,754 for the three months ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,610,795. The increase is primarily due to
increased operating expenses to support the increased operations of the business, partially offset by lower expenses from prior
officers for services rendered.
 
Other
(Expense) Income
 
Our
other expense decreased by $164,049, or 133%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily the result
of a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability associated with the convertible promissory notes, partially offset
by increases in expenses and amortization related to the convertible promissory notes and interest expense.
 
Net
Loss from Continuing Operations
 
We
had a net loss from continuing operations of $5,934,763 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of
$63,151 for the three months ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $5,871,612. The increase in net loss is primarily driven
by the increase in operating expenses, partially offset by the increase in gross profit and decrease in other expense, as disclosed
above.
 
On
a comparative, proforma basis, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we generated net income from continuing operations of $428,140 for the three months ended
December 31, 2019, an increase of $491,291. The increase in proforma net income is primarily driven by the increase in gross profit
and decrease in other expense, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses.
 
Discontinued

For
the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there are no revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, other income (expense),
or net income from discontinued operations comparatives. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, income from discontinued
operations was $6,902.

Other
(Expense) Income
 
Our
other expense decreased by $56,441, or 46%, for the six months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily the result of
increases in expenses and amortization related to the convertible promissory notes and interest expense, partially offset by a
gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability associated with the convertible promissory notes.
 
Net
Loss from Continuing Operations
 
We
had a net loss from continuing operations of $16,240,275 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of
$242,986 for the six months ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $15,997,289. The increase in net loss is primarily driven
by the increase in operating expenses and other expense, partially offset by the increase in gross profit, as disclosed above.
 
On
a comparative, proforma basis, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we generated net income from continuing operations of $287,383 for the six months ended December
31, 2019, an increase of $530,369. The increase in proforma net income is primarily driven by the increase in gross profit, partially
offset by increases in operating expenses and other expense.
 
Discontinued
Operations
 
For
the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there are no revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, other income (expense),
or net income from discontinued operations comparatives. For the six months ended December 31, 2018, loss from discontinued operations
was $10,908.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
At
December 31, 2019, we had $106,079 of cash and a working capital deficit of $1,546,818 as compared to cash of $33,996 and a working
capital deficit of $2,440,289 at June 30, 2019.
 
Net
cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was $660,849 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of $71,050 for the six months ended December 31, 2018.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
 
We
have financed our operations since inception primarily through proceeds from equity and debt financings. During the six months
ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $699,800, as compared to $104,131
during the six months ended December 31, 2018. Our continued operations primarily depend upon our ability to raise additional
capital from various sources including equity and debt financings, as well as our revenue derived from operations. We can give
no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs or will be on favorable
terms. Based on our current plans, we believe that our cash provided from the above sources may not be sufficient to enable us
to meet our planned operating needs for the next twelve months.
 
We
believe that private placements of our common stock and convertible debt to be issued from time to time will fund our short-term
capital needs. At December 31, 2019, we had 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock of which 12,667,367 shares were outstanding
and 564,900 shares were to be issued.
 
The
Company expects to continue generating revenues during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019 from its artificial intelligence
and machine learning software platforms. The Company does not expect to derive any material revenue from its nanotechnology product
development until after a deployment and custom tailoring of its Smart Nanobattery.
 
We
have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater
amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales
of our securities, debt or other sources. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable
due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain
whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds
by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our
existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business
plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations
would be materially harmed.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2019 to determine whether the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been
detected.
 
Based
on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019.
 
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
