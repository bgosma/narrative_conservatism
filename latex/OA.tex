Online Appendix Table 1 presents regression results of the above Equation (Column 1) in comparison with the expected tone model results in \cite{huangToneManagement2014} (Column 2). Dependent variable $tone_{i,t}$ is defined as number of net positive words, calculated as total number of positive words minus the sum of total number of negative words and total number of negations. Independent variables are defined in \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C}. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level. ***, ** and * indicate significance at the 1\%, 5\% and 10\% levels in a two-tailed test. The coefficient of MTB in Column 1 is consistent with that in Column 2 in terms of sign, because in the expected tone model of \cite{huangToneManagement2014} the authors use book-to-market ratio instead of market-to-book ratio.

Online Appendix Table 2 presents regression results of Equation (3) using restricted 8-K sample. All observations in restricted 8-K sample are subject to four (five) business day 8-K reporting deadline after (before) May 23rd 2004. TEX represents a vector of textual properties that consists of number of words (NW), tone (TONE) and reporting time lag (TLAG). \textit{Controls} denotes a vector of control variables including firm size (SIZE), market-to-book ratio (MTB) and leverage ratio (LEV). See \hyperref[appb]{Appendix B} and \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C} for textual and financial variable definitions. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level. Column 2, 4 and 6 include firm and time fixed effects and standard errors are clustered at industry level identified by 4-digit SIC codes. ***, ** and * indicate significance at the 1\%, 5\% and 10\% levels in a two-tailed test.
