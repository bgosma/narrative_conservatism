Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.      The accompanying consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto are unaudited. 
In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), these statements include all adjustments, which are
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements
and accompanying disclosures.  Actual
results may be different.  See the
companys 2005 Annual Report for a discussion of the companys critical
accounting estimates.
Interim results
are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  The information included in this Form 10-Q
should be read in conjunction with the companys 2005 Annual Report.
In the first
quarter of 2006, the company made changes to its management system.  These changes impacted the companys
reportable segments and resulted in the reclassification of certain revenue and
cost within its Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  These changes did not impact the companys
total revenue, cost, expense, net income, earnings per share, Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  See Note 10 for additional information
regarding the changes in reportable segments. 
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable
basis.  The company filed a Form 8-K with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, 2006 to reclassify its
historical financial statements and related footnotes to reflect these
management system changes.
Within the
financial tables in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not add due to
the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.  Percentages presented are calculated from the
underlying whole-dollar amounts.

3.      Effective January 1, 2005, the company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. 
Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense is measured at grant date,
based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
employee requisite service period.  The
following table presents total stock-based compensation expense included in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings:

*                    Includes $3 million and $7 million
of credits in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005,
respectively, as a result of awards forfeited in connection with the companys
second-quarter 2005 workforce resource actions.
The reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the three
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006, as compared to the
corresponding periods in the prior year, was principally the result of: (1) a
reduction in the level and fair value of stock option grants ($74 million and
$231 million, respectively), (2) changes to the terms of the companys employee
stock purchase plan, which rendered it non-compensatory in the second quarter
of 2005 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R) (no effect in
three-month period and $18 million decrease in nine-month period), offset by
(3) increased expense for performance-based stock
7 



 
units ($3 million and $30
million, respectively) resulting from changes in the probabilities of achieving
performance metrics and (4) an increase in the level of restricted equity award
grants ($32 million and $52 million, respectively).  The effects on pre-tax stock-based compensation
expense of the 2005 sale of the Personal Computing business were recorded in
Other (income) and expense above and in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005.
As
of September 30, 2006, $1,330 million of total unrecognized compensation
expense related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of approximately 2 years.
There
were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation expense at September
30, 2006 and 2005.
Under IBMs
long-standing practices and policies, all stock option awards are approved
prior to or on the date of grant.  The
exercise price of at-the-money stock options is the average of the high and low
market price on the date of grant or, in the case of premium-priced stock
options, 10 percent above such average. 
The options approval process specifies the individual receiving the
grant, the number of options or the value of the award, the exercise price or
formula for determining the exercise price and the date of grant.  All option awards for senior management are
approved by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of
the Board of Directors (the Committee). 
All option awards for employees other than senior management are
approved by senior management pursuant to a series of delegations that were
approved by the Committee, and the grants made pursuant to these delegations
are reviewed periodically with the Committee. Options that are awarded as part
of annual total compensation for senior management and other employees are made
on specific cycle dates scheduled in advance. With respect to option awards
given in connection with promotions or new hires, IBMs policy requires
approval of such awards prior to the grant date, which is typically the date of
the promotion or the date of hire.  The
exercise price of these options is the average of the high and low market price
on the date of grant in the case of at-the-money stock options or, in the case
of premium-priced stock options, 10 percent above such average.  See IBMs 2005 Annual Report, note U, Stock-Based
Compensation, for additional information on the companys stock-based
incentive awards.
4.      In September 2006, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans that requires
employers to recognize the funded status of their postretirement plans in the
statement of financial position and introduces additional net periodic benefit
cost disclosure requirements. The funded status is measured as the difference
between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company
will adopt SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 158,
the company will recognize the underfunded status of its defined benefit
pension plans and non-pension postretirement benefit plans as a liability in
its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  The overfunded status of the companys
defined benefit pension plans will be recognized as an asset in its Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position. Gains or losses, prior service costs or
credits, and transition assets that have not yet been included in net periodic
benefit cost as of December 31, 2006, will be recognized, net of tax, as
components of the ending
8 



 
balance of Accumulated Gains and (Losses) not
Affecting Retained Earnings. Subsequent to adoption, the company will recognize
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits, net of tax, that arise
during the period but are not recognized in net periodic benefit cost as a
component of Accumulated Gains and (Losses) not Affecting Retained
Earnings.  Those amounts will be adjusted
as they are subsequently recognized in net periodic benefit cost. The company
measures defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of December 31 and SFAS
No. 158 will not affect the companys existing valuation practices.
The adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006
is expected to reduce the companys assets between $11 - 12 billion, decrease
its liabilities between $0.5 - 1.5 billion, and reduce its stockholders equity
between $10 - 11 billion.  The companys
Total stockholders equity was $34.2 billion at September 30, 2006.  The company estimated the effect of adoption
based on the most current valuations of its significant pension and non-pension
postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2005, adjusted for the
remeasurement of certain non-U.S. benefit plans arising from plan amendments
and changes in certain significant assumptions at September 30, 2006.  Those assumptions include the discount rate,
interest crediting rate, fair value of plan assets and foreign exchange
rates.  The current estimate is based on
the expectation that deferred tax assets attributable to pension and
non-pension postretirement benefits will be realized.  The actual effect of adoption could
materially differ from the estimate as a result of changes in assumptions used
in the valuation of plan obligations and fair value of plan assets.  As noted above, those assumptions include,
but are not limited to, discount rates, interest crediting rates, actual fair
value of plan assets, foreign exchange rates, country-specific tax treatment,
and the realizability of deferred tax assets. 
In addition, the company estimates that approximately $1.0 billion of
the liability balance will be reclassified as a current liability in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 158.  The
adoption of SFAS No. 158 will have no impact on the companys existing debt
covenants, credit ratings or financial flexibility.
In September 2006, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements which will become effective in 2008. This Statement defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements; however, it does not require any new
fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 will be applied
prospectively to fair value measurements and disclosures in the companys
Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the first quarter of 2008.
In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, codified as SAB Topic 1.N, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 describes the approach that should be used
to quantify the materiality of a misstatement and provides guidance for
correcting prior year errors.    The company early adopted SAB No. 108 in
the third quarter of 2006 and accordingly, follows SAB No. 108 requirements
when quantifying financial statement misstatements. The adoption of SAB No. 108
did not result in corrections of the companys Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In July 2006, the
FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48).    FIN 48
clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law.  
This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The
9 



 
company will adopt this Interpretation in the first
quarter of 2007.    The cumulative effects, if any, of applying this
Interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to Retained earnings,
Goodwill, or Accumulated Gains and (Losses) not Affecting Retained Earnings, as
appropriate, as of the beginning of the period of adoption.    The company
has commenced the process of evaluating the expected effect of FIN 48 on its
Consolidated Financial Statements and does not presently expect a material
impact upon adoption.  However, the company
does expect to reclassify a portion of its unrecognized tax benefits from
current to non-current liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated
within one year of the balance sheet date. Prior period amounts also will be
reclassified to conform to this change in presentation.
5.      In May 2005, the company implemented a
series of restructuring actions designed to improve the companys efficiencies,
strengthen its client-facing operations and capture opportunities in
high-growth markets. The companys actions primarily included voluntary and
involuntary workforce reductions, with the majority impacting the Global
Services business, primarily in Europe, as well as the vacating of leased
facilities. These actions were in addition to the companys ongoing workforce
reduction and rebalancing activities that occur each quarter.
The total charges
expected to be incurred in connection with all second-quarter 2005 initiatives
are approximately $1,766 million, of which $1,753 million has been recorded
cumulatively through September 30, 2006. The remaining expected charges
represent accretion/interest expense on the long-term portion of the companys
workforce and vacant space obligations. Approximately $1,623 million of the
total charges require cash payments, of which approximately $1,344 million has
been made as of September 30, 2006 and $75 million are expected to be made over
the next 12 months.

Charges incurred
for the workforce reductions consisted of severance/termination benefits for
approximately 16,000 employees (14,500 of which were for the incremental
second-quarter 2005 actions).  All
separations were substantially completed by March 31, 2006.  The non-current portion of the liability
associated with the workforce reductions relates to terminated employees who
were granted annual payments to supplement their income in certain countries.
Depending on individual country legal requirements, these required payments
will continue until the former employee begins receiving pension benefits or is
deceased. Cash payments made through September 30, 2006 associated with the
workforce reductions were $1,259 million.
The vacant space
accruals are primarily for ongoing obligations to pay rent for vacant space,
offset by estimated sublease income, over the respective lease term of the
companys lease agreements. The length of these obligations varies by lease
with the longest extending through 2019.
In connection with the
companys restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of 2005, the
company recorded pre-tax impairment charges for certain real estate assets of
approximately $95 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The
principal component of such impairment charges resulted from the sale of a
facility in Yasu-City, Japan, which closed during the third quarter of 2005. In
connection with this sale, the company recorded an impairment charge to write
the asset down to its fair value in the second quarter of 2005.
These
restructuring activities had the following effect on the companys reportable
segments:

(a)             Other
intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business
processes, methodologies and systems.
The net carrying
amount of intangible assets decreased $64 million during the first nine months
of 2006 due to amortization of existing intangible asset balances partially
offset by additions due to acquisitions.  
The aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $259 million and
$790 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, respectively,
versus $266 million and $775 million for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2005, respectively.  The
aggregate intangible asset amortization expense related to acquired intangible
assets was $66 million and $225 million for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2006, respectively, versus $95 million and $281 million for the
comparable prior year periods.  In
addition, in the first nine months of 2006, the company retired $964 million of
fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and
accumulated amortization for this amount.
The amortization
expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to intangible assets
currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is
estimated to be the following at September 30, 2006:

8.      During the nine months
ended September 30, 2006, the company completed nine acquisitions at an
aggregate cost of $1,042 million.
The Software segment
completed seven acquisitions: in the first quarter, Micromuse, a publicly
traded company; Cims Lab, a privately held company; and Language Analysis
Systems, Inc., a privately held company; in the second quarter, Buildforge, a
privately held company; Unicorn Solutions, Inc., a privately held company; and
Rembo Technology, a privately held company; and, in the third quarter, Webify
Solutions, a privately held company. 
Each acquisition further complemented and enhanced the companys
portfolio of software product offerings.
Global Technology
Services (GTS) completed one acquisition in the first quarter: Viacore, Inc., a
privately held company.  This acquisition
augments GTSs supply chain optimization practice within its Business
Transformation Outsourcing offerings.
Global Business Systems
(GBS) completed one acquisition in the third quarter: Valchemy, Inc., a
privately held company.  This acquisition
will enhance the companys Business Consulting Services offerings.
Purchase price
consideration was paid all in cash. 
These acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
The table below reflects
the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase
price allocations as of September 30, 2006. 
The Micromuse acquisition is shown separately given its significant

The acquisitions were
accounted for as purchase transactions, and accordingly, the assets and
liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that generated the
goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired companies and IBM and the acquired assembled
workforce, neither of which qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. The
company is currently analyzing the amount
18 



 
of goodwill that is
deductible for tax purposes.  The overall
weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired
is 4.2 years.  With the exception of goodwill,
these identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis
over their useful lives.  Goodwill of
$865 million has been assigned to the Software ($860 million) and Global
Technology Services ($5 million) segments. 
There was no goodwill recorded for the Global Business Services segment.
On
August 3, 2006, the company announced that it had agreed to acquire MRO
Software Inc., a publicly-held company, for approximately $740 million.  On October 5, 2006, the company completed its
acquisition of MRO Software Inc.  On
August 9, 2006 the company announced that it had agreed to acquire FileNet
Corporation, a publicly-held company, for approximately $1.6 billion.  On October 12, 2006, the company completed
its acquisition of FileNet Corporation. 
On August 23, 2006 the company announced that it had agreed to acquire
Internet Security Systems, Inc., a publicly-held company, for approximately
$1.3 billion.  On October 20, 2006, the
company completed its acquisition of Internet Security Systems.  The details of these acquisitions will be
included in the companys 2006 Form 10-K.
9.      On April 30, 2005 (closing
date), the company completed the divestiture of its Personal Computing
Division (PCD) business to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo), a  publicly traded company on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.  For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the company recorded a total pre-tax gain of $1,108 million
of which $1,112 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2005.
As
part of the total consideration received at the closing date, the company
received equity in Lenovo.  The equity is
subject to specific lock-up provisions that restrict the company from divesting
the securities.  The restrictions apply
to specific equity tranches and expire over a three-year period from the closing
date.  In the second quarter of 2006, the
company and Lenovo agreed to revise these restrictions such that the company
can now fully divest its shares in Lenovo after November 1, 2007 versus the
prior lock-up expiration date of May 1, 2008.
On
August 4, 2006, the company signed an agreement with a financial institution to
establish a structure, with the institution acting as agent, to facilitate the
companys disposition of Lenovo shares from time-to-time, after their release
from the lock-up provisions.  At the end
of the third quarter, the company had not divested any shares through the
financial institution.
See
IBMs 2005 Annual Report, note C, Acquisitions/Divestitures, for additional
information.
10.    The tables on pages 81
through 84 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results of the companys reportable
segments consistent with the management system used by the companys chief
operating decision maker. These results are not necessarily a depiction that is
in conformity with GAAP.
For example, employee retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial
assumptions on a country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments based
on headcount. A different result may occur for any segment if actuarial
assumptions unique to each segment were used. Performance measurement is based
on income before income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in
part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating
resources to, each of the segments.
19 



 
As discussed in Note 1,
in the first quarter of 2006, the company made changes to its management system
that impacted the companys reportable segments.  The Enterprise Investment segment was dissolved and the Product Lifecycle
Management software business was transferred to the Software segment.  Certain other investments and products
previously managed as Enterprise Investments are now included in the Software,
Systems and Technology Group and Global Services segments.
In addition, the company
made changes in the management system of its Global Services business.  These changes include the separation of the
Global Services segment into two new reportable segments: Global Technology
Services and Global Business Services.
The two new Global
Services segments consist of the following:
The Global Technology
Services (GTS) segment primarily reflects infrastructure services, delivering
value through the companys global scale, standardization and automation.  It includes outsourcing, both Strategic
Outsourcing and Business Transformation Outsourcing, Integrated Technology
Services and Maintenance.
The Global Business
Services (GBS) segment primarily reflects professional services, delivering
business value and innovation to clients through solutions which leverage
industry and business process expertise. 
It includes consulting, systems integration and application management
services (AMS).
In the second quarter of
2005, the company divested its Personal Computing business which was previously
a part of the Personal Systems Group. 
The two remaining units of the former Personal Systems Group, Retail
Store Solutions and Printing Systems, were combined with the Systems and
Technology Group. The Personal Computing business financial results are
displayed as part of the segment disclosures, for applicable periods presented,
in a manner consistent with the segment disclosures.
Previously reported
segment information on pages 81 through 84 has been reclassified for all
periods presented to reflect these changes in the companys reportable
segments.
11.    The following table
provides a rollforward of the liability balances for actions taken in the
following periods: (1) the second quarter of 2005, discussed in Note 5; (2) the
second-quarter of 2002 associated with the Microelectronics Division and
rebalancing of both the companys workforce and leased space resources; (3) the
fourth-quarter 2002 actions associated with the acquisition of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting business; (4) the 2002 actions associated
with the hard disk drive (HDD) business for reductions in workforce,
manufacturing capacity
and space; (5) the actions taken in 1999; and (6) actions that took place prior
to 1994.

other adjustments column in the table above principally includes the
reclassification of non-current to current and foreign currency translation
adjustments. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30,
2006, net adjustments to decrease previously recorded liabilities for changes
in the estimated cost of employee terminations and vacant space were recorded
for the 2002 actions ($17 million) and the 2Q 2005 actions ($27 million),
offset by increases for the actions taken prior to 1999 ($7 million). These
adjustments resulted in net reductions of $37 million, $19 million were
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings during the nine month period
ended September 30, 2006, with $16 million included in Selling, General and
Administrative expense and $3 million in Other (income) and expense.
Additionally, adjustments of $18 million for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2006, were recorded to Goodwill for changes to estimated vacant space and
workforce reserves associated with the 2002 actions.
12.    The company is involved in
a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from time
to time in the ordinary course of its business, including actions with respect
to contracts, intellectual property (IP), product liability, employment,
benefits, securities, and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced
by a number of different constituents, including competitors, partners,
clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies,
stockholders, and representatives of the locations in which the company does
business. The following is a discussion of some of the more significant legal
matters involving the company.
On July 31, 2003, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, in Cooper  et al. v. The IBM Personal Pension Plan  and IBM Corporation, held that the companys
pension plan violated the age discrimination provisions of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). On September 29, 2004, the
company announced that IBM and plaintiffs agreed in principle to resolve
certain claims in the litigation. That agreement was finalized by the parties
in May 2005, and received final approval from the District Court on August 16,
2005. Under the terms of the agreement, plaintiffs will receive an incremental
pension benefit in exchange for the settlement of some claims and a stipulated
remedy on remaining claims if plaintiffs prevail on appeal. This settlement,
together with a previous settlement of a claim referred to as the partial plan
termination claim resulted in the company taking a one-time charge of $320
million in the third quarter of 2004.
This agreement ends the litigation on all claims
except the two claims associated with IBMs cash balance formula. The company
continues to believe that its pension plan formulas are fair and legal. The
company reached this agreement in the interest of the business and the companys
shareholders, and to allow for a review of its cash balance formula by the
Court of
21 



 
Appeals. The agreement stipulated that if the company was not
successful on appeal of the two remaining claims, the agreed remedy would be
increased by up to $1.4 billion$780 million for the claim that the companys cash
balance formula is age discriminatory, and $620 million for the claim that the
method used to establish opening account balances during the 1999 conversion
discriminated on the basis of age (referred to as the always cash balance
claim). The maximum additional liability the company could face in this case
were it not successful on appeal is therefore capped at $1.4 billion.
On August 30, 2005, the
company filed its Notice of Appeal of the liability rulings on the cash balance
claims with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the matter was
subsequently fully briefed. On February 16, 2006, oral arguments on the appeal
were heard by the Court of Appeals.  On
August 7, 2006, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of IBMs appeal.  The Court of Appeals found that neither IBMs
cash balance formula, nor the method  by
which opening account balances were established during the 1999 conversion,
were age discriminatory.  On August 21,
2006, plaintiffs petitioned the Court of Appeals for a rehearing of the appeal.  On September 1, 2006, the Court of Appeals
denied plaintiffs petition for a rehearing.  
Plaintiffs have until November 30, 2006 to request that the Supreme
Court agree to consider their appeal of the ruling of the Court of Appeals.
The company is a defendant
in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City, Utah by
The SCO Group. The company removed the case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff
is an alleged successor in interest to some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and
alleges copyright infringement, unfair competition, interference with contract
and breach of contract with regard to the companys distribution of AIX and
Dynix and contribution of code to Linux. The company has asserted
counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation of the Lanham Act,
unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive trade practices,
breach of the General Public License that governs open source distributions,
promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005, the company withdrew
its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and focus the issues in the
case and to expedite their resolution. Each of the parties has filed a motion
for summary judgment.  A trial date has
not been set.
In May 2005, the
Louisiana Supreme Court denied the companys motion to review and reverse a
Louisiana state courts certification of a nationwide class in a case filed
against the company in 1995. The class consists of certain former employees who
left the company in 1992, and their spouses. They claim damages based on the
companys termination of an education assistance program. On April 4, 2006, the
trial court denied the companys motion for summary judgment. On June 26, 2006,
the Louisiana Court of Appeals denied IBMs writ seeking an interlocutory
appeal of the trial courts decision to deny summary judgment. On July 26, 2006
IBM filed a writ seeking a discretionary appeal with the Louisiana Supreme
Court. The court has not yet ruled on the writ. 
No date has been set for trial.
On June 2, 2003, the
company announced that it received notice of a formal, nonpublic investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC sought information
relating to revenue recognition in 2000 and 2001 primarily concerning certain
types of client transactions. The company believes that the investigation
arises from a separate investigation by the SEC of Dollar General Corporation,
a client of the companys Retail Stores Solutions unit, which markets and sells
point-of-sale products.
22 



 
On January 8, 2004, the
company announced that it received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC
in connection with the staffs investigation of Dollar General Corporation,
which as noted above, is a client of the companys Retail Stores Solutions
unit. It is the companys understanding that an employee in the companys Sales
& Distribution unit also received a Wells Notice from the SEC in connection
with this matter. The Wells Notice notifies the company that the SEC staff is
considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil action against the company
for possible violations of the U.S. securities laws relating to Dollar Generals
accounting for a specific transaction, by participating in and aiding and
abetting Dollar Generals misstatement of its 2000 results. In that
transaction, the company paid Dollar General $11 million for certain used
equipment as part of a sale of IBM replacement equipment in Dollar Generals
2000 fourth fiscal quarter. Under the SECs procedures, the company responded
to the SEC staff regarding whether any action should be brought against the
company by the SEC. The separate SEC investigation noted above, relating to the
recognition of revenue by the company in 2000 and 2001 primarily concerning
certain types of client transactions, is not the subject of this Wells Notice.
On June 27, 2005, the
company announced that it had received a request to voluntarily comply with an
informal investigation by the staff of the SEC concerning the companys
disclosures relating to the companys first quarter 2005 earnings and expensing
of equity compensation. On January 12, 2006, the company announced that it
received notice of a formal, nonpublic investigation by the SEC of this matter.
The company has been cooperating with the SEC, and will continue to do so. The
SEC has informed the company that the investigation should not be construed as
an indication that any violations of law have occurred.
In July 2005, two
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York related to the companys disclosures concerning
first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity compensation. One
lawsuit named as defendants IBM and IBMs Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. The other lawsuit named as defendants IBM, IBMs Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, and IBMs Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. Both complaints alleged that defendants made certain
misrepresentations in violation of Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On September 6,
2005, counsel in one of these lawsuits filed a motion seeking to have the
lawsuits consolidated, and for the appointment of lead plaintiff and lead
counsel. Pursuant to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006, the two
lawsuits were consolidated into a single action captioned In re International
Business Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. Pursuant to a schedule set by
the Court, Plaintiffs served on the company an Amended Consolidated Complaint
on May 19, 2006. IBM filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Consolidated
Complaint on June 23, 2006. Plaintiffs filed their response to IBMs Motion on
July 21, 2006; and IBM filed its final brief in support of its Motion on August
2, 2006.  On September 20, 2006, the
Court denied IBMs Motion to Dismiss.
In January 2004, the
Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea announced it had brought
criminal bid-rigging charges against several companies, including IBM Korea and
LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and LG Electronics, which has since
been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and had also charged employees of some
of those entities with, among other things, bribery of certain officials of
government-controlled entities in Korea and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM
cooperated fully with authorities in these matters. A number of individuals,
including former IBM Korea and LG IBM employees, were subsequently found guilty
and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM were also required to pay fines. Debarment
orders
23 



 
were imposed at different times, covering a period of no more than a
year from the date of issuance, which barred IBM Korea from doing business
directly with certain government controlled entities in Korea. All debarment
orders have since expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM
Korea from selling products and services to business partners who sold to
government-controlled entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of
Justice and the SEC have both contacted the company in connection with this
matter.
On January 24, 2006, a
putative class action lawsuit was filed against IBM in federal court in San
Francisco on behalf of technical support workers whose primary responsibilities
are or were to install and maintain computer software and hardware. The
complaint was subsequently amended on March 13, 2006. The First Amended
Complaint, among other things, adds four additional named plaintiffs and
modifies the definition of the workers purportedly included in the class. The
suit, Rosenburg, et. al., v. IBM, alleges the company failed to pay overtime
wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law, and asserts
violations of various state wage requirements, including recordkeeping and
meal-break provisions. The suit also asserts certain violations of ERISA.
Relief sought includes back wages, corresponding 401K and pension plan credits,
interest, and attorneys fees.
On October 23, 2006, the
company filed two lawsuits against Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, one in the Lufkin
Division and one in the Tyler Division. 
The Lufkin suit alleges that Amazon has unlawfully infringed three IBM
patents.  The Tyler suit alleges that
Amazon has unlawfully infringed two IBM patents.  The Lufkin Division patents cover methods for
storing data, presenting applications and presenting advertising on a computer
network.  The Tyler Division patents
cover an electronic catalog requisition system and related information
retrieval and ordering methods and a computer-implemented hypertext system and
method for operating a computer implemented object-oriented hypertext
system.  Each suit seeks, among other
things, compensatory damages and injunctive relief.  No date has been set for trial in either
lawsuit.
The company is party to,
or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state
environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws
similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to
participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations or
remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites
pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with state
environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning
certain current or former operating sites.
The company is also
subject to ongoing tax examinations and 
governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Similar to many other
U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various
challenges with Brazilian authorities regarding non income tax assessments and
non income tax litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims
for taxes on the importation of computer software. The total amounts related to
these matters are approximately $1.4 billion, including amounts currently in
litigation and other amounts.  The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that these amounts are
not meaningful indicators of liability.
In accordance with SFAS
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the company records a provision with
respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that
a
24 



 
liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any provisions
are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impact and
status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information
pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities for the above items,
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended September  30, 2006, were not material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its experience, the company
believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters referred to above are
not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters previously discussed. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters, it is
possible that the companys business, financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the
resolution of one or more of these matters.
Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow
will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses; damages or remedies may have on the
companys Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and
circumstances of the particular matter which may give rise to additional
factors.
13.    The companys extended
lines of credit to clients and other third parties include unused amounts of
$3,341 million and $3,019 million at September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
respectively.  A portion of these amounts
was available to the companys business partners to support their working
capital needs. In addition, the company committed to provide future financing
to its customers in connection with customer purchase agreements for
approximately $2,449 million and $2,155 million at September 30, 2006 and December
31, 2005, respectively.
The company has applied
the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, to its
agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions
expand those required by SFAS
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, by requiring a guarantor to disclose
certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors
performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which
the company is the guarantor.
The company is a party to
a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the
other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise
in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the
company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising
from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title
to the assets sold, certain IP rights, specified environmental matters, and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making an adverse claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically
allow the company to challenge the other partys claims. Further, the companys
obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or
amount, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third
parties for certain payments made by the company.
25 



 
It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements did not have
a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.   The company believes that
if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, such loss would not have a
material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.
In addition, the company
guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential
future payment under these financial guarantees was $31 million and $39 million
at September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
Changes in the companys
warranty liability balance are presented in the following table:

generally accepted accounting principles. 
There was no loss from Discontinued Operations in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2006, respectively, versus 
no losses in the third quarter of 2005 and $27 million in the  first nine months of 2005.  The 2005 charges were for additional costs
associated with parts warranty as agreed upon by the company and Hitachi Ltd.,
under the terms of the agreement for the sale of the HDD business to Hitachi
Ltd.

percent adjusted for currency
The companys
third-quarter 2006 diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations
of $1.45 increased 54 percent versus $0.94 in the third quarter of 2005.  The third- quarter 2005 diluted earnings per
share from continuing operations included a $0.32 per share one-time tax charge
related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004; excluding the one-time tax charge, the third quarter
diluted earnings per share increased 15 percent versus the prior year quarter.
Third quarter and
first nine months of 2006 income from continuing operations was $2,222 million
and $5,952 million versus $1,516 million and $4,774 million for the comparable
periods in 2005, respectively. The third-quarter 2005 results included a
one-time tax charge of $525 million associated with the repatriation of $9.5
billion of foreign earnings.  The first
nine months of 2005 included the third quarter tax repatriation charge and the
pretax charges for the companys incremental restructuring actions of $1,731
million, offset by a $1,112 million gain on the divestiture of the Personal
Computing business and a $775 million legal settlement received from Microsoft.
Total revenue
increased 5.1 percent and declined 2.3 percent (up 3.7 percent and down 1.6
percent adjusted for currency) for the third quarter and first nine months of
2006 versus the same periods in 2005. 
The decline in the first nine months of 2006 was primarily driven by the
28 



divestiture of the
Personal Computing business in April 2005. 
The nine months of 2005 results have four months of Personal Computing
revenue versus no activity in 2006. 
Excluding revenue from the divested Personal Computing business, the
first nine months revenue of 2006 increased 2.1 percent (2.9 percent adjusted
for currency).
In the third
quarter, the companys performance reflected the strength of its business
model, with good contribution from the companys high value, high margin
businesses. The company also benefited from good sales execution at the end of
the quarter which enabled closure of key transactions that contributed to the
revenue and profit growth.
The companys
Software business had solid growth in revenue and pre-tax profit and was the
largest profit contributor in the quarter. 
The software results once again reflected strong demand for products
deploying Services Oriented Architecture and Information on Demand, as well as
the value of the companys systems management, security, and storage
offerings.  The company is continuing to
invest both internally and to execute a targeted acquisition strategy.  In the third quarter the company announced
acquisitions that will continue to build its capabilities, while contributing
growth and cash flow to the overall portfolio.
In Hardware, the
company also had solid results, led by strong growth in its System z business
and good performance in System p, Systems Storage, and Microelectronics.
Global Services
revenue grew modestly, however the growth rate improved versus the second
quarter.  The Global Services business
continues to provide a solid profit base and continued profit dollar and margin
improvement for the company.
On a geographic
basis, Asia Pacific had the best year-to-year revenue growth, adjusted for
currency, helped by improved results in Japan. 
In addition, each of the other four major regions in the geography
posted double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter.  The companys ongoing investment in its
emerging countries, in aggregate, yielded continued strong growth in those
markets.
The gross profit
margin was 42.0 percent and 40.8 percent in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2006 versus 40.6 percent and 38.6 percent in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2005.  The
year-to-year improvement  in the
third-quarter 2006 gross profit margin was primarily driven by the benefits
from the companys ongoing productivity initiatives and a favorable mix of
revenue towards the companys higher margin businesses.  The increase in the first nine months of 2006
gross profit margin was primarily driven by the divestiture of the  Personal Computing business (1.4 points) and
benefits from the productivity initiatives implemented in the second quarter of
2005.
In the third
quarter of 2006, total expense and other income increased over the prior year
period, primarily due to increased Selling, general and administrative expense
associated with the companys ongoing investments in sales skills, emerging
markets and its strategic acquisitions. 
In addition, continued workforce rebalancing and retirement-related
plans expense increased in the third quarter of 2006 versus the third quarter
of 2005.  In the first nine months of
2006,  total expense and other income
declined versus the same period in 2005, primarily due to the divestiture of
the Personal Computing business and benefits from the productivity initiatives
initiated in the second quarter of 2005. 
The ratio of Total expense to revenue increased 0.9
29 



points and 0.6 points to
27.9 percent and 27.8 percent, for the third quarter and first nine months of
2006 versus the comparable periods of 2005, respectively.
The effective tax
rates for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 were 30.0 percent and 48.0
percent, respectively. The corresponding effective tax rates for the first nine
months of 2006 and 2005 were 30.0 percent and 37.7 percent, respectively. The
decreases in the quarterly and nine months tax rates were primarily
attributable to the absence of the foreign earnings repatriation-related tax
charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005.
Assets declined
approximately $1.6 billion from December 31, 2005 to September 30, 2006
primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of
$2.8 billion due to pension funding, acquisitions, tax payments, dividend
payments and share repurchases in the first nine months of 2006. In addition,
receivables declined by $1.9 billion during the first nine months of 2006.  These decreases were partially offset by an
increase in pension assets of $2.6 billion and goodwill of approximately $0.9
billion.
Total Global
Services signings were $10.5 billion in the third quarter of 2006 as compared
to $11.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2005.  The estimated total Global Services backlog
was $109 billion at September 30, 2006, flat versus June 30, 2006 and down $2
billion from December 31, 2005.

On April 30, 2005,
the company sold its Personal Computing business.  Accordingly, the companys reported revenue
results for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, do not include
any Personal Computer revenue.  The first
nine months of 2005 includes Personal Computer revenue for four months, while
the first nine months of  2006 does not
include any Personal Computer revenue. 
The company has presented a discussion on changes in reported revenues
along with a  discussion of revenue
results excluding the divested Personal Computing business.  The company 
believes that a more appropriate discussion is one that excludes the
revenue results from the Personal Computing 
business from the first nine months of 2005 because it presents the
results on a comparable  basis and
provides a more meaningful discussion which focuses on the companys ongoing
operational performance.  Such discussion
is presented starting on page 36.
As-reported
revenue from all industry sectors and Small and Medium Business increased in
the third quarter of 2006 when compared to the same three months of 2005.  The Financial Services Sector revenue
increase was driven by Banking (10.0 percent) and Financial Markets (11.5
percent).  The Public Sector had growth
in Government (2.7 percent) that was largely offset by a decline in Education
(17.0 percent). Revenue growth in the Industrial Sector was driven by Chemical
and Petroleum (18.2 percent) and Automotive (4.6 percent) while Industrial
Products and Aerospace declined 12.4 percent and 7.9 percent,
respectively.  The Distribution Sector,
while essentially flat, had revenue increases in the  Retail Industry (3.4 percent) that was
largely offset by declining revenue in Consumer Products  (5.4 percent). All industry units within the
33 



Communications Sector
experienced revenue growth led by Telecommunications (7.4 percent) and
Utilities (16.6 percent). Revenue from Small and Medium Business increased 6.7
percent in the third quarter of 2006 when compared to the third quarter of 2005
with increases across all geographic markets.
As-reported
revenue for the first nine months of 2006 declined in all industry sectors,
with the exception of Financial Services and Communications,  primarily due to the divestiture of the
Personal Computing business.  The
Financial Services Sector revenue increase was driven by Banking (5.6
percent).  The decrease in Public Sector
revenue was driven by Government (5.1 percent) and Education (28.6
percent).  The Industrial Sector revenue
decline was driven by Automotive (5.6 percent), Industrial Products (12.9
percent) and Electronics (3.1 percent). The decline in Distribution Sector
revenue was driven by Travel and Transportation (6.5 percent) and Retail (2.1
percent).  Communications Sector
revenue  was unchanged with increased
revenue in Utilities (5.7 percent) being offset by declines in Media and
Entertainment (4.6 percent) and Telecommunications (0.4 percent).  Revenue from Small and Medium Business
declined in all geographic markets, with a double digit decline in the Asia
Pacific geography.
Geographic revenue
performance, presented below and in the tables on page 33, exclude OEM revenue,
which is presented separately. 
Country-specific and regional growth rates include OEM revenue.
Revenue growth
increased in all geographic markets in the third quarter of 2006 when compared
to the third quarter of 2005.
Revenue in the
Americas geography increased  2.8 percent
(1.8 percent adjusted for currency) versus the third quarter of 2005.  By region, Latin America increased 16.6
percent (12.4 percent adjusted for currency), Canada was up 5.0 percent (down
1.8 percent adjusted for currency) and the U.S. increased 3.6 percent, driven
by strong OEM revenue.  The U.S. revenue
growth excluding OEM was 1.2 percent.
Europe/Middle-East/Africa
(EMEA) geographic revenue increased in the third quarter 6.4 percent (2.3
percent adjusted for currency) versus the same period in 2005.  Performance across the geography improved
with increased revenue in all major countries. The U.K grew 10.9 percent (5.6
percent adjusted for currency), Italy 6.5 percent, (1.9 percent adjusted for
currency), France 6.1 percent, (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), Spain 9.1
percent (4.3 percent adjusted for currency) and Germany 3.2 percent (down 1.3
percent adjusted for currency)  versus
the third quarter of 2005.
In the Asia
Pacific geography, revenue increased 4.2 percent (6.4 percent adjusted for
currency) versus the third quarter of 2005. 
Double-digit revenue increases in China of 28.6 percent (27.2 percent
adjusted for currency), India 29.7 percent (36.7 percent adjusted for currency)
and Korea 19.6 percent (10.8 percent adjusted for currency) were partially
offset by decreased revenue in Japan of 5.6 percent (1.3 percent adjusted for
currency). Japan represents over half of the Asia Pacific revenue base and its
performance in the third quarter improved over that of prior quarters;
excluding OEM, revenue declined 5.0 percent (flat adjusted for currency).
 
34





 
Revenue in the key
emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together grew 22.5
percent (19.4 percent adjusted for currency) versus the same period of
2005.  India again had the strongest
growth at 29.7 percent (36.7 percent adjusted for currency), China grew 28.6
percent (27.2 percent adjusted for currency) and Brazil 20.8 percent (12.7
percent adjusted for currency). Revenue in Russia declined in the third
quarter  6.6 percent (6.6 percent
adjusted for currency).  The company
continues to invest to build capabilities in these countries both to address
the fast-growing domestic market opportunities and to enhance its globally
integrated operations.
OEM revenue
increased 24.3 percent (24.3 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter of 2006 versus the same period of 2005, driven by strong game chip
performance in the companys Microelectronics business.
Revenue growth by
geography in the first nine months of 2006, when compared to the same period of
2005, was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the Personal Computing
business.
Americas
geographic revenue in the first nine months of 2006 increased 0.3 percent (down
0.9  percent adjusted for currency)
versus the first nine month period of 2005. 
Revenue increased in all regions with Latin America up 6.6 percent (flat
adjusted for currency), Canada increased 2.5 percent (down 5.1 percent adjusted
for currency) and the U.S. was up 2.0 percent driven by strong OEM revenue.
In the EMEA
geography, revenue declined 4.0 percent (2.6 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first nine months of 2006 versus the same period in 2005.  Revenue declined in Germany 7.0 percent (5.7
percent adjusted for currency), Italy 4.5 percent (3.1 percent adjusted for
currency) and the UK 3.5 percent (2.2 percent adjusted for currency), partially
offset by increases in France 0.4 percent (1.6 percent adjusted for currency)
and Spain 0.2 percent (1.5 percent adjusted for currency).
Revenue in the
Asia Pacific geography decreased 9.6 percent (5.8 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first nine months of 2006 versus the same period in 2005.  Japan revenue declined 14.2 percent (7.7
percent adjusted for currency) and China was also down 7.2 percent (8.5 percent
adjusted for currency); partially offsetting these declines were revenue
increases in India of 19.1 percent (23.7 percent adjusted for currency) and
Korea of 13.0 percent (6.3 percent adjusted for currency).
Revenue in the key
emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together increased 5.7
percent (0.8 percent adjusted for currency) versus the same period of
2005.  Growth in India 19.1 percent (23.7
percent adjusted for currency),  Brazil
15.8 percent (2.4 percent adjusted for currency) and Russia 4.8 percent (4.8
percent adjusted for currency) was partially offset by lower revenue in China
7.2 percent (8.5 percent adjusted for currency).
OEM revenue
increased 27.9 percent (28.0 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine
months of 2006  versus the same period in
2005, driven by strong game chip performance in the companys Microelectronics
business.

The discussion
below on sector and geographic revenues refers to the previous tables excluding
the Personal Computing business external revenue, in order to present the
companys results on a comparable basis year-to-year, and best present the
companys ongoing operational performance.
For the first nine
months of 2006, revenue increases in Small and Medium Business, the Financial
Services Sector and the Communications Sector were partially offset by declines
in the other industry sectors when compared to the same period in 2005.  The Financial Services Sector revenue
increase was driven by Banking (7.4 percent) and was partially offset by
declines in Financial Markets (3.2 percent) and Insurance (1.2 percent).   The decrease in Public Sector revenue was
driven by declines in Government (1.9 percent) and Education (15.5 percent),
partially offset by increased revenue in Health (4.7 percent).  The Industrial Sector revenue decline was
driven by Automotive (3.9 percent) and Industrial Products (10.4 percent),
partially offset by increases in Chemical and Petroleum (12.2 percent).  Distribution Sector revenue decreased driven
by Travel and Transportation (4.8 percent) and Retail (1.0 percent), partially
offset by increased revenue in Consumer Products (5.4 percent).  Revenue increased in the Communications
Sector driven by Utilities (8.9 percent) and Telecommunications (1.4
percent).  Revenue increases in Small and
Medium Business were experienced in all geographic markets led by growth in the
Americas (7.1 percent).
Geographic revenue
performance, presented below and in the table above, exclude OEM revenue, which
is presented separately. 
Country-specific and regional growth rates include OEM revenue.
Revenue in the
Americas geography grew 4.3 percent (3.0 percent adjusted for currency) versus
the first nine months  of  2005 with growth in all regions. Latin
America  increased 14.9 percent (7.7
percent adjusted for currency), Canada was up 8.3 percent (0.3 percent adjusted
for currency) and the U.S. increased 5.4 percent driven by strong OEM revenue.
The U.S. revenue growth excluding OEM was 3.0 percent.
EMEA geographic
revenue was flat (up 1.4 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine
months of 2006 versus 2005 with mixed results by country.  France and Spain showed growth, 3.8 percent
(5.1 percent adjusted for currency) and 3.0 percent (4.4 percent adjusted for
currency), respectively, versus the prior year period. Revenue declined in
Germany 3.6 percent
37 



(2.3 percent adjusted for
currency), Italy 1.9 percent (0.6 percent adjusted for currency) and the UK 0.2
percent (up 1.1 percent adjusted for currency) versus the first nine months of
2005.
In the Asia
Pacific geography, revenue decreased 3.4 percent (increased 0.7 percent
adjusted for currency) versus the first nine months of 2005.  Japan revenue declined 11.0 percent (4.2
percent adjusted for currency). 
Partially offsetting these declines were revenue increases in China 14.0
percent (12.4 percent adjusted for currency), 
India 41.0 percent (46.4 percent adjusted for currency) and Korea 15.2
percent (8.4 percent adjusted for currency).
Revenue in the key
emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together grew 20.4
percent (14.9 percent adjusted for currency) versus the same period of 2005, as
the company continues to expand its capabilities in these countries. India
again had the strongest growth at 41.0 percent (46.4 percent adjusted for
currency), Brazil grew 20.9 percent (7.0 percent adjusted for currency), Russia
increased 14.1 percent (14.1 percent adjusted for currency) and China grew 14.0
percent (12.4 percent adjusted for currency).
Global Services
revenue increased 2.7 percent and 0.2 percent (1.6 percent and 1.3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006,
respectively. In the third quarter, the revenue growth rate improved
sequentially in both Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.
Hardware revenue
increased  8.9 percent and 5.1 percent
(7.7 percent and 5.3 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2006, respectively, compared to the same periods in
2005.  The increase in Hardware revenue
was driven by strong performance in System z, while System p, Systems Storage
and Microelectronics also had good revenue growth in the third quarter of 2006.
These increases were partially offset by a decline in System i servers.
Software revenue
increased 8.5 percent and 5.2 percent (6.7 percent and 5.9 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, respectively,
versus the same periods last year.  The
revenue increase was driven by growth of 20.0 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively,
in the companys key branded middleware products, partially offset by decreases
in operating systems products of 6.1 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.
See pages 46 to 56
for additional information regarding Global Services, Hardware and Software
segment results.
Global Financing
revenue declined 1.5 percent and 2.6 percent (3.2 percent and 2.4 percent  adjusted for currency) in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2005, respectively, versus the same periods in
2005.  The declines were primarily driven
by a decrease in remarketing equipment sales. 
See pages 64 to 71 for additional information regarding Global Financing
results.

The increase in the Global Services gross profit
margins was due primarily to the benefits from the companys productivity
initiatives and cost efficiencies, including improved utilization.  The increase in Hardware gross profit margin
in the first nine months of 2006 was due to the sale of the Personal Computing
business (which had a lower gross profit margin than the other hardware
products) in the second quarter of 2005. 
The Hardware margin declined without the benefits received from the sale
of the Personal Computing business (see page 53 for additional
information).  The decrease in Global
Financing gross profit margins was driven by declining financing margins primarily due to the changing
short-term interest rate environment.
Expense
The Total expense
and other income expense-to-revenue ratio increased  0.9 points and 0.6 points to 27.9 percent and
27.8 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006,
respectively,  versus the same periods of
2005.  The increase in the
expense-to-revenue ratio in the third quarter was due to the 8.5 percent
increase in expense, partially offset by the 5.1 percent increase in revenue.
The increase in expense-to-revenue ratio in the first nine months was driven by
the 2.3 percent decrease in revenue, partially offset by a  0.1 percent decrease in expense.  For additional information regarding Total
expense and other income, see the following analyses by category.

Total Selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 10.5 percent (9.3
percent adjusted for currency) and decreased 8.9 percent (8.5 percent adjusted
for currency), respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006
versus the same periods in 2005.  The
increase in the third quarter of 2006 was primarily due to increased expense
associated with the companys ongoing investments in sales skills, emerging
markets and its strategic acquisitions. 
The decrease in the first nine months of 2006 was primarily due to the
restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2005.  (See Note 5 on pages 10 through 12 for
additional information). In addition, stock-based compensation expense and
retirement-related expense declined in the first nine months of 2006 versus the
comparable period of 2005.  (See Note 3
on pages 7 and 8 for additional information regarding stock-based compensation
expense and Note 6 on pages 13 to 16 for additional information regarding
retirement-related expense).

Other (income) and
expense was income of $174 million in the third quarter 2006 versus income of
$99 million in the third quarter of 2005. 
Interest income increased $52 million in the third quarter of 2006
versus the same period in 2005 reflecting the companys higher cash balance and
increasing interest rates.  Other
(income) and expense was income of $616 million in the first nine months of
2006 versus income of $1,788 million in the first nine months of 2005.  The decrease year-to-year was primarily
driven by the gain associated with the sale of the Personal Computing business
to Lenovo on April 30, 2005.  The pretax
gain recorded through the third-quarter 2005 associated with this transaction
was $1,112 million. (See Note 9 on page 19 for additional information).  In addition, on June 30, 2005, the company
settled certain antitrust issues with the Microsoft Corporation and the gain
from this settlement was $775 million. 
The Personal Computing business divestiture and Microsoft gain amounts
are reflected in the Other line in the nine month table above.  The company also recorded real estate-related
restructuring charges of $235 million in the second quarter of 2005 (see Note 5
on pages 10 through  12 for additional
information). Interest income increased $220 million in the first nine
41 



months of 2006 versus the
same period in 2005 reflecting the companys higher cash balance and increasing
interest rates.  Impacts related to
foreign currency-transaction gains and losses and derivative instrumentsimproved
$271 million in the first nine months of 2006 versus the same period last year.

The increase for
the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 was primarily due to increased
spending in the Systems and Technology Group ($34 million and $75 million), as
well as increased spending in Software ($62 million and $102 million),
partially offset by lower spending in the Personal Computing Division ($0
million and $48 million) as a result of the divestiture of that unit.  In addition, retirement-related expense
increased $7 million and $24 million in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2006 versus the same periods of 2005, respectively, and stock-based
compensation expense declined $4 million and $18 million in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2006 versus the comparable periods in 2005.

The timing and
amount of Sales and other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to
period depending upon the timing of divestitures, economic conditions, industry
consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.  There were no significant IP transactions in
the third quarter or first nine months of 2006 and 2005.

The increase in
Interest expense was primarily due to higher effective interest rates in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2006, compared with the same periods of
2005.
Interest expense
is presented as part of Cost of Global Financing in the Consolidated Statement
of Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global
Financing external business.  See page 70
for additional information regarding Global Financing debt and interest expense.
Retirement-Related
Benefits
The following
table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans.  Cost amounts are included as an addition to

Included in the
amounts above, the company had costs of approximately $311 million and  $262 million associated with its defined
benefit pension plans for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
comparable amount for the first nine months of 2006 and 2005 was costs of
approximately $985 million and $851 million, respectively.  These increases were primarily driven by the
recognition of previously deferred actuarial losses in accordance with SFAS 87,
Employers Accounting for Pensions. 
The third quarter 2006 year-to-year increase impacted gross profit by
approximately $55 million, RD&E expense by approximately $7 million and
SG&A expense by approximately $9 million. The nine months of 2006
year-to-year increase impacted gross profit 
by approximately $181 million and RD&E expense by approximately $24
million, while SG&A expense decreased by approximately $12 million and
Other (income) and expense declined by approximately $14 million.
Acquired Intangible Asset
Amortization
The
company has been investing in targeted acquisitions primarily within the
Software and Global Services segments to increase its capabilities in higher
value market segments.  As disclosed on
page 19, the number and the size of these acquisitions will increase in future
periods resulting in an increase in the amount of amortization of the acquired
intangible assets.  The following table

Provision for Income
Taxes
The effective tax
rates for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 were 30.0 percent and 48.0
percent, respectively. The corresponding effective tax rates for the first nine
months of 2006 and 2005 were 30.0 percent and 37.7 percent, respectively. The
decreases in the quarterly and nine months tax rates were primarily
attributable to the absence of the foreign earnings repatriation-related tax
charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005.
With limited
exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or
non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 1999.  The years subsequent to 1998 contain matters
that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and
regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and
tax credits.
44 



 
Although the outcome of
tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of
tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to
result for these years.
The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for
2001 through 2003 in the first quarter of 2005. The company is in preliminary
discussions with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of certain items, however,
no adjustments on these issues have been formally proposed by the IRS as of
September 30, 2006.  The company
anticipates that this audit will be substantially completed by the end of 2006.
While it is not yet possible to determine the impact of this audit on income
tax expense, the company does not anticipate having to make a significant cash
tax payment.
Earnings
Per Share
Basic earnings per
share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options, stock awards and convertible notes.

Global Services
revenue increased 2.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and 0.2 percent
(1 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2006, respectively, versus the same periods in 2005.  The growth rate in the third quarter improved
sequentially in both Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.
Global Technology
Services  (GTS) revenue increased 3.5
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and 1.1 percent
(2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months versus the same
periods of 2005, respectively. In the third quarter, GTS longer-term signings
were down 14 percent year-to-year while shorter-term signings increased 7
percent.
Strategic
Outsourcing revenue was up 5.7 percent as reported in the third quarter (4
percent adjusted for currency) and 1.8 percent (up 3 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first nine months versus the comparable prior year periods.
Strategic Outsourcing signings were down 29 percent year-to-year in the
quarter. For the third quarter, while total signings were down,  revenue growth improved due to signings
growth in 2005 and a continued focus on increasing services into existing
accounts.
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue decreased 1.6 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) and 4.4 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the same periods of 2005.  Over the last few quarters the company has
been implementing changes to improve the ITS business, including streamlining
offerings and aligning skills to address higher growth and higher value
areas.  While it has taken longer than
anticipated to show significant improvement, the third quarter demonstrated
progress.  In the third quarter, signings
were up 7 percent year-to-year  with
growth in Asia Pacific and Europe, the geographies where the transformational
changes were first implemented.
Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue was up 4.9 percent as  reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in
the third quarter and 20.6 percent as reported (22 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first nine months versus the same periods of 2005.  The rate of revenue growth in BTO continues
to be negatively impacted by a significant contract renegotiation which will
continue through the first quarter of 2007. 
BTO signings, however, were up 162 percent year-to-year in the third
quarter, with signings across key offering areas including Human Resources,
Finance and Accounting, Procurement and Supply Chain.
47 



 
The GTS segment
pre-tax profit margin for the third quarter was 9.6 percent, a decrease of  0.9 points year-to-year.  The company is continuing to invest in sales,
delivery and business development skills across the entire set of offerings, as
well as investing in SO infrastructure and BTO capabilities.
Global Business
Services (GBS) revenue increased 1.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency)
in the third quarter and decreased 1.5 percent (flat adjusted for currency) in
the  first nine months of 2006,
respectively, versus the same periods in 2005. The rate of growth in the
quarter improved sequentially. For the quarter, shorter-term signings increased
11 percent, driven by growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific,  and longer-term signings decreased 22
percent.
The company is
continuing to invest in high value-add Business Solutions. The company is
enhancing its Global Development Center capabilities in China and India to
leverage the recent Webify acquisition and to accelerate SOA within its
industry solutions.  Increased
investments in business development resources are being made to drive pipeline
and revenue growth in the Application Management Services business. The company
is also continuing to invest in key industry skills and solution specialists in
selected countries.
The GBS segment
third-quarter 2006 pre-tax profit margin improved 2.6 points year-to-year to
9.4 percent. Over the past 18 months the company has been implementing a
transformation of its operations to improve profitability. This transformation
included the restructuring actions taken in 2005, the deployment of global
resource management tools and end-to-end optimization of sourcing models, as
well as increased focus on deal selectivity. 
These actions have yielded consistent improvement in utilization, better
contract quality and increased profit margins.

gross profit dollars continued to increase primarily due to the benefits from
productivity initiatives and cost efficiencies, including improved
utilization.  Gross profit margins
improved in both the third quarter and first nine months across all Global
Services categories, except for BTO in the third quarter of 2006.  GBS
margins for the first nine months of 2006, although improved overall when
compared to 2005, were negatively impacted by increased delivery costs in Japan
on a select number of contracts.
Global Services Signings
Total signings for
Global Services  were $10.5 billion for
the third quarter of 2006.  Shorter-term
signings increased 9 percent versus the third quarter of 2005 and longer-term
signings were down 15 percent versus the third quarter of 2005.  In the third quarter of 2006, the company
signed 12 deals larger than $100 million and the companys total Global
Services backlog was estimated at $109 billion, flat versus June 30, 2006 and
down $2 billion from  December 31, 2005.

Longer-term contracts are generally 7 to 10 years in length and represent SO
and longer-term BTO contracts as well as GBS contracts with the U.S. Federal
government and its agencies and AMS for custom and legacy applications.  Shorter-term are contracts generally 3 to 9
months in length and represent the remaining GBS portfolio of  Consulting and Systems Integration, AMS
packaged applications and ITS contracts. 
These amounts have been adjusted to exclude the  impact of 
year-to-year currency changes.
Global Services
signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients
commitment under a Global Services contract. Signings are used by management to
assess period performance of Global Services management. There are no
third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management is an approximation of constant currency,
and involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients
commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence
of termination charges or wind-down costs. For example, for longer-term
contracts that require significant up front investment by the company, the
portions of these contracts that are counted as a signing are those periods in
which there is a significant economic impact on the client if the commitment is
not achieved, usually through a termination charge or the client incurring
significant
49 



 
wind-down costs as a
result of the termination. For shorter-term contracts that do not require
significant up front investments, a signing is usually equal to the full
contract value.
Signings include
SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are
treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value.  Maintenance is not included in signings as
maintenance contracts tend to be more steady-state, where revenues equal
renewals, and therefore, the company does not think they are as useful a
predictor of future performance.
Backlog includes
SO, BTO, ITS, GBS, and Maintenance. 
Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and
therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and
are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope
of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized
and currency assumptions used to approximate constant currency.
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincident to an acquisition.

Systems and
Technology Group revenue increased 9.6 percent (8 percent adjusted for
currency) and 5.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency)  in the third quarter and first nine months of
2006, respectively, versus the same periods in 2005.
System z revenue
increased 24.7 percent and 10.1 percent (22 percent and 10 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the third
quarter and first nine months of 2005, respectively.  MIPS (millions of instructions per second)
shipments increased 16 percent in the third quarter versus the third quarter of
2005 and reflects continued strong customer acceptance of both specialty
engines for Linux and Java workloads and traditional mainframe workloads.  The company at the end of the third quarter
had an installed inventory that has surpassed 10 million MIPS.  Systems z performance in the third quarter
also reflected good sales execution.
System i revenue
decreased 21.6 percent and 17.1 percent (23 percent and 17 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the same
periods in 2005, respectively.  The
company completed its transition to POWER5+ in the third quarter, however, the
current quarter compares to a strong third quarter of 2005 which had a 25
percent revenue growth.
System p revenue
increased 9.9 percent and declined 3.3 percent (up 8 percent and down 3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2005.  In the third quarter the company completed
its transition to POWER 5+ and expanded the implementation of POWER Quadcore
technology to all POWER-based entry level System p products.  These transitions allow the company to
sustain the price/performance and virtualization leadership position that has
made the company the number one UNIX vendor worldwide.
51 



 
System x revenue
increased 2.1 percent and increased 2.7 percent (1 percent and 3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2005.  System x server revenue increased 4.2 percent
and 4.6 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the
third quarter and first nine months of 2005. 
System x blades growth remained strong with revenue growth of 24.0
percent and 34.7 percent over last years levels in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2006.  IBM BladeCenter
offers clients unique power and cooling capabilities and the flexibility to
efficiently handle various workloads.  In
addition to the companys System x blades, the company offers POWER blades and
blades utilizing the Cell Broadband Engine. 
Total blade growth, including System p, was 31 percent in the third
quarter and 39 percent for the nine months period.
System Storage
revenue increased 11.8 percent and increased 4.9 percent (11 percent and
increased 5 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2006 versus the comparable periods in 2005.  Total disk revenue increased 13.9 percent and
6.0 percent, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006
versus the same periods in 2005. 
Midrange disk revenue increased 12.4 percent and 13.4 percent versus the
third quarter and first nine months of 2005 and enterprise disk revenue
increased 12.5  percent versus the third
quarter of 2005 and declined 5.0 percent for the first nine months of 2006 when
compared to the first nine months of 2005. 
The third-quarter enterprise disk revenue increase was primarily driven
by the  DS8000 family of products, with
almost 30 percent growth, as the company introduced POWER5+ technology to this
product.  Tape products revenue increased
8.0 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2006 versus the same periods of 2005. 
The company had good market acceptance of its new tape security offering
with unique encryption capabilities in the third quarter of 2006.
Microelectronics
revenue increased 28.8 percent and 36.3 percent, respectively, for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the comparable periods of
2005.  The increase in revenue was driven
by continued strong demand in the games processor business and networking
components.
Retail Stores
Solutions revenue increased primarily due to clients replacing their older point
of sale hardware and growth in the companys self service/kiosk solutions.  Printer Systems revenue decreased due
primarily to lower maintenance revenue as a result of a declining install base
and lower sales of hardware products.
Personal Computing
Division revenue decreased as a result of the company divesting its Personal
Computing business to Lenovo on April 30, 2005. 
The third quarter and first nine months of 2006 results do not have any
reported revenue versus 2005, which includes no revenue in the third  quarter and four months of revenue for the
first nine months.  (See Note 9 on page
19 for additional information).

The increases in
gross profit dollars for the third quarter of 2006 versus 2005 was primarily due
to revenue growth, particularly in the high margin System z servers.  The decrease in gross profit dollars for the
first nine months of 2006 versus 2005 was primarily due to the sale of the Personal
Computing business in the second quarter of 2005. This divestiture drove 5.3
points improvement in  the first nine
months of 2006 gross profit margin. The Personal Computing business had a lower
gross profit margin than the other hardware products.
Systems and
Technology Group gross profit margins declined for the third quarter and the
first nine months of 2006 (38.2 percent and 35.8 percent) versus the same
periods of 2005 (39.1 percent and 39.8 percent), respectively.  The third quarter gross profit margin
improved sequentially versus the first and second quarter, but declined year-to-year.  The decline in the third quarter gross profit
margin was driven by revenue mix towards the Microelectronics business, pricing
pressures in the mid-range and low-end servers, partially offset by strong
revenue growth and improved margins in System z mainframes and improved margins
in System Storage.
Differences
between the hardware segment gross margin and profit amounts above and the amounts
reported on page 39 (and derived from page one) primarily relate to the impact
of certain hedging transactions  (see
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions on page 72 of the IBM 2005 Annual
Report) as well as the ongoing warranty costs associated with the divested Personal
Computing business. The recorded amounts for such impact are considered
unallocated corporate amounts for purposes of measuring segment managements
gross margin performance and therefore are not included in the segment results
above.

Software revenue
increased 8.5 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) and 5.2  percent (6 percent adjusting for currency) in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, respectively, versus the same
periods of 2005.  This growth was driven
by the companys key branded middleware portfolio, as clients leverage the
companys end-to-end middleware capabilities.
The company has
been investing in its software business both internally and through targeted
acquisitions. Revenue performance during 2006 underscores that the companys
strategy is working.  An increasing
number of customers have embraced the companys integrated
54 



software portfolio.  This improves the clients efficiency and is
reflected in a number of large transactions completed in the third quarter. The
companys investments are also carrying it more deeply into targeted markets.
For example, the investments in Systems Management, including the acquisition
of Micromuse, have enabled the company to offer unique capabilities to its
communications clients, and contributed to Tivolis strong performance. In
addition, the companys advanced new technologies, such as Services Oriented
Architecture (SOA) and Information on Demand, are also being well received by
clients. These technologies form the underpinnings of more integrated
solutions, incorporating the companys software, services and hardware
capabilities.
Key Branded
Middleware is made up of five key brands which provide an integrated suite for
the companys customers. All five brands had growth in the third quarter with
double-digit growth in WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli.
The WebSphere
family of software revenue increased (29.7 percent and 24.1 percent) in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the third quarter and first
nine months of 2005, respectively. 
WebSphere provides the foundation for web-enabled applications and is a
key product set in deploying a clients SOA. 
In 2006, WebSphere technology has accelerated the emergence and
acceptance of SOA, contributing  to
double-digit revenue growth in WebSphere each quarter.
Information
Management software revenue increased (11.8 percent and 8.2 percent) in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2006 versus the same periods in 2005,
respectively. The companys Information on Demand portfolio builds value around
the companys core database business. 
These offerings grew over 50 percent year-to-year in the third quarter.
Tivoli software
revenue increased (44.3 percent and 26.9 percent) in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2006 versus the same periods in 2005, respectively.  The third quarter performance in Tivoli was
broad-based with greater than 35 percent growth in each of the three key Tivoli
segments: Systems Management, Security and Storage.
Lotus software
revenue increased (8.2 percent and 4.9 percent) in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2006 versus the same periods in 2005, respectively, benefiting
from continued momentum in its collaboration products and strong customer
loyalty.
Rational software
revenue increased (2.5 percent and 0.9 percent) in the third quarter and first nine
months versus the same periods in 2005, respectively.
Revenue from Other
Middleware products declined (0.7 percent and 1.8 percent) in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2006 when compared to the same periods in 2005,  espectively. 
Other Middleware includes more mature products which provide a stable
flow of revenue and profit.
Operating Systems
software revenue declined (6.1 percent and 7.9 percent) in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2006 versus the same periods in 2005.  The decline was due to improved price
performance in System z and volume declines in System i.
55 



Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM) software revenue increased 1.0 percent in the third quarter
and increased 8.7 percent in the first nine months of 2006 versus the same
periods in 2005, respectively. PLM software helps companies improve their
product development processes and their ability to use product-related
information across their business.

Software gross
profit dollars increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006
versus the same periods of 2005 driven primarily by  revenue growth.  Gross profit margins in both the third
quarter and first nine months were relatively flat when compared to the same
periods in 2005.
Overall, Software
revenue growth drove increased profit performance.  The Software segment pre-tax margin of 26.2
percent improved 1.4 points versus the third quarter of 2005.
Global Financing
See pages 64 and
65 for a discussion of Global Financings revenue and gross profit.
Results
of Discontinued Operations
There was no losses
from Discontinued Operations in the third quarter and first nine months of
2006, respectively, versus no losses and $27 million in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2005.  The 2005
charges were for additional costs associated with parts warranty as agreed upon
by the company and Hitachi Ltd., under the terms of the agreement for the sale
of the hard disk drive business to Hitachi Ltd. on December 31, 2002.

Financial Position
Dynamics
The assets and
debt associated with the companys Global Financing business are a significant
part of IBMs
financial position. Accordingly, although the financial position amounts
appearing on pages 3 and 4 are the companys consolidated amounts including
Global Financing, to the extent the Global Financing business is a major driver
of the Consolidated Financial Position, reference in the narrative section will
be made to a separate Global Financing section in this Management Discussion on
pages 64 to 71. The amounts appearing in the separate Global Financing section
are supplementary data presented to facilitate an understanding of the companys
Global Financing business.

Current assets
decreased $4,993 million due to declines of: $2,786 million in Cash and cash
equivalents and Marketable securities due to pension funding, share repurchase,
dividend payments, tax payments, and capital investments (see Cash Flow
analysis on page 58), and $1,746 million ($2,481 million excluding the positive
currency translation effect of $734 million) in short-term receivables mainly
due to collection of seasonally high year-end balances.
Current liabilities
decreased $223 million due to declines of: $487 million in Accounts payable and
$586 million in Taxes payable  both resulting from declines in these
balances from typically higher year-end levels; and $355 million in
infrastructure reduction accruals primarily driven by workforce reduction
payments in 2006 associated with the restructuring activities initiated in the
second quarter of 2005.  These declines
were partially offset by an increase of $1,339 million in short-term debt
primarily due to a reclass from long-term to short-term as the debt approaches
maturity.
57 



Cash Flow
The companys cash
flow from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 5, is summarized in the table below.
These amounts include the cash flows associated with the companys Global
Financing business.  See pages 64 to 71.

The increase in
net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2006 as
compared to the first nine months of 2005 was primarily driven by lower pension
funding of approximately $453 million ($1,676 million funding of non-U.S. plans
in 2006 versus $2,129 million funding in 2005 [U.S. PPP of $1,700 million and
non-U.S. plans of $429 million] ), growth in net income and continued focus on
working capital and supply chain management. 
This increase was partially offset by $1,780 million less cash provided
by Global Financing receivables due to growth in the third quarter and
increased tax payments of approximately $300 million year-to-date.
The increase in
net cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to net purchases
of marketable securities and other investments in 2006 of approximately $1.7
billion, compared to net proceeds of $0.7 billion in 2005.  This increase was primarily due to increased
investment in short-term marketable securities, and the $0.7 billion of net
cash received in 2005 as a result of the divestiture of the Personal Computing
business.
The increase in
net cash flows used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2006
compared with the same period of 2005 was primarily driven by lower proceeds
from new debt of approximately $3.9 billion, which was attributable to a
decrease in new debt issuances and $0.3 billion increase in cash dividends
paid. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 billion in net
payments to settle debt and short-term borrowings in 2006 versus 2005.

The increase in
Non-current assets was primarily due to an increase of $2,579 million ($535
million due to the effects of currency) in Prepaid pension assets driven by the
funding of the U.K. pension fund and an $896 million ($199 million due to
effects of currency) increase in goodwill which was primarily driven by the
Micromuse acquisition in the first quarter of 2006.
Long-term debt
decreased $1,988 million primarily due to a reclass to short-term debt as these
items approach maturity.  The company
continually monitors interest rates and manages its short-term and long-term
debt portfolios accordingly.
Non-current
liabilities (excluding debt) decreased $531 million primarily due to a decrease
of $767 million in Retirement and nonpension postretirement obligations driven
by the funding of the U.K. pension fund, offset by a $236 million increase in
Other liabilities driven by the effects of currency. 
Debt
The companys
funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to
manage the companys overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the
company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as
needed.

Stockholders Equity
Stockholders
equity increased $1,149 million from December 31, 2005, primarily due to an
increase in the companys retained earnings driven by net income and a
reduction of approximately $1.4 billion in the minimum pension liability due to
amendments made in certain non-U.S. plans that resulted in remeasurements;
partially offset by the companys ongoing stock repurchase program ($6,634
million) and higher dividend payments of $297 million in the first nine months
of 2006 versus the first nine months of 2005.
Looking
Forward
The following key
drivers impacting IBMs business are described in more detail in the 2005 IBM
Annual Report on page 21.
·                  Economic
environment and corporate spending budgets
·                  Internal
business transformation and global integration initiatives
·                  Innovation
initiatives
·                  Open standards
·                  Investing in
growth opportunities
The companys
balanced portfolio of businesses - hardware, software and services - is
designed to deliver the companys longer-term financial objective of
double-digit earnings per share growth. 
This portfolio generates a profit profile that is also relatively
balanced among the three major businesses. 
The business mix will vary by quarter, based on skew and other
factors.  The strength of the companys
business model is not in any single component - it is in the companys ability
to integrate across its portfolio on a global basis to create solutions for its
clients.  In addition, a key element of
the companys business model is its ability to deliver its objective of
earnings per share growth through a combination of revenue growth, productivity
and the effective use of cash.
In the third
quarter, the companys Global Services business increased its revenue growth
rate sequentially in both Global Technology Services and Global Business
Services.  Shorter-term signings
increased while longer-term signings were down versus the prior year.  Going forward, the company is focused on
converting its opportunity pipeline into longer-term signings growth.  In addition, the company is continuing to
focus on the actions it has implemented to improve its services business - the
third quarter demonstrated progress in this area.  The company has also made targeted
investments, both in GTS and GBS.  These
investments are designed to drive revenue growth and continued productivity improvements
over time.
Within its Systems
and Technology business, the company completed key product transitions in its
server and storage brands in the third quarter. 
This contributed to improved performance led by System p and System Storage
as well as strong growth in System z and System x blades.  The company will continue to focus on the
value that its leading technologies, such as POWER5+, can bring to developing
innovative solutions for clients.  In
addition, while the company expects continued strong demand for its
Microelectronics business, the company also expects the revenue growth rate in
the fourth quarter will moderate after growing over 25 percent for four
consecutive quarters.
60 



Within Software,
the company expects its Key Branded Middleware products to continue to benefit
from its internal development investments, targeted acquisition strategy and
continued market opportunity for the companys product offerings, including its
focus on key emerging trends such as Services Oriented Architecture and
Information on Demand.  The company will
increase its software portfolio in the fourth quarter by beginning the
integration of key acquisitions such as MRO Software Inc., and FileNet
Corporation.
The amount of IP
and custom development income has been declining in recent years and decreased
in the first nine months of 2006.  The
overall declining trend may continue as the company does not expect IP and
custom development income to be a contributor to growth in earnings.
Total
Retirement-related benefits expense increased in the first nine months of 2006,
as compared with the first nine months of 
2005, by $177 million as discussed on pages 43 and 44.  For the full year, the company estimates
pre-tax retirement-related plan expense to be approximately flat  when compared to 2005.  This is less then the previously estimated
range of a $100 - $200 million increase discussed on page 37 of the companys
2005 Annual Report.  The change in
projected expense is due to reductions in the companys non-U.S. pension plans.  Excluding effects of one-time charges
incurred in 2005 for pension curtailment ($267 million) and charges related to
the second quarter 2005 restructuring actions ($65 million), the expected
year-to-year impact on retirement-related plan expense is an increase of
approximately $300 million.
In the normal
course of business, the company expects that its effective tax rate will
approximate 30 percent. The rate will change year-to-year based on nonrecurring
events (such as the third-quarter 2005 tax charge associated with the
repatriation of $9.5 billion under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004) as
well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes,
the timing and amount of foreign dividends, state and local taxes, and the interaction
of various global tax strategies.
In 2005, the
companys cash tax rate declined slightly to 16 percent from 17 percent in
2004.  The companys cash tax rate
represents the amount of income taxes paid during the year over Income from
continuing operations before income taxes. 
It is expected that the companys cash tax rate will increase in 2006 to
approximately 20 percent, primarily as a result of the utilization of its U.S.
Federal alternative minimum tax credits. 
The company anticipates that its cash tax rate will approximate 22
percent in the near term.
Currency Rate
Fluctuations
Changes in the
relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys
results.  At September 30, 2006, currency
changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies
being translated into more U.S. dollars than at year-end 2005. The company uses
a variety of financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks
related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based
transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears in the 2005
IBM Annual Report in note L, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on pages   71
to 74.
61 



The company earned
over 60 percent of its net income in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in
the first nine months of 2006.  In
general, these currencies were weaker against the U.S. dollar during the first
nine months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005, resulting in 2006
foreign currency earnings translated into fewer dollars than they would have in
the first nine months of 2005.  The
company maintains hedging programs to limit the volatility of currency impacts
on its financial results.  These hedging
programs limit the impact of currency changes on the companys financial
results but do not eliminate them.  In
addition to the translation of earnings and the companys hedging programs, the
impact of currency may also affect the companys pricing and sourcing actions,
although the impact of these actions on net income is difficult to track and
quantify.  For these reasons, the company
believes that extended periods of dollar weakness are positive for net income
and extended periods of dollar strength are negative, although the precise
impact is difficult to assess.
For non-U.S.
subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic
environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in
results of operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by
linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and by entering into foreign
currency hedge contracts.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
On pages 38 and 39
of the companys 2005 Annual Report, there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data.  One table, on page 38, includes each of the
past five years of the companys Net cash from operating activities, Cash and
marketable securities, the size of the companys global credit facilities and
committed trade receivables securitization facility.  For the nine months ended or as of, as
applicable, September 30, 2006, those amounts are $9.7 billion, $10.9 billion,
$10.0 billion and $0.0 billion, respectively.
On July 28, 2006,
the company terminated its committed trade receivables securitization
facility.  This facility was initially
established in July, 2004 and provided the company with securitization
capability up to $0.5 billion.  The
facility was terminated as management determined that the company has
sufficient liquidity and alternative funding resources.
On June 28, 2006,
the company entered into a new 5-year $10,000,000,000 Credit Agreement (the Credit
Agreement).  The Credit Agreement
replaces the companys existing 5-year $10,000,000,000 Credit Agreement (the Existing
Credit Agreement) dated May 27, 2004. 
The Existing Credit Agreement was not otherwise due to expire until May
27, 2009.
The Credit
Agreement permits the company and its Subsidiary Borrowers to borrow up to $10
billion on a revolving basis.  Borrowings
of the Subsidiary Borrowers will be unconditionally guaranteed by the
company.  The company may also, upon the
agreement of either the then existing Lenders, or of additional banks not
currently party to the Credit agreement, increase the commitments under the
Credit Agreement up to an additional $2.0 billion. Subject to certain
conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the company and Subsidiary Borrowers
may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Agreement at any time
during the term of the Credit Agreement. Funds borrowed may be used for the
general corporate
62 



purposes of the company and its subsidiaries,
including the support of outstanding commercial paper issuances of the company
and its subsidiaries.  The Credit
Agreement terminates on June 28, 2011. 
Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be based on
prevailing market interest rates, as further described in the Credit
Agreement.  The Credit Agreement contains
customary representations and warranties, covenants, events of default, and
indemnification provisions.
The major rating
agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at September 30, 2006 appear
in the table below and remain unchanged from December 31, 2005.  The company has no contractual arrangements
that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material
adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

The second table,
appearing on page 39 of the 2005 IBM Annual Report, presents the way in which
management reviews its cash flows for each of the past five years and is
accompanied by a description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and
reviewed.  While the company prepares its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement
of Cash Flows, on page 5 of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events
underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 58 of this Form
10-Q, the following is the management view of cash flows for the first nine
months of 2006 and 2005 prepared in a manner consistent with the table on page

As discussed in Note 8 on
page 19 of this Form 10-Q, the company will expend between $3.7 - $4.2 billion
on strategic acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Given the companys strong cash balance and
seasonally strong cash from operations in the fourth quarter, these investments
will not materially impact the companys liquidity position.
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include
significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic
sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension
funding requirements during periods of severe and prolonged downturns in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 12 on
pages 21 to 25 of this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company
is not quantifying any impact from pension funding because it is not possible
to predict future movements in the capital markets.
Actual return on the PPP
plan assets for the first nine months of 2006 was 9.35 percent.  If the full year actual return on plan assets
for the PPP was less than 2.3 percent, the PPPs accumulated benefit obligation
would be greater than its plan assets (assuming no other assumption
changes).  As discussed on pages 87 of
IBMs 2005 Annual Report, such a situation may result in a voluntary
contribution of cash or stock to the PPP.
Global
Financing
Global Financing is a
business segment within IBM
that is measured as if it were a standalone entity. Accordingly, the
information presented in this section is consistent with this separate company
view.

Global Financing revenue
increased 4.0 percent in the third quarter of 2006 versus the same period in
2005.  External revenue decreased 2.1
percent (3.7 percent adjusted for currency) driven by external used equipment
sales of $137 million in 2006 versus $170 million in 2005, partially offset by
increased financing revenue of $450 million in 2006 versus $428 million in
64 



 
2005.  Internal revenue increased 16.7 percent
driven by internal used equipment sales of $187 million versus $162 million in
the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 15.3 percent due primarily to higher
sales to the Hardware segment, and financing revenue of $150 million in 2006
versus $127 million in 2005 due primarily to an increase in the average internal
asset balance.
Global Financing revenue
decreased 1.0 percent in the first nine months of 2006 versus the same period
in 2005.  External revenue decreased 3.0
percent (2.6 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by external used
equipment sales of $439 million in 2006 versus $499 million in 2005, partially
offset by improved financing revenue of $1,305 million in 2006 versus $1,298
million in 2005, an increase of 0.5 percent. 
Internal revenue increased 2.6 percent driven by financing revenue of $434
million in the first nine months of 2006 versus $415 million in the same period
in 2005, an increase of 4.7 percent.
Global Financing gross
profit dollars decreased $46 million or 8.7 percent for the third quarter and
decreased $39 million or 2.5 percent in the first nine months of 2006
when compared to the same periods last year. 
For the third quarter of 2006, the decrease in gross profit dollars was
primarily driven by higher borrowing costs and lower equipment sales gross
profit, partially offset by the increase in financing revenue discussed
above.  The decrease in gross profit
margin was driven by lower financing margins due to higher borrowing costs and
a decrease in equipment sales margins. 
For the first nine months of 2006, the decrease in gross profit dollars
was driven by higher borrowing costs, partially offset by higher equipment
sales gross profit of $398 million in 2006 versus $345 million in
2005, an increase of 15.4 percent, and the increase in financing revenue
discussed above.  The decrease in gross
profit margin is driven by lower financing margins due to higher borrowing
costs, partially offset by an improvement in equipment sales margins.
Global Financing pre-tax
income decreased 7.9 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2006, when compared to the same periods last
year.  The decrease in the third quarter
was driven by the decrease in gross profit of $46 million discussed above.  The decrease in the first nine months of 2006
is primarily due to the decrease in gross profit of $39 million also discussed
above.
The decrease in
return-on-equity in the third quarter of 2006 versus the third quarter of 2005,
and for the first nine months of 2006 compared to the first nine months of 2005
was primarily due to lower earnings.

(a)             Amounts eliminated
for purposes of IBMs consolidated results and therefore do not appear on pages
3 and 4.
(b)            These assets, along
with all other financing assets in this table, are leveraged using Global
Financing debt.
(c)             Global
Financing debt includes debt of the company and of the Global Financing units
that support the Global Financing business.
Sources and Uses
of Funds
The primary use of funds
in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets.
Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware, software and services,
but also include non-IBM
equipment, software and services to meet IBM
clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for equipment as well as
loans for hardware, software and services with terms generally for two to seven
years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services
and are unsecured.  These loans are
subjected to additional credit analysis in order to mitigate the associated
risk.  Client financing also includes
internal activity as described on page 43 of the 2005 IBM Annual Report.
Commercial financing
originations arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing
for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM
products. Payment terms for inventory financing generally range from 30 to 90
days. Payment terms for accounts receivable financing generally range from 30
to 90 days.

Total new originations
exceeded cash collections of client and commercial financing assets in the
third quarter of 2006, which resulted in a net increase in financing assets of
$306 million in this period versus June 30, 2006. The increase in originations
was mainly due to improving volumes in client financing.  Cash collections of both customer and
commercial financing assets exceeded new financing originations in the first
nine months of 2006, which resulted in a net decline in financing assets from December
31, 2005.
Cash generated by Global
Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and dividends
to IBM.

*                    Represents
reserved receivables, net of recoveries, that were disposed of during the
period.
**             Primarily
represents currency translation adjustments.
The percentage of
financing receivables reserved decreased from 2.2 percent at December 31, 2005
to 1.8 percent at September 30, 2006 due to the disposition of previously
reserved receivables combined with lower requirements for additional
reserves.  Unallocated reserves decreased
29 percent from $84 million at December 31, 2005 to $60 million at September
30, 2006.  The decrease in unallocated
reserves is due to improved economic conditions and improved credit quality of
the portfolio, as well as the decline in gross financing receivables.  Specific reserves decreased 24 percent from
$421 million to $319 million in 2006. 
The decrease in specific reserves was due to the disposition of reserved
receivables during the period combined with lower requirements for additional
specific reserves.
Global Financings bad
debt expense was a reduction of $27 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2006, compared with a reduction of $48 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005.  The continued
reduction in bad debt expense was primarily attributed to the overall decline
in the financing asset portfolio, as well as the improvement in economic
conditions and the improved credit quality of the portfolio in the first nine
months of 2006.
68 



 
Residual Value
Residual value is a risk
unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon
the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease
inception.  Global Financing has insight
into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them to the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
Global Financing
optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of
lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements
with current clients.  Sales of equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at end of lease, represented 35.0 percent and
37.5 percent of Global Financings revenue in the third quarter and first nine
months, respectively, of 2006 and 37.4 percent and 39.1 percent in the third
quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2005.  The decrease in the third quarter of 2006 was
driven by the improvement in financing revenue and the decrease for the first
nine months of 2006 was driven by a decline in external used equipment
sales.  The gross margins on these sales
were 32.6 percent and 40.8 percent in the third quarter of 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and the gross margins were 38.1 percent and 31.4 percent for the
first nine months of 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The decrease in gross margin in the third
quarter of 2006 from the third quarter of 2005 was primarily due to a lower
margin on internal equipment sales.  The
increase in gross margin in the first nine months of 2006 from the first nine
months of 2005 was largely due to prior year early terminations of internal
leases and the subsequent sale of equipment to Global Services, which carried a
low gross profit margin.
The following table
presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and
operating leases at December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2006 for consolidated
IBM.  In addition, the table presents the
residual value as a percentage of the original amount financed and a run out of
the unguaranteed residual value over the remaining lives of these leases as of
September 30, 2006.  In addition to the
unguaranteed residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will
obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment scheduled to be returned
at end of lease. These third-party guarantees are included in lease payments as
provided for by accounting standards in the determination of lease
classifications for the covered equipment and provide protection against risk
of loss arising from declines in equipment values for these assets. The
residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized
in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease or operating
lease.  The aggregate asset values
associated with the guarantees were $204 million and $110 million for the
financing transactions originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2006
and September 30, 2005, respectively, and $447 million and $351 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.  The associated aggregate guaranteed future
values at the scheduled end of lease were $10 million and $4 million for the
financing transactions originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2006
and September 30, 2005, respectively, and $19 million and $13 million for the
financing transactions originated during the nine months ended September 30,
2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. 
The cost of guarantees was $1.4 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2006 and $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and $3.3
million and $4.9 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2006
and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Global Financing funds its
operations primarily through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of
approximately 7 to 1.  The debt is used
to fund Global Financing assets. The debt is composed of intercompany loans and
external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to
substantially match the term and currency underlying the receivable. The
intercompany loans are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 66.
The companys Global
Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys external
clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company
(internal).  As previously stated, the company manages and measures Global Financing as if it were a
standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting
Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global
Financing Results of Operations on page 64 and in Segment Information on pages
81 through 84.
In the companys
Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page one, however, the interest expense
supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified
from Cost of Financing to Interest Expense.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
Global Financing is a
segment of the company and as such is supported by the companys liquidity
position and access to capital markets. Cash generated from operations was
deployed to reduce debt and pay dividends to the company in order to maintain
an appropriate debt to equity ratio.

Looking Forward
Given Global Financings
mission of supporting IBMs hardware, software, and services businesses,
originations for both client and commercial finance businesses will be
dependent upon the overall demand for IT hardware, software, and services, as
well as client participation rates.
As a result of the
company divesting its Personal Computing business to Lenovo in the second
quarter of 2005, Global Financing will support Lenovos PC business through an
exclusive, five year agreement covering all Global Financing lines of business
effective May 1, 2005.  These financings
with Lenovo are external revenue to Global Financing.
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing funding strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.  The companys policy of matching asset and
liability positions in foreign currencies will limit the impacts of currency
fluctuations.
The economy could impact
the credit quality of the Global Financing receivable portfolio and therefore the
level of provision for bad debt. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
As discussed above,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk
through both insight into the product cycles as well as through its remarketing
business.
Global Financing has
policies in place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These
policies, combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the
prudent management of the business going forward, even during periods of
economic uncertainty.
