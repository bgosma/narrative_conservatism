Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation:
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of the
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM and/or the company) have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are
unaudited. In the opinion of the companys management, these statements include
all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a
fair statement of the companys results of operations, financial position and
cash flows.
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue,
costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are
reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
Actual results may be different. See the companys 2009 Annual Report on pages 52
to 54 for a discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the companys 2009 Annual Report.
 
Noncontrolling
interest amounts in income of $2 million, net of tax, for the three months
ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009, respectively, are not
presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings due to
immateriality, but are reflected within the other (income) and expense line
item. Additionally, changes to noncontrolling interests are presented in Note
10, Equity Activity, on page 25.
 
Within
the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the
use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are
calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is
annotated where applicable.
 
2. Accounting Changes: In January 2010, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued additional disclosure requirements for
fair value measurements. The guidance requires previous fair value hierarchy
disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities. A
class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the
statement of financial position. In addition, significant transfers between
Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy are required to be disclosed. These
additional requirements became effective January 1, 2010 for quarterly and
annual reporting. These amendments did not have an impact on the consolidated
financial results as this guidance relates only to additional disclosures. See
Note 4, Fair Value, on pages 11 to 13 for further information. In
addition, the fair value disclosure amendments also require more detailed
disclosures of the changes in Level 3 instruments. These changes will be
effective January 1, 2011 and are not expected to have an impact on the
consolidated financial results as this guidance only relates to additional
disclosures.
 
In October 2009, the
FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple
deliverables. The new guidance requires the use of managements best estimate
of selling price (BESP) for the deliverables in an arrangement when vendor
specific objective evidence (VSOE), vendor objective evidence (VOE) or third
party evidence (TPE) of the selling price is not available. In addition,
excluding specific software revenue guidance, the residual method of allocating
arrangement consideration is no longer permitted, and an entity is required to
allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. In
accordance with the guidance, the company has elected to early adopt its
provisions as of January 1, 2010 on a prospective basis for all new or
materially modified arrangements entered into on or after that date. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
Also, in October 2009,
the FASB issued guidance which amended the scope of existing software revenue
recognition guidance. Tangible products containing software components and
non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible products
essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue
guidance and are accounted for based on other applicable revenue recognition
guidance. In addition, the amendments require that hardware components of a
tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the
software revenue guidance. This guidance must be adopted in the same period
that the company adopts the amended guidance for arrangements with multiple
deliverables described in the preceding paragraph. Therefore, the company
elected to early adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2010 on a
prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into
on or after that date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
See Note 3, Revenue
Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, on pages 8 to 11
for the required disclosures and other information related to the adoption of
these accounting standards.

Table of Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
In June 2009, the
FASB issued amendments to the accounting rules for variable interest
entities (VIEs). The new guidance eliminates the quantitative approach
previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable
interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary. The company adopted these amendments for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2010. The
adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
3.
Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables: As discussed in Note 2, Accounting
Changes, on page 7, effective January 1, 2010 the company adopted on
a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered
into on or after that date the amended accounting guidance for
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and the amended guidance related to
the scope of existing software revenue recognition guidance. The amended
guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for the companys
revenue transactions. Most of the companys products and services qualify as
separate units of accounting.
 
The company enters into
revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of its products
and services based on the needs of its clients. These arrangements may include
any combination of services, software, hardware and/or financing. For example,
a client may purchase a server that includes operating system software. In
addition, the arrangement may include post-contract support for the software
and a contract for post-warranty maintenance service for the hardware. These
types of arrangements can also include financing provided by the company. These
arrangements consist of multiple deliverables, with the hardware and software
delivered in one reporting period and the software support and hardware
maintenance services delivered across multiple reporting periods. In another
example, a client may outsource the running of its datacenter operations to the
company on a long term, multiple year basis and periodically purchase servers
and/or software products from the company to upgrade or expand its facility.
The outsourcing services are provided on a continuous basis across multiple
reporting periods and the hardware and software products are delivered in one
reporting period. To the extent that a deliverable in a multiple-deliverable
arrangement is subject to specific guidance that deliverable is accounted for
in accordance with such specific guidance. Examples of such arrangements may
include leased hardware which is subject to specific leasing guidance or
software which is subject to specific software revenue recognition guidance on
whether and/or how to separate multiple deliverable arrangements into separate
units of accounting (separability) and how to allocate the arrangement
consideration among those separate units of accounting (allocation). For all
other deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements, the guidance below is
applied for separability and allocation. A multiple-deliverable arrangement is
separated into more than one unit of accounting if the following criteria are
met:
 
·                  The delivered item(s) has value to
the client on a stand-alone basis; and
·                  If the arrangement includes a general
right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of
the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control
of the company.
 
If these criteria are not met, the arrangement is
accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being
recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier
of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is
delivered. If these criteria are met for each element and there is a relative
selling price for all units of accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement
consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each
units relative selling price. The revenue recognition policies described below
are then applied to each unit of accounting, as applicable.
 
Services
 
The
companys primary services offerings include information technology (IT)
datacenter and business process outsourcing, application management services,
consulting and systems integration, technology infrastructure and system
maintenance, Web hosting and the design and development of complex IT systems
to a clients specifications (design and build). These services are provided on
a time-and-material basis, as a fixed-price contract or as a fixed-price per
measure of output contract and the contract terms range from less than one year
to over 10 years.
 
Revenue
from IT datacenter and business process outsourcing contracts is recognized in
the period the services are provided using either an objective measure of
output or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Under the
output method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on the services
delivered in the period.
 
Revenue
from application management services, technology infrastructure and system
maintenance and Web hosting contracts is primarily recognized on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the contracts. Revenue from
time-and-material

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
contracts is recognized
as labor hours are delivered and direct expenses are incurred. Revenue related
to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the delivery period.
 
Revenue
from fixed-price design and build contracts is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion (POC) method.  Under the POC method, revenue
is recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the
total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract. If circumstances arise
that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress
toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may
result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such
revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that
gave rise to the revision become known by management.
 
Hardware
 
The companys hardware offerings include the sale or
lease of system servers, storage solutions, retail store systems and the sale
of semiconductor design and manufacturing services. The company provides
warranties for its hardware products that range up to three years, with the
majority being either one year or three years. The company also offers
installation services for its more complex products.
 
Revenue from hardware sales and sales-type leases is
recognized when risk of loss has transferred to the client and there are no
unfulfilled company obligations that affect the clients final acceptance of
the arrangement. Any cost of standard warranties and remaining obligations that
are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue
is recognized. Revenue from extended warranty contracts, for which the company
is obligated to perform, is recorded as deferred income and subsequently
recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period. Revenue from
rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the rental or lease.
 
Software
 
Revenue from perpetual (one-time charge) license
software is recognized at the inception of the license term if all revenue
recognition criteria have been met. Revenue from term (recurring license
charge) license software is recognized on a subscription basis over the period
that the client is entitled to use the license. Revenue from subscription and
support, which includes unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period such items are
delivered. In multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements that include software
that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole (software
multiple-deliverable arrangements), software and software-related elements are
accounted for in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance.
Software-related elements include software products and services for which a
software deliverable is essential to its functionality. Tangible products
containing software components and non-software components that function
together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no
longer within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and are
accounted for based on other applicable revenue recognition guidance.
 
A software multiple-deliverable arrangement is
separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following
criteria are met:
 
·                  The functionality of the delivered
element(s) is not dependent on the undelivered element(s);
 
·                  There is VSOE of fair value of the
undelivered element(s). VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when
the deliverable is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and not as
part of the multiple-deliverable arrangement; and
 
·                  Delivery of the delivered element(s) represents
the culmination of the earnings process for that element(s).
 
If any
one of these criteria are not met, the arrangement is accounted for as one unit
of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized on a straight-line
basis or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when
the last undelivered element is delivered. If these criteria are met for each
element and there is VSOE of fair value for all units of accounting in an
arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units
of accounting based on each units relative VSOE of fair value. There may be
cases, however, in which there is VSOE of fair value of the undelivered item(s) but
no such evidence for the delivered item(s). In these cases, the residual method
is used to allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual method,
the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item(s) equals the
total arrangement consideration less the aggregate VSOE of fair value of the
undelivered elements.

The companys multiple-deliverable arrangements may
have a stand-alone software deliverable that is subject to the existing
software revenue recognition guidance. The revenue for these multiple
deliverable arrangements is allocated to the software deliverable and the
non-software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the
deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy (VSOE,TPE or BESP) in the
new amended revenue accounting guidance. In the limited circumstances where the
company cannot determine VSOE or TPE of the selling price for all of the
deliverables in the arrangement, including the software deliverable, BESP is
used for the purposes of performing this allocation.
 
Financing
 
Financing income attributable to sales-type leases,
direct financing leases and loans is recognized on the accrual basis using the
effective interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 
Determination of Best Estimate of Selling Price
 
In certain limited instances, the company is not able
to establish VSOE for all elements in a multiple deliverable arrangement. When
VSOE cannot be established, the company attempts to establish the selling price
of each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for
similar deliverables when sold separately.
 
When the company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE,
the company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement consideration. The
objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the company would transact
a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Due to the
fact that the company sells its products and services on a stand-alone basis,
and therefore has established VSOE for its products and services offerings, the
company expects to use BESP to determine the relative selling price for a
product or service in a multiple-deliverable arrangement on an infrequent
basis. An example of when BESP would be used is when the company sells a new
product, for which VSOE and TPE does not exist, in a multiple deliverable
arrangement prior to selling the new product on a stand-alone basis. During the
first quarter of 2010, BESP was used in two transactions and the effects of its
use were immaterial.
 
The company determines BESP for a product or service
by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, overall market
conditions, including geographic or regional specific market factors,
competitive positioning, competitor actions, internal costs, profit objectives
and pricing practices. The determination of BESP is a formal process within the
company that includes review and approval by the companys management. In
addition, the company regularly reviews VSOE and TPE for its products and
services, in addition to BESP.
 
Effect of Adoption
 
For transactions entered into prior to January 1,
2010, the company recognized revenue based on established revenue recognition
guidance as it related to the elements within the arrangement. For the vast
majority of the companys arrangements involving multiple deliverables, the fee
from the arrangement was allocated to each respective element based on its
relative fair value, using VSOE. In the limited circumstances when the company
was not able to determine VSOE for all of the elements of the arrangement, but
was able to obtain VSOE for any undelivered elements, revenue was allocated
using the residual method. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue
allocated to delivered elements equaled the total arrangement consideration
less the aggregate selling price of any undelivered elements, and no revenue
was recognized until all elements without VSOE had been delivered. If VSOE of
any undelivered items did not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement was
initially deferred and recognized at the earlier of: (i) delivery of those
elements for which VSOE did not exist or (ii) when VSOE was established.
The residual method and recognition of revenue on a ratable basis were
generally used in circumstances where VSOE, as applicable, was unavailable.
 
The new amended accounting standards for
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and changes to the scope of existing
software revenue recognition guidance if applied to transactions in the year
ended December 31, 2009 would not have resulted in a material change to
the companys reported revenue for that fiscal year period.
 
In addition, there would not have been a material
impact to revenue, as reported during the quarter ended March 31, 2010, if
the transactions entered into or materially modified on or after January 1,
2010 were subject to the previous accounting guidance.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
As discussed in Note 2, Accounting Changes, there
was no material impact in the quarter ended March 31, 2010 from the
adoption of the amended revenue guidance. In terms of the timing and pattern of
revenue recognition, the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition is not
expected to have a material impact on revenue in periods after the initial
adoption.
 
See the companys 2009
Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 70 and
71 and Critical Accounting Estimates, on pages 52 and 53 for additional
information.
 
4. Fair Value: Exit prices
are used to measure assets and liabilities that fall within the scope of the
fair value measurements guidance. Under this guidance, the company is required
to classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
· Level 1Quoted
prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement
date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
· Level 2Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active,
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial
instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or
indirectly; and
· Level 3Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value
measurement and unobservable.
 
The
guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available
without undue cost and effort.
 
When
available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair
value and classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
The
determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate
yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For
derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow
analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
In
determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers
certain market valuation adjustments to the base valuations calculated using
the methodologies described below for several parameters that market
participants would consider in determining fair value:
 
·      Counterparty
credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into
account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit
default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·      Credit risk
adjustments are applied to reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing
all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates
the companys own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
As
an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived by a discounted cash flow
model using observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts,
yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These
inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which
are available for the full term of the derivative.
 
Certain
financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These
assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair value at
the end of the period to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
These assets include public cost method investments that are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary
impairment of a financial investment, fair value is measured using a  model described above.
 
Non-financial
assets such as property plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible
assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are
deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets
depend on the type of asset. See Note A in the 2009 Annual Report for further
information. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the
quarters ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009.

5. Financial
Instruments (excluding derivatives): Cash and cash equivalents, debt and marketable equity
securities are recognized and measured at fair value in the companys
consolidated financial statements. Notes and other accounts receivable and
other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate
fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt are
financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. In the
absence of quoted prices in active markets, considerable judgment is required
in developing estimates of fair value. Estimates are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts the company could realize in a current market transaction. The
following methods and assumptions are used to estimate fair values:
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
Estimates
of fair value are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest
rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the
same remaining maturities.
 
Long-term Debt
 
Fair
value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for
the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other
long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected
present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair
value. The carrying amount of long-term debt is $21,305 million and $21,932
million and the estimated fair value is $22,261 million and $23,748 million at March 31,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Based on an evaluation of
available evidence as of March 31, 2010, the company believes that
unrealized losses on debt and marketable equity securities are temporary and do
not represent a need for an other-than-temporary impairment.
 
Proceeds from sales of
debt securities and marketable equity securities were approximately $9 million
and $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The gross realized  gains
(before taxes) on these sales totaled $4 million for the three months ended March 31,
2010. The gross realized losses (before taxes) on these sales totaled $9
million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The company determines
the cost of the securities sold based on the specific identification method.
 
The after tax net
unrealized holding gains/(losses) on available-for-sale debt and marketable
equity securities that have been included in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) and the after tax net gains/(losses) reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into net income were as follows:

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases is for leases that
relate principally to the companys systems products and are for terms ranging
from two to six years. Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases
includes unguaranteed residual values of $815 million and $849 million at March 31,
2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned
income of $842 million and $905 million and of allowance for doubtful accounts
receivable of $158 million and $159 million at those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables are loans that are provided by Global Financing
primarily to clients to finance the purchase of 
software and services. Separate contractual relationships on these
financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally from two to seven years.
Each financing contract is priced independently at competitive market rates.
The company has a history of enforcing the terms of these separate financing
agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $258 million and $271 million at March 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively.
 
The company did not have any financing
receivables held for sale as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
 
7. Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions: The
company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender
and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the
company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and
client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and,
where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are
denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align
rate movements between the interest rates associated with the companys lease
and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing
debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the
company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will
fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit
risk, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully
selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other
factors. The companys established policies and procedures for mitigating
credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits
for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of
counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these
arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the
 
16

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
arrangement to net amounts due to and from the
counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of
counterparty default. The company is
also a party to collateral security arrangements with certain
counterparties.  These arrangements
require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities)
when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds.
Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap
pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The
aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized
arrangements that were in a liability position at March 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009 was $245 million and $779 million, respectively, for which the company has
posted collateral of $0.2 million and $37 million, respectively. Full overnight
collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event that the
companys credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default
swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of
the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in
net asset positions as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was
$1,130 million and $838 million, respectively. This amount represents the maximum
exposure to loss at the reporting date as a result of the counterparties
failing to perform as contracted. This exposure is reduced by $472 million and
$573 million at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively,
of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those
counterparties.  The company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master
netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon
payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related
derivative instruments. At March 31, 2010, the amount recognized in other
receivables for the right to reclaim cash collateral totaled $0.2 million. At December 31,
2009, $37 million was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets for
the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amounts recognized in accounts
payable for the obligation to return cash collateral totaled $75 million at March 31,
2010. The company had no obligation to return cash collateral at December 31,
2009. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to
rehypothecation and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. At March 31,
2010, $0.2 million was rehypothecated.
 
The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge
the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency
exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect
to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges,
expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash
flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the
translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors the cash loss
potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging
relationships by de-designating the derivative instrument to manage this
liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may
utilize derivatives to offset the changes in fair value of the de-designated
instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity. The company
expended $27 million and $144 million, respectively, related to maturities of
derivative instruments that existed in qualifying net investment hedge
relationships in the three months ending March 31, 2010 and March 31,
2009. At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the company had assets
of $152 million and $84 million, respectively, representing the fair value of
derivative instruments in qualifying net investment hedge relationships. The
weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at March 31, 2010
and December 31, 2009 was approximately 0.8 years and 1.6 years,
respectively. In addition, at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
the company had liabilities of $290 million and $318 million, respectively,
representing the fair value of derivative instruments that were previously
designated in qualifying net investment hedging relationships but were
de-designated prior to March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009,
respectively; of these amounts $120 million and $94 million are expected to
mature over the next twelve months, respectively. The notional amount of these
instruments at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was $2.1 billion
and $2.3 billion, respectively, including original and offsetting transactions.
 
In its hedging programs,
the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and
cross-currency swaps, depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is
not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
 
A brief description of
the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings
 
The company issues debt
in the global capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan
portfolio. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate
mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce
overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges). At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total
notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps was $7.6 billion and $9.1
billion, respectively.
 
17





Table of
Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to
interest rate volatility on forecasted debt issuances. To manage this risk, the
company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the
interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at March 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net
Investment)
 
A significant portion of
the companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a
hedge of net investment to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of
major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also
uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk
management purpose. At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment
hedges was $2.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
The companys operations
generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these
foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency
markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to
manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years.
At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total notional amount of
forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost
transactions was $17.7 billion and $18.7 billion, with a weighted-average
remaining maturity of 1.2 years and 1.3 years, respectively.
 
Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign
currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional
currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years.
At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total notional amount of
cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency
denominated debt was $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency
Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its
Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally
use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In
addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically
hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the
companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these
forward and swap contracts are generally less than two years. The changes in
the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are
generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of
foreign currency exposure was $12.7 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively.

Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to
market price changes primarily related to certain obligations to employees.
These exposures are primarily related to market price movements in certain
broad equity market indices and in the companys own stock. Changes in the
overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in
selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the
company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically
hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The
derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or
the total return on the companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value
with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the
total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these
compensation obligations was $0.8 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
The company holds
warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various
investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net
cash settlement provisions. The amount of shares to be purchased under these
agreements was immaterial at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in other
(income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The company is exposed to
a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms.
The company utilizes credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit
exposures. These derivatives have terms of one year or less. The swaps are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any
derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at March 31,
2010 and December 31, 2009.
 
The following tables provide
a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument related
risk management activity as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009
as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively:

(1) See
Note 7 for additional information on the companys purpose for entering into
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and its overall risk
management strategies.
(2) The
amount includes changes in clean fair values of the derivative instruments in
fair value hedging relationships and the periodic accrual for coupon payments
required under these derivative contracts.
(3) The

At March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009, in
connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions,
the company recorded net gains of $106 million and $661 million (before taxes),
respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Of this amount,
$8 million and $531 million of gains are expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying anticipated transactions. At March 31, 2010 and March 31,
2009, net losses of approximately $16 million and
$16 million (before taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the

companys borrowings. Of these amounts, $10 million
and $13 million of losses, respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying transactions.
 
For the three months
ending March 31, 2010, and March 31, 2009, there were no significant
gains or losses recognized in earnings representing hedge ineffectiveness or
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (for fair value hedges), or
associated with an underlying exposure that did not or was not expected to
occur (for cash flow hedges); nor are there any anticipated in the normal
course of business.

The
increase in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2010, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior
year, was principally the result of an increase related to restricted and
performance-based stock units ($49 million), partially offset by a reduction in
the level of stock option grants ($17 million).
 
As
of March 31, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $958
million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
 
There
was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31,
2010 and 2009.
 
9. Segments: The following
table reflects the results of operations of the segments consistent with the
companys management and measurement system. These results are not necessarily
a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP. Performance
measurement is based on pre-tax income. These results are used, in part, by
senior management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating
resources to, each of the segments.

The company received a
$9.0 million subsidy in the first quarter of 2010 in connection with the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion
of this amount is used by the company to reduce its obligation and expense
related to the plan, and the remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce
contributions required by the participants. 
For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act,
see page 121 in the companys 2009 Annual Report.
 
12. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
Acquisitions: During the three months ended March 31,
2010, the company completed five acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $996
million.
 
The Software
segment completed three acquisitions in the first quarter: Lombardi Software, Inc.,
Intelliden Inc. and Initiate Systems, Inc., all privately held
companies.  Global Technology Services
(GTS) completed one acquisition in the first quarter: the core operating assets
of Wilshire Credit Corporation.  Global
Business Services (GBS) completed one acquisition in the first quarter:  National Interest Security Company, LLC, a
privately held company.
 
Each acquisition
further complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of product
offerings.  Lombardi is a leading
provider of business process management software and services and will become
part of the companys application integration software portfolio. Intelliden is
a leading provider of intelligent network automation software and will extend
the companys network management offerings. Initiate is a market leader in data
integrity software for information sharing among health care and government
organizations. Wilshires mortgage servicing platform will continue the companys
strategic focus on the mortgage services industry and strengthens its
commitment to deliver mortgage business process outsourcing solutions.
 National Interest Security Company will strengthen the companys ability
to deliver advanced analytics and IT solutions to the public sector. Purchase
price consideration for all acquisitions is paid in cash. All acquisitions are
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and
cash equivalents.
 
The table below reflects

The acquisitions were
accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method, and
accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquired entities were recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify
as an amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life of the
identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 6.0 years. With the
exception of goodwill, these identified intangible assets will be amortized on
a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill of $724 million has
been assigned to the Software ($439 million), GTS ($31 million) and GBS ($253
million) segments. It is expected that approximately 25 percent of the goodwill
will be deductible for tax purposes.
 
Divestitures: On March 31, 2010, the company
completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of
Dassault Systemes (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software,
including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. The company
received net proceeds of $459 million and recognized a net gain of $591 million
on the transaction in the first quarter of 2010. The gain was net of the fair
value of certain contractual terms, certain transaction costs and the assets
and liabilities sold. The gain was recorded in other (income) and expense on
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and the net proceeds are reflected in
proceeds from disposition of marketable securities and other investments within
cash flow from investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.
 
On March 16,
2009, the company completed the sale of certain processes, resources, assets
and third-party contracts related to its core logistics operations to Geodis.
The company received cash proceeds of $365 million and recognized a net gain of
$298 million on the transaction in the first quarter of 2009. The gain was net
of the fair value of certain contractual terms, certain transaction costs and
related real estate charges. As part of this transaction, the company
outsourced its logistics operations to Geodis which will enable the company to
leverage industry-leading skills and scale and improve the productivity of the
companys supply chain.
 
In
2007, the company divested 51 percent of its printing business (InfoPrint) to
Ricoh. The company also stated that it would divest its remaining ownership to
Ricoh quarterly over a three year period from the closing date. At March 31,
2010, the companys ownership in InfoPrint was 3.9 percent. See the companys 2009
Annual Report on pages 85 and 86 for additional information.

The
net carrying amount of intangible assets increased $105 million during the
first quarter of 2010, primarily due to acquired intangibles additions,
partially offset by amortization. The aggregate intangible amortization expense
was $286 million and $312 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2010
and 2009, respectively. In addition, in the first quarter, the company retired
$400 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross
carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
 
The
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to
intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial

15.
Contingencies The company is involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits,
investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of its business, including actions with respect to contracts,
intellectual property (IP), product liability, employment, benefits,
securities, foreign operations, antitrust and environmental matters. These
actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, partners, clients, current or former employees, government and
regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which
the company does business.
 
The following is a
summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company.
 
The company is a
defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake
City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to
Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of
AT&Ts UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet
issued its decision. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy
protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed. On August 25, 2009,
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved the appointment
of a Chapter 11 Trustee of SCO. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc.
v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010.  The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX
and UnixWare copyrights, and the issues currently pending before the judge
include whether SCO is obligated to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims
against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements.
 
On November 29,
2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc. (PSI)
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
alleging that PSI violated certain intellectual property rights of IBM. PSI
asserted counterclaims against IBM. On January 11, 2008, the court
permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems, to intervene as
a counterclaim-plaintiff. T3 claimed that IBM violated certain antitrust laws
by refusing to license its patents and trade secrets to PSI and by tying the
sales of its mainframe computers to its mainframe operating systems. On June 30,
2008, IBM acquired PSI.  As a result of
this transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed all claims against each other, and PSI
withdrew a complaint it had filed with the European Commission in October 2007
with regard to IBM. On September 30, 2009, the court granted IBMs motion
for summary judgment and dismissed T3s claims against IBM. This decision has
been appealed by T3. In January 2009, T3 filed a complaint with the
European Commission alleging that IBM violated European Union competition law
based on the facts alleged in the above-referenced U.S. litigation involving
T3.  In March 2010, TurboHercules
SAS filed a similar complaint with the European Commission.  IBM has been notified that the
 
30





Table of
Contents
 
Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ) and the European Commission are investigating possible antitrust
violations by IBM. The DOJ has requested certain information, including the
production of materials from the litigation between T3 and IBM, and the
European Commission has also requested certain information.
 
The company is a
defendant in an action filed on December 14, 2009 in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Texas by Neon Enterprise Software,
LLC. Neon alleges that the company has interfered with Neons efforts to
license its zPrime software. They seek damages and injunctive relief. In late January 2010,
IBM filed its answer to Neons complaint and asserted counterclaims against
Neon.
 
In January 2004, the
Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea announced it had brought
criminal bid-rigging charges against several companies, including IBM Korea and
LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and LG electronics, which has since
been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and had also charged employees of some
of those entities with, among other things, bribery of certain officials of
government-controlled entities in Korea and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM
cooperated fully with authorities in these matters. A number of individuals,
including former IBM Korea and LG IBM employees, were subsequently found guilty
and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM were also required to pay fines. Debarment
orders were imposed at different times, covering a period of no more than a
year from the date of issuance, which barred IBM Korea from doing business
directly with certain government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment
orders have since expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM
Korea from selling products and services to business partners who sold to
government-controlled entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of
Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have both contacted
the company in connection with this matter. In March 2008, the company
received a request from the SEC for additional information.
 
The company is a
defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the Supreme
Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of hundreds of
plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of action,
including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and trespass.
Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages in
unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.
 
The company is party to,
or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state
environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws similar
to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate
in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The
company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or
remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites
globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country,
state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims
concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The company is also
subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various
jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil,
the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian authorities
regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters.
These matters include claims for taxes on the importation of computer software.
In November 2008, the company won a significant case in the Superior
Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil, and in late July 2009,
the company received written confirmation regarding this decision. The total
potential amount related to the remaining matters for all applicable years is
approximately $600 million. The company believes it will prevail on these
matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.
 
The company records a
provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are reviewed at least quarterly
and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the impact and status of
settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information pertinent to a
particular matter. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such
liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, were not material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its experience, the company
believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters previously referred to
are not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters previously discussed. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is
 
31





Table of
Contents
 
Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
possible that the companys
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these
matters.
 
Whether any losses,
damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit, investigation
or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the companys
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend
on a number of variables, including the timing and amount of such losses or
damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the
impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on the Consolidated
Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular
matter which may give rise to additional factors.
 
16. Commitments: The companys
extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of
$3,619 million and $3,576 million at March 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $2,634 million and $2,788
million at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 
The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 
The company is a party to a
variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the
company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising
from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title
to the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified
environmental matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual
obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these
circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making
a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular
contract, which procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other
partys claims. While typically indemnification provisions do not include a
contractual maximum on the companys payment, the companys obligations under
these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in
some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain
payments made by the company.
 
It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had
a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.
 
In addition, the company
guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential
future payment under these financial guarantees was $83 million and $85 million
at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The fair value
of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position was not material.

17. Subsequent
Events: On April 27, 2010, the company announced that the
Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per common share. The
dividend is payable June 10, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 10,
2010. The dividend declaration represents an increase of $0.10 and is 18
percent higher than the prior quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share.
 
On April 27, 2010, the company
announced that the Board of Directors authorized $8 billion in additional funds
for use in the companys common stock repurchase program.

*   (0.1) percent adjusted for currency
 
Within the Management
Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at constant
currency are made so that certain financial results can be viewed without the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results
adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in
local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion
rate. This approach is based on the pricing currency for each country, which is
typically the functional currency.
 
In the first quarter of
2010, the company continued to deliver value to its clients and solid financial
results to its investors  with profit
growth driven by improved revenue performance, an improving business mix,
continued margin expansion, expense productivity and a continuing strong cash
position. The financial performance in the quarter continued to reflect the
strength of the companys global model and the results of the strategic
transformation of the business.
 
The companys transformation
is driven by a combination of shifting the business mix to higher value areas,
improving operating leverage through productivity and investing to capture
growth opportunities.
 
Total revenue increased 5.3
percent (flat adjusted for currency) compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Revenue performance was very strong in the companys key growth investment
areas. Total revenue from the growth markets increased 20.0 percent (8 percent
adjusted for currency) with performance driven by the BRIC countries of Brazil,
Russia, India and China, which increased 23.0 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency) as these countries build out and integrate their public and private
infrastructures. Segment performance was driven by Software, which increased
10.6 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), with share gains in each of the
middleware software brands. Business analytics is one of the fundamental
drivers of the Software performance, and across both Software and Global
Services business analytics revenue increased at a double-digit rate in the
first quarter compared to the prior year.
 
In  January 2010,
the company stated that it expected to improve its year-to-year revenue growth
rate from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010 by 4-5 points
at both actual currency rates and at constant currency. In the first quarter of
2010, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the revenue growth rate
improved 4 points on an as reported basis and 5 points at constant currency.
With the dollar strengthening, currency was less of a help than anticipated,
contributing approximately 5 points of growth versus the 6-7 points expected
based on the mid-January spot rates. This impacted revenue by
approximately $250

million,
highlighting that the companys underlying business performance was better than
expected.  The improvement in revenue
growth from the fourth quarter was broad-based with improvements across the
companys major segments and geographies. In addition, both the major markets
and growth markets improved  the major markets improved 4 points (5 points
adjusted for currency) and the growth markets improved 6 points as reported and
at constant currency.

Total expense and other
income increased 2.4 percent in the first quarter compared to the prior year.
The year-to-year drivers were approximately :
 
·                  Operational expense, (5) points
·                  Currency, 7 points
·                  Acquisitions, 1 point
 
In the first quarter, the company completed the sale
of its Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software activities to Dassault and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $591 million on the transaction. In addition,
companys workforce rebalancing charges in the quarter were $559 million with
the majority of the spending in Europe and Asia Pacific. In the first quarter
of 2009, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $298 million related to the
sale of its core logistics operations to Geodis. Workforce rebalancing charges
in that quarter were $265 million. The combined impact of these 2010 and 2009
actions had no impact on the companys first quarter 2010 year-to-year
consolidated financial performance as highlighted in the table on the following
page:

Pre-tax income grew 12.6
percent and the pre-tax margin was 15.4 percent, an increase of 1.0 points
versus the first quarter of 2009. Net income increased 13.3 percent reflecting
a slight improvement in the tax rate. The effective tax rate for the first
quarter was 26.0 percent, compared with 26.5 percent in the prior year.
 
Diluted earnings per share
improved 15.9 percent reflecting the strong growth in net income and the
benefits of the common stock repurchase program. In the first quarter, the
company repurchased 32 million shares of its common stock. Diluted earnings per
share of $1.97 increased $0.27 from the prior year driven by the following
factors :
 



·


Revenue
  increase at actual rates:


$0.09




·


Gross
  margin increase of 0.2 points: 


$0.03




·


Expense
  productivity:


$0.10




·


Tax
  rate decrease of 0.5 points:


$0.01




·


Common
  stock repurchases:


$0.04



 
In the first quarter, the
improvement in earnings per share was balanced with contribution from all the
key drivers  revenue growth, margin expansion and the effective use of cash.
 
At March 31, 2010, the
companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong and are
well-positioned to support the companys full year objectives. Key drivers in
the companys balance sheet and total cash flows are highlighted below.
 
Total
assets decreased $3,814 million ($2,616 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009 driven by:
 
·                  Decreases in total receivables ($4,383
million) and deferred taxes ($822 million), partially offset by;
·                  Increased goodwill ($699 million),
investments and sundry assets ($414 million), prepaid pension assets ($288
million) and intangible assets ($105 million).
 
The company had $13,977
million in cash and marketable securities at March 31, 2010. This balance
was flat compared to the prior year-end position.
 
Total
liabilities decreased $3,208 million ($2,074 million adjusted for currency)
from December 31, 2009 driven by:
 
·                  Decreases in accounts payable ($1,091
million), taxes ($1,051 million), compensation and benefits ($804 million) and
retirement and nonpension postretirement ($736 million), partially offset by;
·                  Increased deferred income ($505 million).
 
Total
equity of $22,149 million decreased $606 million from December 31, 2009 as
a result of:
 
·                  Increased treasury stock ($3,994 million) and
lower foreign currency translation adjustments ($152 million), partially offset
by;
·                  Higher retained earnings ($1,884 million),
common stock ($854 million) and increased net unrealized gains on cash flow
derivatives ($539 million).
 
Total Global Services
signings were $12,266 million, a decrease of 2.1 percent (7 percent adjusted
for currency) versus the first quarter of 2009. Signings performance was
impacted by a decline in Application Management Services signings of 23 percent
(27 percent adjusted for currency) due to a very strong quarter in the prior
year; excluding Application Management Services signings, total signings would
have increased 4 percent (decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency). The
estimated Global Services backlog was $134 billion at March 31, 2010, up
$8 billion ($1 billion adjusted for currency) versus the prior year quarter-end
balance and a decrease of $3 billion ($1 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009.

In addition to delivering
solid financial results , the company completed several actions in the first
quarter to continue to transform the business  shifting to higher value areas
and improving the companys structure :
 
·                  Completed five acquisitions investing in key
capabilities that support the growth initiatives
·                  Completed the sale of the PLM software
activities
·                  Introduced new mid-range POWER7 offerings and
will deliver new high-end POWER7 and mainframe systems later in the year to
drive share gains in the second half of the year
·                  Continued to focus on increasing the
productivity of the business
 
These actions will improve
the companys strategic position and business model going forward.
 
In January 2010, the
company disclosed that it is expecting earnings of at least $11.00 per diluted
share for the full year 2010. In April 2010, the company increased its
expectation for 2010 to at least $11.20 in earnings per share for the full
year.

The workforce rebalancing charges recorded in the
first quarter of 2009 and 2010 and the PLM and Geodis transactions did impact
the year-to-year results of the companys reportable segments. Workforce
rebalancing charges were incurred in every segment in both periods. The PLM
transaction gain was recorded in Software in the first quarter of 2010 and the
Geodis transaction gain was recorded in the following segments in the first
quarter of 2009: Global Technology Services ($81 million), Global Business
Services ($46 million), Software ($106 million) and Systems and  Technology ($64 million). In the segment
analysis below and in the Global Financing analysis on page 56, each
segments pre-tax income and pre-tax margin is presented on an as reported
basis and on a basis normalized for these actions in both years to provide a
better perspective of the underlying operational performance of the segments.
 
Global Services
 
The Global Services segments,
Global Technology Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS), had
combined revenue of $13,716 million, an increase of 4.3 percent (decrease of 2
percent adjusted for currency) versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency,
the services revenue growth rate improved versus the fourth quarter of 2009 in
total and in Strategic Outsourcing, Business Transformation Outsourcing,
Integrated Technology Services, Maintenance and GBS, driven primarily by growth
in outsourcing signings over the past 12 months and a return to signings growth
in consulting this quarter. Total Global Services signings of $12,266 million
decreased 2.1 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency). In the quarter, the
company signed 13 deals greater than $100 million. Outsourcing signings of
$6,776 million decreased 3.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter, while on a trailing 12 months basis, have increased 5 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency). Transactional signings were $5,491 million, a
decrease of 1.0 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency). In the first quarter
of 2010, there was a shift in demand towards transformational offerings driving
consulting signings up 18 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency). The
estimated Global Services backlog at actual currency rates was $134 billion at March 31,
2010, an increase of $8 billion ($1 billion adjusted for currency) from March 31,
2009 and a decrease of $3 billion ($1 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2009. The backlog reflected improved stability in the base accounts with
backlog erosion at the lowest level in two years.

GTS
Outsourcing  revenue increased 7.7
percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). The revenue growth rate improved
from fourth-quarter 2009 reflecting demand for Business Transformation
Outsourcing and Strategic Outsourcing (SO) over the past 12 months.  GTS Outsourcing signings in the first quarter
increased 0.9 percent (decreased 4 percent adjusted for currency). SO signings
were up 5.9 percent (flat adjusted for currency) with strong growth in North
America.
 
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 1.9 percent (decreased 4 percent
adjusted for currency). The revenue growth rate improved from the fourth
quarter of 2009, adjusted for currency. ITS signings were up 0.2 percent (down
5 percent adjusted for currency) with the strongest performance in the growth
markets and improvement in labor-based services in North America.
 
Global
Business Services revenue increased 0.3 percent (decreased 5 percent adjusted
for currency) versus the first quarter of 2009. The improved revenue
performance from the fourth quarter of 2009 was driven by strong growth in
consulting signings which translated to revenue quickly in the first quarter,
and revenue from Application Management Services (AMS) signings over the last
12 months. Total GBS signings decreased 6.4 percent (12 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to the first quarter of 2009. Consulting signings increased
18 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) representing the first quarter of
growth, adjusted for currency, in consulting signings since the fourth quarter
of 2008. Signings are beginning to reflect a shift in customer buying patterns
towards more transformational offerings, which are primarily reflected in the
consulting business. The company has reengineered this business to align with
the strategy around smarter planet and business analytics  making investments
and adding skilled resources.  Consulting
signings in the growth markets were up 35 percent adjusted for currency, and
smarter planet and business analytics offerings constituted 25 percent of total
consulting signings. AMS signings decreased 23 percent (27 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to a strong first quarter of 2009 where there were a handful
of large deals. While AMS signings have increased on a trailing 12 month basis,
the decline had an impact on total services signings performance in the first
quarter.

Global Services signings are managements initial
estimate of the revenue value of a clients commitment under a Global Services
contract. Signings are used by management to assess period performance of
Global Services management. There are no third-party standards or requirements
governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves
estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including
the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges
or wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS Outsourcing, ITS and GBS
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new revenue value. Maintenance is not
included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state,
where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS and
Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under
contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject
to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes
in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not
materialized and adjustments for currency.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Software revenue of $5,018 million increased 10.6
percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2010 compared
to the first quarter of 2009. This performance is a direct result of the
companys sustained investment in the Software business. Organic investments,
complemented by strategic acquisitions, have enabled the Software business to
deliver unique capabilities and value to its customers.

Key
Branded Middleware revenue increased 13.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for
currency) and gained share for the tenth straight quarter as the business
continues to extend its lead in the middleware market. Each of the five key
middleware brands gained share in the first quarter. Revenue performance was
particularly strong in business integration, business analytics and storage
management software. This contributed to strong brand revenue performance in
WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli.
 
WebSphere
Family revenue increased 13.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter of 2010. Business Integration offerings, which deliver value to
customers by enabling them to make their processes more predictive, agile and
collaborative, had revenue growth of 23 percent. ILOG, which plays a key role
in the companys Smarter Planet initiative by providing business rules management,
performed well again this quarter with revenue growth of 35 percent.
 
Information
Management revenue increased 11.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Business
analytics continues to be a key growth area for the Software business. Cognos
posted strong double-digit revenue growth and gained share in the first quarter
 providing a proof point on business analytics demand in the market.
 
Lotus
revenue increased 1.3 percent (decreased 3 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first quarter of 2010, a significant improvement over recent performance,
driven by a 31 percent increase in advanced collaboration software. This
software improves customers productivity by enabling the efficient sharing of
information.
 
Tivoli
revenue increased 23.3 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter and gained share across all three of its market segments. Within
systems management, Enterprise Asset Management, which includes Maximo
products, had double-digit revenue growth. This is a key component of the
Smarter Planet strategy. Revenue growth was broad based across the geographies,
most notably in the growth markets. Storage management software also had
double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter, which complements the strong
growth in storage hardware. Tivoli storage software has now had over 20
consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Security software also had solid growth
in the first quarter, driven by strong sales across the portfolio.
 
Rational
revenue increased 7.2 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2010. Rational provides an integrated suite of products to manage
the business process of software and systems delivery.
 
Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM) revenue increased 2.0 percent (decreased 3 percent
adjusted for currency).  The sale of the
companys PLM activities, where Dassault owned the product IP and the company
acted as a sales channel, is consistent with the strategy of divesting lower
value businesses. The sale will have a positive effect on software margins
beginning in the second quarter and will improve the software revenue profile
over time. In the next four quarters, the loss of the PLM revenue will impact
the software revenue growth rate by 2-3 points.

Systems
and Technology revenue increased 4.9 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009. This is an 11
point improvement in the year-to-year growth rate at constant currency from the
fourth quarter of 2009. Systems and Technology 
revenue growth was driven by strong performance in System x, Systems Storage,
Microelectronics and Retail Stores Solutions. The company gained share in
System Storage (both disk and tape), System x, Retail Stores Solutions and the
mid-range of Power Systems, which was driven by the introduction of POWER 7
products. The company held share in high-end servers.
 
System
z revenue decreased 16.6 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter versus the prior year, while MIPS (millions of instructions per
second) volumes declined 19 percent year-to-year, after increasing 18 percent
in the first quarter of 2009. This performance is consistent with what the
company expected at this point in the product cycle. In the second half of the
year, the company will be releasing the next generation System z mainframe.
 
Power
Systems revenue decreased 17.0 percent (20 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009. The decrease was
primarily driven by high-end servers. In the first quarter, the company
continued to displace UNIX competitors, with over 170 competitive wins in the
quarter totaling over $125 million. In the mid-range, the company introduced
POWER 7 in February 2010, which further extended the companys
price/performance advantage versus others competing in the UNIX market.
High-end POWER 7 products will be announced later this year.
 
System x revenue increased
36.3 percent (31 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2010
versus the prior year. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of share gain in
x86. The improved sales model and enhanced product offerings were the key
contributors to the revenue performance. System x blades revenue increased 55
percent versus the prior year period.
 
System Storage revenue increased
10.8 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2010
versus the first quarter of 2009. Total disk revenue increased 18 percent (14
percent adjusted for currency) primarily due to double-digit growth in
enterprise, mid-range and low-end products. In the high-end, revenue growth was
driven by XIV, which added 75 new clients to its platform in the first-quarter.
Tape revenue decreased 5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) versus the
first quarter of 2009. The storage hardware results complement the strong
performance in storage software, as storage hardware and software combined grew
14 percent year over year.
 
Microelectronics
OEM revenue increased 15.5 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. The primary
mission of this business is to provide leadership technology for the systems
business. The companys 300 millimeter fabrication facility is nearing full
utilization and the 45 nanometer process output was sold out again this
quarter.

Revenue from the major
markets increased 2.0 percent (decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first quarter and the revenue growth rate improved 5 points, adjusted for
currency, from the fourth-quarter 2009, led by better performance in the U.S.,
France, Germany, Japan, the U.K. and Italy. Revenue from the growth markets
increased 20.0 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) with growth, adjusted
for currency, outpacing the major markets by 10 points. Revenue growth was led
by the BRIC countries with growth of 23.0 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency). Sequentially, the rate of revenue growth in the growth markets
improved 6 points from the fourth quarter of 2009 as market conditions improved
in most countries. Government spending and programs remain a tailwind in most
countries and the strongest performance came from the Public Sector. The
largest improvement from the fourth-quarter 2009 was in sales to small and
medium business clients, driven by growth in Global Services, Power Systems, Storage and
System x. The company is having great success expanding its footprint in the
growth markets, which provides a base on which to grow additional business.
 
Americas revenue
increased 2.5 percent (flat adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of
2010. Within the major market countries, the U.S. declined 1.3 percent and
Canada increased 19.5 percent (flat adjusted for currency). Revenue in the Latin
America growth markets increased 22.2 percent (13 percent adjusted for
currency) led by growth in Brazil, which increased 42.6 percent (19 percent
adjusted for currency).
 
EMEA revenue increased
5.2 percent (decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of
2010 and was led by growth in the U.K. of 17.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for
currency). Revenue performance was mixed in other major market countries with
Germany up 3.8 percent (down 2 percent adjusted for currency), France down 0.4
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency), Italy down 3.0 percent (9 percent
adjusted for currency) and Spain up 4.8 percent (down 1 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
Asia Pacific revenue
increased 9.5 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) year over year. Revenue
from the Asia Pacific growth market countries increased 20.9 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency), led by growth in China of 7.3 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency) and India of 24.0 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency). Japan revenue decreased 0.1 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
OEM revenue of $543
million in the first quarter of 2010 increased 17.8 percent (17 percent

Total
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 7.8 percent (1
percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first
quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by approximately 7 points due to the effects
of currency and acquisition-related spending which accounted for approximately
1 point of the year-to-year increase. Workforce reductions expense
increased $293 million due to actions taken by the company in the first-quarter 2010,
with the majority of the spending in Europe and Asia Pacific. The company
expects most of the benefit from these actions in the second half of 2010, with
payback by the end of the year. Bad debt expense decreased $90 million
reflecting the improving credit environment. The accounts receivable provision
coverage is 2.1 percent, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year and
an increase of 10 basis points from year-end 2009.

Other
(income) and expense was income of $545 million in the first quarter of 2010
versus income of $304 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in
income was driven by the net gain ($591 million)  from the PLM transaction reflected in Other
in the table above. The first quarter of 2009 included the net gain
($298 million) from the divestiture of the core logistics
operations to Geodis, also reflected in Other in the table. In addition, income
increased due to higher foreign currency transaction gains ($93 million) in the
first quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.
 
These
increases were partially offset by higher losses on derivative instruments
($138 million) versus the first quarter of 2009. Included within the foreign
currency hedging activity, the company hedges its major anticipated
cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility in its
global cash planning (the hedge of anticipated royalties and cost transactions
programs as discussed in Note 7, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on pages 16
to 23), which also reduces volatility in the year-over-year results.  The total impact of these specific hedging
programs was a $358 million year-to-year impact and is reflected in expense and
cost of goods sold.  The expense impacts
from these cash flow hedge programs reflected in other (income) and expense was
$29 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus income of $95 million in the
first quarter of 2009, an increase in expense of $124 million year to year.

Taxes
 
The effective tax rates for the first quarter of 2010
and 2009 were 26.0 percent and 26.5 percent, respectively. The decline in the
rate was primarily due to an increase in foreign tax credits and a tax benefit
related to a partial resolution of a foreign tax audit, offset by the tax
impact of the PLM transaction gain, a tax charge from the intercompany
licensing of certain intellectual property, the elimination of the U.S.
research tax credit which expired in December 2009 and the tax impact
related to the Medicare subsidies received by the company as a result of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its companion Health Care and
Education Affordability Reconciliation Act which were enacted in the first
quarter.
 
With limited exception,
the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2003. The years
subsequent to 2003 contain matters that could be subject to differing
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the
amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome
of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts
of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to
result for these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 decreased
by $410 million in the first three months to $4,380 million. The decrease in
the unrecognized tax benefits was primarily driven by a  payment of approximately $370 million on an
assessment received related to a foreign audit. The total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate
is $3,785 million at March 31, 2010.
 
In addition, the company
has certain foreign tax loss carryforwards that have not been reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. In April the company decided
to seek benefit for these losses and appeal the assessment mentioned above. As
a result the company would expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at
the end of the second quarter to increase by approximately $1.3 billion for
this item.
 
The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2006
and 2007 in the first quarter of 2009. 
The company anticipates that the final settlement of the 2006-2007 IRS
audit will be completed by the end of 2010.

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At
March 31, 2010, the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain
strong. Cash on hand at quarter end was $12,472 million. Total debt of $26,319
million increased $220 million from prior year-end levels. The commercial paper
balance at March 31, 2010 was $2,038 
million, up from $235 million at year end. The company continues to have
substantial flexibility in the market. In the first quarter, the company
generated $4,437 million in cash from operations, an increase of $50 million
compared to the first quarter of 2009. The company has consistently generated
strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional
sources of liquidity though the capital markets and its $10 billion global
credit facility. The companys strong cash flow and substantial cash position
permits the company to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most
attractive long-term opportunities.

Working
capital decreased $1,811 million from the year-end 2009 position. The key
changes are described below:
 
Current
assets decreased $3,238 million ($2,561 million adjusted for currency), due to:
 
·                  A decline of $3,282 million in short-term
receivables driven by:
 
·                  a decrease of $2,759 million primarily due to
collections of higher year-end balances, and
 
·                  approximately $523 million currency impact.
 
·                  Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities
were essentially unchanged from year-end 
(see cash flow analysis below).
 
Current
liabilities decreased $1,427 million, including a $397 million benefit from
currency, as a result of:
 
·                  A decrease in accounts payable of $1,091
million (including a currency benefit of $100 million) and a decrease of $804
million (including a currency benefit of $67 million) in compensation and
benefits reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances; and
 
·                  A decrease of $1,051 million in taxes payable
primarily due to foreign tax payments in the first quarter of 2010; partially
offset by
 
·                  An increase in short-term debt of $846
million primarily driven by:
 
·                  a net increase of $1,803 million in
commercial paper and $1,061 million in new debt issuances; and
 
·                  reclasses of $620 million from long-term to
short-term debt to reflect maturity dates; partially offset by
 
·                  $2,424 million
in payments;
 
·                  An increase in deferred income of $611
million ($821 million adjusted for currency);
 
·                  Other accrued expenses and liabilities were
essentially flat as a result of:
 
·                  an increase of $282 million in workforce
rebalancing accruals; offset by
 
·                  a decrease of $381 million in derivative
liabilities as a result of changes in foreign currency rates primarily for instruments
in cash flow hedging relationships.

Net
cash from operating activities increased $50 million as compared to the first
quarter of 2009 driven by the following key factors:
 
·                  A decrease in cash used in compensation and
benefits of $413 million;
 
·                  An increase in cash provided by advanced
billings to clients of $362 million;
 
·                  Improved net income $306 million;
 
·                  Lower retirement-related funding for non-U.S.
plans of $200 million; and
 
·                  Lower payments for workforce rebalancing of
$148 million; partially offset by
 
·                  Higher net income tax payments of  approximately $679 million driven by foreign
tax payments;
 
·                  A decrease in cash provided by accounts
receivable of $443 million, driven by Global Financing receivables as a result
of improved volumes in 2010; and
 
·                  A decrease in cash of $273 million as a
result of lower U.S. Federal tax refunds.
 
Net
cash used in investing activities increased $651 million driven by:
 
·                  An increase of $803 million in cash used for
acquisitions; and
 
·                  A decrease in cash from divestitures of $356
million as a result of the Geodis transaction in 2009; partially offset by
 
·                  Net benefit of $582 million from purchases
and sales of marketable securities and other investments that resulted in a
source of cash of $572 million in the current year, driven by the PLM
transaction proceeds in comparison to a use of cash in 2009 of $11 million.
 
Net
cash used in financing activities decreased $1,216 million as a result of:
 
·                  Net benefit of $2,866 million from debt that
resulted in net cash proceeds from debt in the current year of $481 million in
comparison to net cash payments to settle debt of $2,385 million in 2009; and
 
·                  An increase of $643 million in cash generated
from other common stock transactions primarily due to higher stock option
exercises; partially offset by
 
·                  Higher common stock repurchases of $2,251
million.

Other
noncurrent liabilities, excluding debt, decreased $1,155 million ($556 million

to currency) primarily driven by contributions to non-U.S. plans; and
 
·                  A decrease of
$312 million in other noncurrent liabilities mainly due to a decrease in
derivative liabilities as a result of changes in foreign currency rates
primarily for instruments in cash flow hedging relationships.
 
Debt
 
The
companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are
executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the
company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as
needed.

Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client
assets as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets,
primarily for Global Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams
similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these
Global Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing
asset base. The debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing
section on page 59.
 
Given
the significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio
which excludes Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is
more representative of the companys core business operations. This ratio can
vary from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt
positions.
 
Core
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
17.7 percent at March 31, 2010 compared to 16.0 percent at December 31,
2009. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in non-Global Financing
debt of $357 million and a decrease in non-Global Financing equity of $627
million from December 31, 2009 balances.
 
Consolidated
debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2010 was 54.3 percent versus
53.4 percent at December 31, 2009.
 
Equity
 
Total
equity decreased $606 million primarily as a result of an increase in treasury
stock of $3,994 million, driven by common stock repurchases in the first
quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $1,884
million,  an increase of $854 million in
common stock and lower accumulated other comprehensive losses of $652 million.

Looking Forward
 
The company entered 2010 in excellent operational and
financial position. Going-forward, the company will continue to transform the
business by executing its strategy to shift to higher value areas, improving
operating leverage through productivity and investing where management sees the
best long-term opportunities. This transformation delivered solid performance
again in the first quarter of 2010 and continues to position the company for
growth going forward.
 
In May 2007, the company met with investors and
analysts and discussed a road map to deliver earnings per share in 2010 in the
range of $10 to $11 per share, or 14 to 16 percent compound growth rate from
2006. The companys 2010 road map is comprised of two key components. First,
the 2010 road map includes generating earnings per share in the range of $9 to
$10 per share, or 10 to 14 percent growth from 2006 through a combination of
operational elements including revenue growth, margin improvement, growth
initiatives, acquisitions and effective capital deployment to fund growth and
provide returns to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.
 
In addition to these operational elements, the companys
road map to the $10 to $11 per share range includes the projected benefit of
retirement-related costs based on December 31, 2006 assumptions. Actual
retirement-related costs have depended on several factors including financial
market performance, the interest rate environment and actuarial assumptions. In
March 2008 and May 2009, the company met with investors and analysts
and discussed the progress the company was making on its 2010 road map.
 
The companys performance in 2009 highlighted the
benefits of its global reach and the strength of its business model. The
financial results reflected solid progress on major elements of the long-term
goals. Despite a challenging economy, with diluted earnings per share of $10.01
in 2009, the company achieved its road map objective one year early.
 
In January 2010, the company disclosed that it is
expecting earnings of at least $11.00 per diluted share for the full year 2010,
with consistent earnings per share growth throughout the year. In April 2010,
the company increased its expectation for 2010 to at least $11.20 in earnings
per diluted share for the full year. In addition, for the second quarter of
2010, the company expects to deliver year-to-year revenue growth at constant
currency. The company is confident in its ability to improve its revenue
performance and to continue to leverage its business model to expand margins,
grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders in 2010.
 
The continued investments in Software have led to this
segments emergence as a strong source of revenue and the largest contributor
to the companys pre-tax profit. The Software business is differentiated in the
industry by both the strength of its individual products and the breadth of the
software offerings. Clients continue to rely on the extensive middleware
portfolio to help them transform their business, streamline costs and seek new
business opportunities. The key to continued Software growth stems from the
ability to maintain and grow this industry leading software portfolio.
Investments will be aligned to advance the companys growth strategy through
new client acquisition, with specific focus on key industries and local
businesses. The company will also continue to focus on expanding its software
capabilities through a combination of internal development and strategic
acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2010, the company expects Softwares
revenue performance at constant currency to be similar to first quarter
performance, adjusting for the impact of the PLM transaction.
 
Within the Global Services business, the revenue
growth rate improved three points at constant currency compared to the fourth
quarter of 2009. The company continues to yield significant results from the
targeted actions and investments it has made in the last few years. The
business has been transformed into one that is more flexible and more focused
on higher-value segments of the market. The two services segments have good momentum
going forward driven by outsourcing signings growth in both GTS and GBS over
the past twelve months, first quarter consulting signings growth , the expected
second half  benefits from the workforce
rebalancing actions and a backlog of $134 billion at March 31, 2010. The
company expects Global Services to deliver modest revenue growth at constant
currency in the second quarter of 2010. The company also expects GTS to return
to pre-tax income growth and margin expansion over the balance of the year.

(continued)
 
The Systems and Technology
business will continue to invest in areas that contribute to high value growth
opportunities. It will focus on technologies that differentiate its offerings,
including industry-leading microprocessor technology, workload optimized
systems and infrastructure-wide virtualization capabilities with tools that
help clients consolidate resources, manage workloads, automate processes,
improve energy efficiency and optimize delivery of IT services. The systems product line will be
significantly refreshed in 2010. In the first quarter the POWER7 midrange
systems were announced with the high-end products to be announced later this
year. In addition, the next generation System z mainframe will be released in
the second half of the year. In the second quarter of 2010, the company expects
the Systems and Technology business to deliver revenue growth at constant
currency in the mid-single-digits with the growth rate to accelerate through
the second half of the year driven by the new high-end products to a
double-digit rate at constant currency by the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
In 2010, Global Financing will continue to focus on
expanding its core business by accelerating growth in the participation rates
for IBM products and services transactions. In addition, the business will
drive increased operational efficiency and sales productivity through the
deployment of its single operating model initiative. This global initiative is
focused on simplifying processes, standardizing operations and optimizing
business performance.
 
The company expects 2010 pre-tax retirement-related
plan cost to be approximately $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately $100
million compared to 2009. This estimate reflects current pension plan
assumptions and the impacts of recent non-U.S. pension plan redesign efforts.
See the companys 2009 Annual Report, note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, on
pages 109 through 121 for additional information.
 
The company expects in the normal course of business
that its effective tax rate in 2010 will be approximately 26.0-26.5 percent.
The rate will change period to period based on non-recurring events, such as
the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as
recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, the
timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and
the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
Effective January 1,
2010, the company implemented several new accounting standards that were issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These standards include: amended guidance
for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables; guidance
that revises the scope of existing software revenue recognition accounting;
amendments to the accounting rules for variable interest entities and
transfers of financial assets; and, additional disclosure requirements for fair
value measurements. There was no material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements upon adoption of these standards.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes
in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the
companys results. At March 31, 2010, currency changes resulted in assets
and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer
dollars than at year-end 2009. The company uses financial hedging instruments
to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in the 2009 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 92 through 96.
 
In the first quarter of
2010, the companys
revenue increased 5.3 percent as reported and declined 0.1 percent adjusted for
currency; that difference was driven from the companys operations in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The company maintains currency hedging
programs for cash planning purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the
volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results. In addition
to the translation of earnings, the impact of currency changes also may affect
the companys pricing and sourcing actions. For example, the company may
procure components and supplies in multiple functional currencies and sell
products and services in other currencies. The company believes that some of
these currency-based changes in cost impacts the price charged to clients.
However, the company estimates that the maximum effect of currency, before
taking pricing or sourcing actions into account, and net of hedging activity,
decreased total diluted earnings per share growth by approximately $0.01 in the
first-quarter 2010.
 
For
non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. The company continues to monitor the
economic conditions in Venezuela. In Venezuela, there are official currency
rates that are fixed by the government and a parallel market of currency
exchange that enables companies to obtain foreign currency, including U.S.
dollars. The parallel rate is variable and may differ significantly from the
official rates. Accounting guidance requires that the translation of a non-U.S.
entitys financial statements into the companys consolidated financial
statements be at the rate applicable to dividend remittances. Due to the
 
53





Table of Contents
 
Management Discussion 
(continued)
 
significant reduction of currency approvals by the
Venezuela government, in December 2009, the company determined that the
rate for translation should be changed to the parallel rate at December 31,
2009.  On January 8, 2010, a devaluation of the Venezuelan currency
was announced. The currency market in Venezuela will continue to be fully
controlled by the government through the Central Bank. A two-tiered official
rate structure was implemented and will be managed by the Central Bank. In the
first quarter of 2010, the ability to obtain U.S. dollars remained severely
restricted, even at the new devalued rates. The parallel market remains the
primary method to obtain U.S. dollars. Therefore, in the first quarter, the
company continued to remeasure utilizing the parallel rate.
 
In addition, due to the
fact that the blended CPI/NCPI three year cumulative inflation rate in
Venezuela reached 100 percent, the country is considered highly inflationary,
consistent with accounting standards, effective January 1, 2010. The
companys operations in Venezuela are not significant (less than 1 percent of
total 2008 and 2009 revenue), therefore, the company does not expect a material
impact from the shift to highly inflationary.
 
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
In
the companys 2009 Annual Report, on pages 49 through 51, there is a
discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five
years of data. The table presented on page 49 includes net cash from
operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys
global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the three months
ended, or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2010, those amounts are $4.4
billion for net cash from operating activities, $14.0 billion of cash and
marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively.
 
The
major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at March 31,
2010 appear in the table below and remain unchanged from December 31,
2009. The companys debt securities do not contain any acceleration clauses
which could change the scheduled maturities of the obligation. In addition, the
company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or
documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and
seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit
rating. The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments
contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the
agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At March 31, 2010, the fair value of those instruments that were in a
liability position was $806  million,
before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in
fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding
instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual
arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a
material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

Free
cash flow for the first quarter increased $389 million versus the first quarter
of 2009. The improvement year to year was primarily driven by higher net income
and improved cash from sales cycle working capital, offsetting significantly
higher tax payments compared to the prior year. Also, in the quarter, $4,734
million was returned to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 
Events
that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above
and in the 2009 Annual Report include significant changes
in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash,
unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension funding during
periods of severe downturn in the capital markets. Whether any litigation has
such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more
completely described in Note 15, Contingencies, on pages 30 to 32 of
this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make legally mandated pension plan
contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $800 million in
2010.  The company is not quantifying any
further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict
future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.
 
Global Financing
 
Global Financing is a
reportable segment that is measured as if it were a standalone entity.
Accordingly, the information presented in this section is consistent with this
separate company view. The mission of Global Financing is to facilitate clients
acquisition of IBM systems, software and services with the objective of
generating consistently strong returns on equity.

The decrease in revenue,
in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2009, was primarily due
to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 7.1 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency), due to decreases in financing revenue (down 7.7
percent to $415 million) and used equipment sales revenue (down 4.9 percent to
$122 million), partially offset by;

·                  Growth in internal revenue of 3.5 percent driven by an
increase in used equipment sales to the Global Technology Services segment (up
11.2 percent to $254 million), partially offset by a decrease in internal
financing revenue (down 7.4 percent to $149 million).
 
The decrease in external
and internal financing revenue was due to both lower asset yields and lower
average asset balances.
 
Gross profit increased
0.8 percent compared to the same period in 2009 due to the increase in internal
sales.  Gross margin increased 2.3 points
due to higher financing margins.
 
Pre-tax income increased
18.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010 versus the same period in 2009. The
increase was primarily driven by a decrease in financing receivables provisions of $70 million and the increase
in gross profit of $5 million, partially offset by an increase in other
expenses of $7 million. The decrease in financing receivables provisions in
2010 was primarily due to lower specific reserve requirements. Excluding $2
million and $5 million of workspace rebalancing charges in the first quarter of
2010 and 2009, respectively, pre-tax income on a normalized basis increased
17.5 percent year to year.
 
Pre-tax margin of 45.4
percent, increased 8.2 points versus the first quarter of 2009. Pre-tax margin
on a normalized basis was 45.7 percent an increase of 7.9 points.
 
The increase in return on
equity for the first quarter 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 was
driven by higher after-tax income and a lower average equity balance.

Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds
in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets.
Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM systems,
software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and
services to meet IBM clients total solutions requirements. Client financing
assets are primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for
systems products, as well as loans for systems, software and services with
terms generally from two to seven years. Global Financings client loans are
primarily for software and services and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit
analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions
are taken to mitigate risks in the loan agreements which include covenants to
protect against credit deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client
financing also includes internal activity as described on page 24 of the
2009 IBM Annual Report.
 
Commercial financing
receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing
for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for
inventory financing and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30
to 90 days.  These short-term receivables
are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit analysis in
order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
At March 31,
2010, substantially all financing assets are IT related assets, and
approximately 60 percent of the external portfolio is with investment grade
clients with no direct exposure to consumers or mortgage assets.

resulted in a net decline in total financing assets for these periods. The
increase in originations was due to improving volumes in commercial financing.
 
Cash
generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany
payables and dividends to IBM.

*   Represents reserved receivables, net of
recoveries, which were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents
translation adjustments.
 
The percentage of Global
Financing receivables reserved increased from 2.1 percent at December 31,
2009 to 2.3 percent at March 31, 2010 primarily due to the seasonal
decline in the gross financing receivables balance from December 31, 2009.  Specific reserves increased 2.1 percent from
$416 million at December 31, 2009 to $425 million at March 31, 2010.
Unallocated reserves decreased $35 million from $120 million at December 31,
2009 to $85 million at March 31, 2010 due to the decline in gross
financing receivables.
 
Global Financings bad
debt expense was an increase of $1 million for the three months ended March 31,
2010, compared with an increase of $71 million for the three months ended March 31,
2009. The decrease in bad debt expense was attributed to the decline of
required specific reserve additions.
 
Residual Value
 
Residual value is
a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease
inception.  Global Financing has insight
into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global Financing
optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of
lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements
with current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from
equipment returned at the end of a lease, represented 40.0 percent of Global
Financings revenue in the first quarter of 2010 and 36.9 percent in the first
quarter of 2009. The percentage increase was primarily driven by the increase
in internal used equipment sales to the Global Technology Services segment and
the decrease in financing revenue.  The
gross margin on these sales was 50.6 percent and 49.9 percent in the first
quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
The following table
presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2010 and March 31,
2010. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31, 2010 is
expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. The residual value guarantee
increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining the
classification of a lease as a sales-type lease or operating lease. The
aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees were $90 million and $106
million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31,
2010 and March 31, 2009, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed
future values at the scheduled end of lease were $4 million and $6 million for
the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31,
2010 and March 31, 2009, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.5
million and $0.8 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and March 31,
2009, respectively.

The
company funds Global Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio
target of approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets
is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany
loans are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency
underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both
assets and debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 56.
 
The
Global Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys
external clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company. As
previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as
if it were a standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to
debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is
included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 55 and in
Segment Information on page 24.
 
In
the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, however, the
external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal
financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest
expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on total company debt.
In this table, intercompany activity includes internal loans and leases at arms
length pricing in support of Global Services long-term contracts and other
internal activity. The company believes these assets should be appropriately
leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business model.

Global
Financing is a segment of the company and therefore, is supported by the
companys overall liquidity position and access to capital markets. Cash generated
by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay intercompany payables and
dividends to the company in order to maintain an appropriate debt-to-equity
ratio.

Looking Forward
 
Global Financings
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financings
assets and new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services
financed to the companys clients and business partners, and substantially all
financing assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business
for future growth. Global Financings offerings are competitive and available
to clients as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access to the
capital markets. Overall, Global Financings originations will be dependent
upon the demand for IT products and services as well as client participation
rates.
 
IBM continues to access
both the short-term commercial paper market and the medium- and long-term debt
markets.  A protracted period where IBM
could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in
originations.
 
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact
the credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore
the level of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 58,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both
through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its
remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each
of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with product
and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business
going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the economy.
