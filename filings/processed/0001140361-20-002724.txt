GLOSSARY


The following terms are frequently used in the text of this report and have the meanings indicated below.


“Used Core” — An automobile part which has previously been used in the operation of a vehicle. Generally, the Used Core is an original equipment (“OE”) automobile part installed by the vehicle manufacturer and subsequently
      removed for replacement. Used Cores contain salvageable parts which are an important raw material in the remanufacturing process. We obtain most Used Cores by providing credits to our customers for Used Cores returned to us under our core exchange
      program. Our customers receive these Used Cores from consumers who deliver a Used Core to obtain credit from our customers upon the purchase of a newly remanufactured automobile part. When sufficient Used Cores are not available from our customers,
      we purchase Used Cores from core brokers, who are in the business of buying and selling Used Cores. The Used Cores purchased from core brokers or returned to us by our customers under the core exchange program, and which have been physically received
      by us, are part of our raw material and work-in-process inventory. Used Cores returned by consumers to our customers but not yet returned to us are classified as contract assets until we physically receive these Used Cores.


“Remanufactured Core” — The Used Core underlying an automobile part that has gone through the remanufacturing process and through that process has become part of a newly remanufactured automobile part. The
        remanufacturing process takes a Used Core, breaks it down into its component parts, replaces those components that cannot be reused and reassembles the salvageable components of the Used Core and additional new components into a remanufactured
        automobile part. Remanufactured Cores held for sale at our customer locations are included in long-term contract assets. The Remanufactured Core portion of stock adjustment returns are classified as contract assets until we physically
      receive them.

1. Company Background and Organization


Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, or “MPA”) is a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket non-discretionary replacement parts and diagnostic equipment. These replacement parts are
        primarily sold to automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout North America and to major automobile manufacturers for both their aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs (“OES”). The Company’s diagnostic
        equipment primarily serves the global automotive component and powertrain testing market. The Company’s products include (i) rotating electrical products such as alternators and starters, (ii) wheel hub assemblies and bearings, (iii) brake
      master cylinders, (iv) brake calipers (introduced in August 2019), and (v) other products. Other products include: (i) brake power boosters, (ii) turbochargers, (iii)
      diagnostics systems, (iv)advanced power emulators, and (v) custom power electronic products. 


The Company primarily ships its products from its facilities and various third party warehouse distribution centers in North America.


Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Statement Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for segment reporting, the Company has identified its chief operating decision maker
      (“CODM”), reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understands how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. The Company has determined through this review process that its business comprises three separate
      operating segments.  Two of the operating segments meet all of the aggregation criteria, and are aggregated. The remaining operating segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds for individual disclosure. Since this immaterial operating segment
      meets the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, the Company has combined its operating segments into one reportable segment.


In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Dixie Electric, Ltd (“Dixie”). During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation of Dixie with no material adjustments.


2. Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Pronouncements


Basis of Presentation


The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.
      Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair
      presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. This report should be read in
      conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (“SEC”) on June 28, 2019.


The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consistent basis with, and there have been no material changes to, except as noted below, the accounting policies described in Note 3, Summary of Significant
      Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements that are presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted


Leases


In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires balance sheet recognition of a lease asset and lease liability by lessees for all leases, other than leases with a term of 12 months or less if the short-term lease exclusion expedient
      is elected. The new guidance also requires new disclosures providing additional qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The new guidance requires a modified retrospective approach with optional
      practical expedients. The FASB provided entities with an additional transition method, which allows an entity to apply this guidance as of the beginning of the period of adoption instead of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
      in the entity’s financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance on April 1, 2019 using the additional transition method. The Company also elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including the package of
      practical expedients, which allowed it not to reassess lease classification for leases that commenced prior to the adoption date. In addition, the Company elected to exempt leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from balance sheet
      recognition and, for all classes of assets, combining non-lease components with lease components.


Upon adoption, the Company recorded operating lease liabilities of $53,043,000 and corresponding operating lease assets of $50,773,000. The difference between the operating lease assets and liabilities recognized on the Company’s condensed
      consolidated balance sheets primarily related to accrued rent on existing leases that were offset against the operating lease asset upon adoption. There was an immaterial reclassification of non-lease components to finance lease assets and finance
      lease liabilities upon adoption due to the Company’s election to combine non-lease components with lease components. The adoption of the new guidance did not have any impact on the Company’s rent expense and condensed consolidated statement of cash
      flows. However, the Company has material nonfunctional currency leases that could have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. As required for other monetary liabilities, lessees shall remeasure a foreign
      currency-denominated lease liability using the exchange rate at each reporting date, but the lease assets are nonmonetary assets measured at historical rates, which are not affected by subsequent changes in the exchange rates. The Company recorded
      gains of $2,128,000 and $1,491,000 in general and administrative expenses in connection with the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 9 for
      additional discussion of the adoption of ASC 842 and the impact on the Company’s financial statements.


New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted


Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments


In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. This pronouncement, along with a subsequent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued to clarify certain provisions
      of the new guidance, changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected
      credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This pronouncement is effective for
      fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company plans to adopt this pronouncement for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
      adoption of this guidance and it is currently not expected to have any material impact on its consolidated financial statements, business processes, systems and internal controls.


Fair Value Measurements


In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance, which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by
        removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
        2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.




10


Table of Contents


Income Taxes


In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application. This
      guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

7. Debt


The Company is party to a $230,000,000 senior secured financing, (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, consisting of (i) a $200,000,000
      revolving loan facility, subject to borrowing base restrictions, a $20,000,000 sublimit for borrowings by Canadian borrowers, and a $15,000,000 sublimit for letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $30,000,000 term loan facility (the
      “Term Loans”). The loans under the Credit Facility mature on June 5, 2023. The Credit Facility permits the payment of up to $20,000,000 of dividends and share repurchases per fiscal year, subject to a minimum availability threshold and pro forma
      compliance with financial covenants. In connection with the Credit Facility, the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.


In June 2019, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment, among other things, (i) increased the total size of the Revolving Facility to $238,620,000, (ii) modified the fixed
      charge coverage ratio financial covenant, (iii) modified the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”, (iv) modified the borrowing base definition to, among other things, include brake-related products as eligible inventory, (v) increased the letter of
      credit sublimit to $20,000,000, (vi) increased the Canadian revolving sublimit and swing line sublimit to $24,000,000, (vii) increased the swing line sublimit to $23,862,000, (viii) permitted up to $5,000,000 of sale and lease back transactions per
      fiscal year, (ix) increased the permitted amount of certain capital expenditures, (x) increased the permitted amount of operating lease obligations per fiscal year, and (xi) increased certain other covenant-related baskets. The Company capitalized $973,000 of new debt issuance costs in connection with the Second Amendment, which is included in prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019.


The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $937,500 beginning October 1, 2018. The Credit Facility bears interest at rates equal to either LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%, 2.50% or 2.75% or a reference rate plus a margin of 1.25%, 1.50%
      or 1.75%, in each case depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. There is also a facility fee of 0.375% to 0.50%, depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The interest rate on
      the Company’s Term Loans and Revolving Facility was 4.45% and 4.55%, at December 31, 2019, respectively, and 5.24% at March 31, 2019.


The Credit Facility, among other things, requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with
      all financial covenants at December 31, 2019.

Table of Contents

In addition to other covenants, the Credit Facility places limits on the Company’s ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset
      sales, redeem or repurchase capital stock, alter the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, transact with affiliates, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt, and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements.


The following summarizes information about the Term Loans at:





Future repayments of the Term Loans are as follows:





The Company had $130,000,000 and $110,400,000 outstanding under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. In addition, $4,039,000 was outstanding for letters of credit at December 31,
      2019. At December 31, 2019, after certain contractual adjustments, $73,767,000 was available under the Revolving Facility.


8. Contract Liabilities


Contract liabilities are comprised of the following:

Table of Contents

9. Leases


The Company leases various facilities in North America and Asia under operating leases expiring through December 2032. The Company has one non-cancellable lease agreement for a building in Mexico, which was executed, but had not commenced as of
      December 31, 2019, and accordingly was not included in the operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019. Total commitments for the 15-year lease term of this agreement are $11,722,000. The Company also has finance
      leases for certain office and manufacturing equipment, which generally range from three to five years.


The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Lease assets and lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, which includes the minimum unconditional term of the lease.
      Certain of the Company’s leases include options to extend the leases for up to five years.  When the Company has the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is
      reasonably certain that it will exercise the option, the option is considered in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. The lease assets are recorded net of any lease incentives received. Lease assets are tested for impairment
      in the same manner as long-lived assets used in operations.


As the rate implicit for each of its leases is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the lease commencement date, for each of its leases in determining the present value of
      its expected lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is determined by analyzing and combining an applicable risk-free rate, a financial spread adjustment and any lease specific adjustment. Certain leases contain provisions for
      property-related costs that are variable in nature for which the Company is responsible, including common area maintenance and other property operating services, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the determination of lease assets and
      lease liabilities. These costs are calculated based on a variety of factors including property values, tax and utility rates, property services fees, and other factors. The Company records rent expense for operating leases, some of which have
      escalating rent payments, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.


Balance sheet information for leases is as follows:

Maturities of lease commitments at December 31, 2019 were as follows:





Other information about leases is as follows:





10. Accounts Receivable Discount Programs


The Company uses receivable discount programs with certain customers and their respective banks. Under these programs, the Company may sell those customers’ receivables to those banks at a discount to be agreed upon at the time the receivables are
      sold. These discount arrangements allow the Company to accelerate receipt of payment on customers’ receivables.




16


Table of Contents

The following is a summary of accounts receivable discount programs:





11. Net Income (Loss) Per Share


Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the effect, if any, from the potential
      exercise or conversion of securities, such as stock options and warrants, which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common stock to the extent the effect is not anti-dilutive.


The following presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:





Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted net income per share or decreasing diluted net loss per share are considered to be anti-dilutive and as such, these shares are not included in calculating diluted net income
      (loss) per share. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 1,047,224 and 1,519,480, respectively, of potential common shares not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because their effect was
      anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 1,031,624 and 1,519,480, respectively, of potential common shares not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because their effect was
      anti-dilutive.


12. Income Taxes


The Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,502,000, or an effective tax rate of 63.5%, and an income tax benefit of $1,035,000, or an effective tax rate of 25.0%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and
        2018, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,752,000, or an effective tax rate of 66.0%, and an income tax benefit of $1,301,000, or an effective tax rate of 20.4%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
      respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, were primarily impacted by specific jurisdictions that the Company does not expect to recognize benefit of losses. The effective tax rate is based on current
      projections and any changes in future periods could result in an effective tax rate that is materially different from the current estimate.


The Company remains subject to examination for the fiscal years beginning with March 31, 2017. The Company believes no significant changes in the unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next 12 months.

13. Financial Risk Management and Derivatives


Purchases and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which are primarily related to the Company’s overseas facilities, expose the Company to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S.
      dollar and the foreign currencies. The Company’s primary risk exposure is from fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent the Chinese yuan. To mitigate these risks, the Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange
      contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for these foreign currencies. The extent to which forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to the Company’s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of
      anticipated requirements.


The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation. The use of derivative financial instruments allows the Company to reduce
      its exposure to the risk that the eventual cash outflow resulting from funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies. The Company does not
      hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are designated for forecasted expenditure requirements to fund foreign operations.


The Company had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with a U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of $40,645,000 and $32,524,000 at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. These contracts generally have a term of one year or
      less, at rates agreed at the inception of the contracts. The counterparty to this derivative transaction is a major financial institution with investment grade credit rating; however, the Company is exposed to credit risk with this institution. The
      credit risk is limited to the potential unrealized gains (which offset currency fluctuations adverse to the Company) in any such contract should this counterparty fail to perform as contracted. Any changes in the fair values of forward foreign
      currency exchange contracts are reflected in current period earnings and accounted for as an increase or offset to general and administrative expenses.


The following shows the effect of derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of operations:





The fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts of $1,223,000 and $207,000 is included in prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The
      changes in the fair values of forward foreign currency exchange contracts are included in prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2019. The changes in the fair
      values of forward foreign currency exchange contracts are included in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.

Table of Contents

14. Fair Value Measurements


The following summarizes financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, by level within the fair value hierarchy:





Short-term Investments and Deferred Compensation


The Company’s short-term investments, which fund its deferred compensation liabilities, consist of investments in mutual funds. These investments are classified as Level 1 as the shares of these mutual funds trade with sufficient frequency and
      volume to enable the Company to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.


Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts


The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers (See Note 13).


Contingent Consideration


In December 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities from Mechanical Power Conversion, LLC (“E&M”). In connection with this acquisition, the Company is contingently obligated to make
      additional payments to the former owners of E&M up to an aggregate of $5,200,000 over the next three years. 


In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of all the equity interests of Dixie. In connection with this acquisition, the Company is contingently obligated to make additional payments to the former owners of Dixie up to $1,130,000 over
      the next two years. 


The Company’s contingent consideration is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in its condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, and is a Level 3 liability measured at fair value.


E&M Research and Development (“R&D”) Event Milestone


The fair value of the two-year R&D event milestone based on technology development and transfer was $2,430,000 at December 31, 2019 determined using a probability weighted method with the following assumptions commensurate with the term of the
      contingent consideration: Any subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability will be recorded in current period earnings as a general and administrative expense.




19


Table of Contents

The assumptions used to determine the fair value is as follows:





E&M Gross Profit Earn-out Consideration


The fair value of the three-year gross profit earn-out consideration was $1,980,000 at December 31, 2019 determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model. Any subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability will be
      recorded in current period earnings as a general and administrative expense.


The assumptions used to determine the fair value is as follows:





Dixie Revenue Earn-out Consideration


The fair value of the two-year revenue earn-out consideration was $751,000 at December 31, 2019 determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model.


The assumptions used to determine the fair value is as follows:





Any subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability will be recorded in current period earnings as a general and administrative expense.


The following table summarizes the activity for financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 fair value measurements:





During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company had no other significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.




20


Table of Contents

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the revolving loan, term loan
      and other long-term liabilities approximate their fair value based on the variable nature of interest rates and current rates for instruments with similar characteristics.


15. Share-based Payments


Stock Options


The Company granted options to purchase 302,539 and 256,236 shares of common stock during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cost associated with stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
      model. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected holding period of the option. These subjective assumptions are based on both historical and other information.
      Changes in the values assumed and used in the model can materially affect the estimate of fair value.


The following assumptions were used to derive the weighted average fair value of the stock options granted:

Warranty Returns


The Company allows its customers to return goods that their consumers have returned to them, whether or not the returned item is defective (“warranty returns”). The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to
          warranty returns based on a historical analysis of the level of this type of return as a percentage of total unit sales. Amounts charged to expense for these warranty returns are considered in arriving at the Company’s net sales.

Contingencies


The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations have the ability to conduct periodic examinations of and administrative proceedings regarding the Company’s business.
          Following an audit in fiscal 2019, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that it believed that the Company owed additional duties of approximately $17 million from 2011 through mid-2018 relating to products that it imported from Mexico. 
          The Company does not believe that this amount is correct and believes that it has numerous defenses and intends to dispute this amount vigorously.  The Company cannot assure that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will agree or that it will
          not need to accrue or pay additional amounts in the future.

Management Overview


We have successfully implemented a multi-pronged platform for growth within the non-discretionary automotive aftermarket for replacement parts, through organic growth and acquisitions. We expect growth to continue and as a result, we are
          investing to increase our infrastructure. Our investments in infrastructure and human resources include the consolidation of our distribution in Mexico and the significant expansion of manufacturing capacity in both Mexico and Malaysia. Once
          complete, we expect this to be transformative and scalable.


In addition, we are expanding our position within the diagnostic testing industry with applications for internal combustion engines, electric vehicles, and applications for the aerospace industry.


Our products include (i) rotating electrical products such as alternators and starters, (ii) wheel hub assemblies and bearings, (iii) brake master cylinders, (iv) brake calipers (introduced in August 2019), and (v) other products. Other
          products include: (i) brake power boosters, (ii) turbochargers, (iii) diagnostics systems, (iv) advanced power emulators, and (v) custom power electronic products.

Table of Contents

Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for segment reporting, we have identified our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”),
          reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understand how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. We have determined through this review process that due to recent acquisitions, our business comprises
          three separate operating segments.  Two of the operating segments meet all of the aggregation criteria, and are aggregated. The remaining operating segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds for individual disclosure. Since this immaterial
          operating segment meets the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, we have combined our operating segments into one reportable segment.


Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018


The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.


The following summarizes certain key operating data:





 





(1)

Annualized finished goods turnover for the fiscal quarter is calculated by multiplying cost of goods sold for the quarter by 4 and dividing the result by the average between beginning and ending finished goods inventory values,
                      which includes all on-hand core inventory, for the fiscal quarter. We believe this provides a useful measure of our ability to turn our inventory into revenues.







Net Sales and Gross Profit


The following summarizes net sales and gross profit:





Net Sales. Our net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $1,461,000, or 1.2%, to $125,574,000 compared to net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018 of
          $124,113,000. In August 2019, we expanded our automotive aftermarket brake product offerings with the introduction of brake calipers, which contributed net sales of $6,883,000 during the third quarter. In addition, our net sales were positively
          impacted by $6,133,000 from acquisitions completed during the latter part of fiscal 2019. Sales for the quarter were impacted by lower replenishment orders in the latter part of the quarter
            and certain customer inventory reduction initiatives.



Gross Profit. Our gross profit was $27,661,000, or 22.0% of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with $21,161,000, or 17.0% of net sales for the
            three months ended December 31, 2018. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was higher by 5.0% primarily due to a change in product mix and the non-cash quarterly revaluation of cores that are part of
              the finished goods on the customers’ shelves (which are included in contract assets) to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These quarterly revaluations resulted in a write-down of $2,395,000, which impacted gross margin by 1.9%,
              compared with $2,619,000, which impacted gross margin by 2.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.



25


Table of Contents

Our gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was further impacted by (i) transition expenses in connection with the expansion of our operations into Mexico of $2,148,000 and $2,078,000,
              respectively, (ii) amortization of core buy-back premiums paid to customers related to new business of $1,326,000 and $1,051,000, respectively, and (iii) customer allowances and return accruals related to new business of $777,000 and
              $1,710,000, respectively. In addition, our gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by (i) net tariff costs of $1,526,000 paid for products sold before price increases were effective and (ii) core sales of $7,753,000, less related cost of goods sold of $7,750,000, and a cost of $767,000 incurred in connection with the cancellation of a customer contract.



Operating Expenses


The following summarizes operating expenses:





General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2019 were $10,618,000, which represents a decrease of $1,713,000, or 13.9%, from general and
          administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 of $12,331,000. This decrease was due to (i) a non-cash $1,644,000 gain compared with a non-cash loss of $860,000 recorded due to the change in the fair value of the forward
          foreign currency exchange contracts during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and (ii) a non-cash gain of $2,128,000 due to the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during the three months
          ended December 31, 2019. These decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by (i) $816,000 of increased employee-related expenses incurred in connection with our growth initiatives, (ii) $848,000 of general and
          administrative expenses attributable to our fiscal 2019 acquisitions, (iii) $476,000 of increased expense in connection with our internal controls remediation efforts,(iv) $247,000 of increased professional services, (v) $279,000 of increased
          general and administrative expenses at our offshore locations, (vi) $199,000 of increased depreciation expense, and (vii) $165,000 of increased amortization of intangible assets in connection with our fiscal 2019 acquisitions.


Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses for the three months December 31, 2019 increased $474,000, or 9.2%, to $5,623,000 from $5,149,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2018
          primarily due to $731,000 of sales and marketing expenses attributable to our fiscal 2019 acquisitions and $217,000 for personnel to support our growth initiatives. These increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by (i)
          $231,000 of decreased marketing expense in connection with new business, (ii) $145,000 of decreased trade shows expenses, and (iii) $62,000 of decreased commissions.


Research and Development. Our research and development expenses increased by $120,000, or 5.8%, to $2,174,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 from $2,054,000 for the three months ended
          December 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to $260,000 of research and development expenses attributable to our fiscal 2019 acquisitions partially offset by $115,000 of decreased supplies.

Interest Expense


Interest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2019 increased $1,115,000, or 19.3%, to $6,879,000 from $5,764,000
            for the three months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased average outstanding borrowings in connection with our growth initiatives. In addition, interest expense for the three months
          ended December 31, 2019 was higher due to increased utilization of our accounts receivable discount programs, which was partially offset by a lower weighted average discount rate on these programs during the period.


Provision for Income Taxes


Income Tax. We recorded an income tax expense of $1,502,000, or an effective tax rate of 63.5%, and an income tax benefit of $1,035,000, or an effective tax
            rate of 25.0%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates were primarily impacted by specific jurisdictions that we do not expect to recognize benefit of losses. The effective tax rate is based on current projections and any changes in future periods could result in an effective tax rate that is materially different from the current estimate.


Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018


The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.


The following summarizes certain key operating data:











(1)

Annualized finished goods turnover for the fiscal period is calculated by multiplying cost of goods sold for the period by 1.3 and dividing the result by the average between beginning and ending finished goods inventory values,
                      which includes all on-hand core inventory, for the period. We believe this provides a useful measure of our ability to turn our inventory into revenues.







Net Sales and Gross Profit


The following summarizes net sales and gross profit:





Net Sales. Our net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 increased by $41,376,000, or 12.0%, to $385,096,000 compared to net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 of
          $343,720,000, reflecting continued growth across all of our product lines. In addition, our net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 were positively impacted by (i) $17,284,000 from acquisitions completed during the latter part of
          fiscal 2019 and (ii) our expansion of automotive aftermarket brake product offerings with the introduction of brake calipers in August 2019, which contributed net sales of $11,455,000.



27


Table of Contents


Gross Profit. Our gross profit was $81,817,000, or 21.2% of net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $63,224,000, or 18.4% of net sales for the nine
            months ended December 31, 2018. The gross profit margin increase of 2.8% was due primarily to a change in product mix and the non-cash quarterly
              revaluation of cores that are part of the finished goods on the customers’ shelves (which are included in contract assets) to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These quarterly revaluations resulted in a write-down of $9,867,000,
              which impacted gross margin by 2.6%, compared with $11,466,000, which impacted gross margin by 3.3%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.



Our gross profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was further impacted by (i) transition expenses in connection with the expansion of our operations
          into Mexico of $5,829,000 and $5,666,000, respectively, (ii) amortization of core buy-back premiums paid to customers related to new business of $3,543,000 and $3,033,000, respectively, (iii) customer allowances and return accruals related to new
          business of $1,119,000 and $4,083,000, respectively, and (iv) net tariff costs of $1,067,000 and $1,526,000, respectively, which were paid for products sold before price increases were effective. Gross profit for the nine months ended December
          31, 2019 was further impacted by a cost of $133,000 incurred in connection with the cancellation of a customer contract. In addition, gross profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 was
          impacted by core sales of $7,753,000, less related cost of goods sold of $7,750,000, and a cost of $767,000 incurred in connection with the cancellation of a customer contract.


Operating Expenses


The following summarizes operating expenses:





General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 were $36,903,000, which represents an increase of $3,484,000, or 10.4%, from general and
          administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 of $33,419,000. This increase was due to (i) $2,196,000 of general and administrative expenses attributable to our fiscal 2019 acquisitions, (ii) $1,525,000 of increased
          professional services, (iii) $1,197,000 for personnel to support our growth initiatives, (iv) $965,000 of increased expense in connection with our internal control remediation efforts, (v) $769,000 of increased amortization of intangible assets
          in connection with our fiscal 2019 acquisitions, (vi) $557,000 of increased general and administrative expenses at our offshore locations to support our growth initiatives, and (vii) $473,000 of increased depreciation expense. These increases in
          general and administrative expenses were partially offset by (i) a non-cash $1,016,000 gain compared with a non-cash loss of $1,628,000 recorded due to the change in the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts during the
          nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and (ii) a non-cash gain of $1,491,000 due to the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during the nine months ended December 31, 2019.


Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 increased $1,912,000, or 13.6%, to $15,990,000 from $14,078,000 for the nine months ended December 31,
          2018. This increase was due to (i) $1,983,000 of sales and marketing expenses attributable to our fiscal 2019 acquisitions, (ii) $639,000 for personnel to support our growth initiatives, and (iii) $177,000 of increased commissions. These
          increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by $425,000 of decreased trade shows expenses and $377,000 of decreased marketing expense in connection with new business.

Table of Contents

Research and Development. Our research and development expenses increased by $1,120,000, or 20.1%, to $6,694,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 from $5,574,000 for the nine months ended
          December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to (i) $710,000 of research and development expenses attributable to our fiscal 2019 acquisitions and (ii) $477,000 for personnel to support our growth initiatives. These increases were partially
          offset by $147,000 of decreased supplies.


Interest Expense


Interest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 increased $3,037,000, or 18.4%, to $19,575,000 from
            $16,538,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased average outstanding borrowings in connection with our growth initiatives and as we build our inventory levels to
          support anticipated higher sales. The increased utilization of our accounts receivable discount programs was mostly offset by a decrease in the weighted average discount rate from these programs.


Provision for Income Taxes


Income Tax. We recorded an income tax expense of $1,752,000, or an effective tax rate of 66.0%, and an income tax benefit of $1,301,000, or an effective tax
            rate of 20.4%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates were primarily impacted by specific jurisdictions that we do not expect to recognize benefit of losses. The effective tax rate is based on current projections and any changes in future periods could result in an effective tax rate that is materially different from the current estimate.


Liquidity and Capital Resources


Overview


We had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of $75,094,000 and $73,528,000, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.3:1.0 at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.


We generated cash during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 from the use of receivable discount programs as well as from our credit facility. The cash generated from these activities was primarily used for our growth initiatives and to
          build our inventory levels to support anticipated higher sales.


In June 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility, which, among other things, increased our revolving loan facility from $200,000,000 to $238,620,000.


We believe our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, use of receivable discount programs, amounts available under our credit facility, and other sources are sufficient to satisfy our expected future working capital needs,
          repayment of the current portion of our term loans, and lease and capital expenditure obligations over the next 12 months.


Share Repurchase Program


As of December 31, 2019, $15,692,000 of the $37,000,000 authorized share repurchase program had been utilized and $21,308,000 remained available to repurchase shares, subject to the limit in our credit facility. Our credit facility permits the
          payment of up to $20,000,000 of dividends and share repurchases per fiscal year, subject to a minimum availability threshold and pro forma compliance with financial covenants. We retired the 675,561 shares repurchased under this program through
          December 31, 2019. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions.

Cash Flows


The following summarizes cash flows as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:





Net cash used in operating activities was $4,410,000 and $20,328,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The changes in our cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 as
          compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were due primarily to increased operating results (net income plus the net add-back for non-cash transactions in earnings). In addition, our cash flows used in operating activities continue to
          be significantly impacted by our growth initiatives, including our product line expansion, and our inventory levels. 


Net cash used in investing activities was $9,650,000 and $13,244,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due primarily to our December 2018 acquisition. In addition, during the nine months ended December 31,
          2019, we redeemed short-term investments, which was partially offset by increased purchases of equipment for our current operations and the expansion of our operations in Mexico.


Net cash provided by financing activities was $13,546,000 and $29,290,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due mainly to lower net borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, during the nine months
          ended December 31, 2018 we used $4,062,000 for share repurchases.


Capital Resources


Credit Facility


We are a party to a $230,000,000 senior secured financing, (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, consisting of (i) a $200,000,000
          revolving loan facility, subject to borrowing base restrictions, a $20,000,000 sublimit for borrowings by Canadian borrowers, and a $15,000,000 sublimit for letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $30,000,000 term loan facility
          (the “Term Loans”). The loans under the Credit Facility mature on June 5, 2023. The Credit Facility permits the payment of up to $20,000,000 of dividends and share repurchases per fiscal year, subject to a minimum availability threshold and pro
          forma compliance with financial covenants. In connection with the Credit Facility, the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets.


In June 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment, among other things, (i) increased the total size of the Revolving Facility to $238,620,000, (ii) modified the fixed charge
          coverage ratio financial covenant, (iii) modified the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”, (iv) modified the borrowing base definition to, among other things, include brake-related products as eligible inventory, (v) increased the letter of
          credit sublimit to $20,000,000, (vi) increased the Canadian revolving sublimit and swing line sublimit to $24,000,000, (vii) increased the swing line sublimit to $23,862,000, (viii) permitted up to $5,000,000 of sale and lease back transactions
          per fiscal year, (ix) increased the permitted amount of certain capital expenditures, (x) increased the permitted amount of operating lease obligations per fiscal year, and (xi) increased certain other covenant-related baskets. We capitalized $973,000 of new debt issuance costs in connection with the Second Amendment, which is included in prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019.

The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $937,500 beginning October 1, 2018. The Credit Facility bears interest at rates equal to either LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%, 2.50% or 2.75% or a reference rate plus a margin of 1.25%,
          1.50% or 1.75%, in each case depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. There is also a facility fee of 0.375% to 0.50%, depending on the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The interest
          rate on our Term Loans and Revolving Facility was 4.45% and 4.55% at December 31, 2019, respectively, and 5.24% at March 31, 2019.


The Credit Facility, among other things, requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum senior leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial
          covenants as of December 31, 2019.


The following summarizes the financial covenants required under the Credit Facility:





In addition to other covenants, the Credit Facility places limits on our ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales,
          redeem or repurchase capital stock, alter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries, transact with affiliates, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt, and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements.


We had $130,000,000 and $110,400,000 outstanding under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. In addition, $4,039,000 was outstanding for letters of credit at December 31, 2019. At
          December 31, 2019, after certain contractual adjustments, $73,767,000 was available under the Revolving Facility.


Receivable Discount Programs


We use receivable discount programs with certain customers and their respective banks. Under these programs, we have options to sell those customers’ receivables to those banks at a discount to be agreed upon at the time the receivables are
          sold. These discount arrangements allow us to accelerate receipt of payment on customers’ receivables. While these arrangements have reduced our working capital needs, there can be no assurance that these programs will continue in the future.
          Interest expense resulting from these programs would increase if interest rates rise, if utilization of these discounting arrangements expands, if customers extend their payment to us, or if the discount period is extended to reflect more
          favorable payment terms to customers.


The following is a summary of the receivable discount programs:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


At December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for
          purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.


Capital Expenditures and Commitments


Capital Expenditures


Our total capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $13,231,000 and $8,755,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These capital expenditures primarily include the purchase of equipment for our
          current operations and the expansion of our operations in Mexico. We expect to incur approximately $6,000,000 of capital expenditures for our current operations and approximately $12,000,000 for continued expansion of our operations in Mexico
          during fiscal 2020. We have used and expect to continue using our working capital and additional capital lease obligations to fund these capital expenditures.

New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted


Leases


In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires balance sheet recognition of a lease asset and lease liability by lessees for all leases, other than leases with a term of 12 months or less if the short-term lease exclusion
          expedient is elected. The new guidance also requires new disclosures providing additional qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The new guidance requires a modified retrospective approach
          with optional practical expedients. The FASB provided entities with an additional transition method, which allows an entity to apply this guidance as of the beginning of the period of adoption instead of the beginning of the earliest comparative
          period presented in the entity’s financial statements. We adopted this guidance on April 1, 2019 using the additional transition method. We also elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including the package
          of practical expedients, which allowed us not to reassess lease classification for leases that commenced prior to the adoption date. In addition, we elected to exempt leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from balance sheet recognition
          and, for all classes of assets, combining non-lease components with lease components.


Upon adoption, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $53,043,000 and corresponding operating lease assets of $50,773,000. The difference between the operating lease assets and liabilities recognized on our condensed consolidated balance
          sheet primarily related to accrued rent on existing leases that were offset against the operating lease asset upon adoption. There was an immaterial reclassification of non-lease components to finance lease assets and finance lease liabilities
          upon adoption due to our election to combine non-lease components with lease components. The adoption of the new guidance did not have any impact on our rent expense and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. However, we have material
          nonfunctional currency leases that could have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As required for other monetary liabilities, lessees shall remeasure a foreign currency-denominated lease liability using the
          exchange rate at each reporting date, but the lease assets are nonmonetary assets measured at historical rates, which are not affected by subsequent changes in the exchange rates. We recorded recorded gains of $2,128,000 and $1,491,000 in general
          and administrative expenses in connection with the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 9 for additional discussion of the adoption of ASC
          842 and the impact on our financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted


Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments


In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. This pronouncement, along with a subsequent ASU issued to clarify certain provisions of the new guidance, changes
          the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such
          instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and
          for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning April 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance and it is
          currently not expected to have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements, business processes, systems and internal controls.


Fair Value Measurements


In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance, which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by
            removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
            2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.


Income Taxes


In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application.
          This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.



 


Item 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk







There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of March 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on
          June 28, 2019.



 


Item 4.

Controls and Procedures







Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Chief Accounting Officer (“CAO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
          (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2019. Based on this evaluation, our CEO, CFO and CAO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
          at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2019 as a result of the material weakness described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and below.
 

A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or
          interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Table of Contents

As disclosed in more detail in Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we identified the following material weakness in internal control over
          financial reporting:
 





 
(1)

We did not perform a sufficient review of certain accounting policies and lacked oversight of the compliance with those policies, which resulted in inconsistent application, inadequate analysis and deficient
                      documentation to support the financial statement presentation and disclosures over certain accounts, including inventory.













(2)

Our lack of sufficient technical accounting resources resulted in inadequate oversight of process level controls of one of our subsidiaries.







Management’s Remediation Efforts
 

We have designed and begun to implement several steps, as further described below, to remediate the material weakness described in this Item 4 and enhance our overall control environment.
 




 

1.


Management has hired additional finance and accounting personnel with the requisite experience and skill levels, supplemented by third-party technical accounting resources, sufficient to enable the
                      proper and timely review of accounting analyses and memos in various technical areas.









 

2.


Management will continue to formalize the assessment and documentation of the Company’s accounting and financial reporting policies and procedures and enhance controls over the monitoring of
                      compliance with those accounting policies and procedures.









 

3.


Management will enhance the accounting and internal control training program provided to staff of new and existing subsidiaries. Management will enhance its internal control processes to
                      continuously monitor the subsidiaries’ compliance with and documentation of the Company’s accounting and financial reporting policies and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting.









 

4.


Management has enhanced and will continue to enhance the risk assessment process and design of internal control over financial reporting at its subsidiary.




 

The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing review by our management, including our CEO, CFO and CAO, as well as Audit Committee oversight. Management expects the remediation plan to extend over multiple
          financial reporting periods throughout fiscal year 2020. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that
          these controls are operating effectively. We currently expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2020.


While the foregoing measures are intended to effectively remediate the material weakness described in this Item 4, it is possible that additional remediation steps will be necessary. As such, as we continue to evaluate
          and implement our plan to remediate the material weakness, management may decide to take additional measures to address the material weakness or modify the remediation steps described above. Until the material weakness is remediated, we plan to
          continue to perform additional analyses and other procedures to help ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
 

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
          accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.
 


34


Table of Contents


Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
 


1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
 

2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
          of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
 

3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
          controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 

We are taking actions to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal controls over financial reporting, as described above. Except as discussed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over
          financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
          materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
