Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements
1.               The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto are
unaudited.  In the opinion of the
management of International Business Machines Corporation (the company), these
statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary
to present a fair statement of the companys results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and gains and losses
not affecting retained earnings that are reported in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying disclosures. 
Actual results may be different. 
See the companys 2006 Annual Report for a discussion of the companys
critical accounting estimates.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year.  The information
included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys
2006 Annual Report.
In the first quarter of 2007, the company changed the
presentation of revenue and cost in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings to
reflect the categories of Services, Sales and Financing. Previously, the
presentation included Global Services, Hardware, Software, Global Financing and
an Other category. In the past, these categories were aligned with the companys
reportable segment presentation of external revenue and cost. However, as the
company moves toward delivering solutions which bring integrated software and
services capabilities to its clients, the alignment between segments and
categories will diverge. Therefore, there are situations where the Services
segments could include software revenue, and conversely, the Software segment
may have services revenue. The change was made to avoid possible confusion
between the segment revenue and cost presentation and the required category
presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The change only impacts the format for the
presentation of the companys revenue and cost in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings and does not reflect any change in the companys reportable segment
results or in the companys organizational structure.  The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are
reported on a comparable basis.  The
management discussion and analysis of revenue and gross profit from continuing
operations will focus on the segment view, as this is how the business is
managed and is the best reflection of the companys operating results and
strategy.
Within the financial tables in this Form 10-Q, certain
columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure
purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar
amounts.
2.               In
February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115, which will become effective in 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible
financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on
an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be
accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting
principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent
changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings.  The company will adopt this Statement in
fiscal year 2008 and is currently evaluating if it will elect the fair value
option for any of its eligible financial instruments and other items.
In September 2006, the
FASB finalized SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which will become
effective in 2008. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements;
however, it does not require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of
SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively to fair value measurements and
disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and is not expected to have
a material effect on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the first
quarter of 2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of
Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, that provides
guidance on accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 156, separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially
measured at fair value, if practicable. Subsequent to initial recognition, the
company may use either the amortization method or the fair value measurement
method to account for servicing assets and servicing liabilities within the
scope of this Statement. The adoption of this Statement did not have a material
effect on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the first quarter of
2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instrumentsan amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140, which
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid
8 


financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.  The adoption of this
Statement did not have a material effect on the companys Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
(FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for
uncertainties in income tax law. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive
model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income
tax returns. See Note 3 below for additional information, including the effects
of adoption on the companys Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
3.               As
highlighted in Note 2 above, the company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on
January 1, 2007.
The cumulative effect of
adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in tax reserves and an increase of $117 million
to the January 1, 2007 Retained earnings balance.  Upon adoption, the liability for income taxes
associated with uncertain tax positions at January 1, 2007 was $2,414 million.  This liability can be reduced by $458 million
of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential
transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.  The net amount of $1,956 million, if
recognized, would favorably affect the companys effective tax rate.  In addition, consistent with the provisions
of FIN 48, the company reclassified $1,971 million of income tax liabilities
from current to non-current liabilities because payment of cash is not
anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These non-current income
tax liabilities are recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position.
Interest and penalties
related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense. The
balance of accrued interest and penalties recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position at January 1, 2007 was $126 million; of this
amount, $95 million was also reclassified from current to non-current
liabilities upon adoption of FIN 48.
With limited exception,
the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2000. During the
first quarter of 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced its audit of
the companys U.S. income tax returns for 2004 and 2005. The company
anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end of 2008.  The company does not anticipate a significant
change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12
months.
For the three month and
six month periods ending June 30, 2007, there were no material changes related
to tax reserves that impacted the companys effective tax rate.

The reduction in
pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended June 30, 2007,
as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was principally the
result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants ($33 million) offset
by an increase related to restricted and performance-based stock units ($9
million).  The reduction in pre-tax
stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2007, as
compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was principally the
result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants ($41 million) and a
reduction related to restricted and performance-based stock units ($6 million).
The effects on stock-based compensation cost due to the divestiture of the
companys Printing Systems Division are included in Other (income) and expense
above and in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the three- and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2007.
As of June 30, 2007, the balance of $1,300 million of
total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested awards is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.
There were no significant
capitalized stock-based compensation costs at June 30, 2007 and 2006.
6.               The
company offers defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension
plans, as well as nonpension postretirement plans primarily consisting of

In 2007, the company
expects to contribute to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans approximately $620
million, which is the legally mandated minimum contribution for the companys
non-U.S. Plans. In the first six months of 2007, the company contributed
approximately $281 million to its non-U.S. Plans, as compared to $1,550 million
contributed in the first six months of 2006.
During the second quarter
of 2007, the company initiated changes to the investment strategy of its U.S.
defined benefit plan:
·                  The 2007 target
asset allocation was modified, primarily by reducing public equity securities
and increasing debt securities from 33 percent to 43 percent of total plan
assets;
·                  Duration of debt
securities was increased; and
11 


·                  The use of
derivatives, including interest rate swaps and swaptions, was increased in the
fixed income portfolio to further mitigate the effects of future interest rate
changes on the level of pension surplus.
These changes are
designed to reduce the potential negative impact that equity markets or
interest rates might have on the funded status of the U.S. defined benefit
pension plan. These changes are not expected to impact the expected long-term
rate of return on assets of 8.0 percent. (See Note V, Retirement-Related Benefits,
pages 107 through 109 in the companys 2006 Annual Report for additional
information).

The company received a
$5.1 million subsidy in the second quarter of 2007 and $14.6 million for the
first six months of 2007 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by
the company to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the
remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the
participants.  For further information
related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 110 in the companys
2006 Annual Report.
In addition, the company
made a $500 million voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. nonpension
postretirement benefit plan in March of 2007. This advance funding is in
addition to ongoing contributions of approximately $400 million that will be
made in 2007 which will be utilized to pay current year benefits. The $500
million contribution will be used to fund benefit payments in future years.
7.               Periodically,
the IBM Board of Directors authorizes funding for use in the companys  common stock repurchase program. The company
repurchases shares on the open market or in private transactions, depending on
market conditions. During the three months ended June 30, 2007, the Board of
Directors authorized $15.0 billion in additional funds for future repurchases
of common stock. This amount was in addition to approximately $1.4 billion for
common stock repurchase remaining from a prior Board authorization. The company
stated that it may repurchase shares on the open market or in private
transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions, depending on
market conditions.
The company completed
open market share repurchases of approximately 20.5 million shares for $2.1
billion during the three months ended June 30, 2007. Additionally, for the
three months ended June 30, 2007, 118.8 million shares were repurchased for
$12.5 billion by IBM International Group, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of
the company (the Foreign Subsidiary) under accelerated share repurchase
agreements with three banks (the Accelerated Repurchase).
12




Pursuant to the
Accelerated Repurchase agreements, executed on May 25, 2007, the Foreign
Subsidiary paid an initial purchase price of $105.18 per share for the
repurchase. The initial purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the
volume weighted average price of IBM common stock over a settlement period of
three months for each of the banks. The adjustment will also reflect certain
other amounts including the banks carrying costs, compensation for ordinary
dividends declared by the company during the settlement period and interest
benefits for receiving the $12.5 billion payment in advance of the anticipated
purchases by each bank of shares in the open market during its settlement
period.  The adjustment amount can be
settled in cash, registered shares or unregistered shares at the Foreign
Subsidiarys option. Under the Accelerated Repurchase agreements, the Foreign
Subsidiary will have a separate settlement with each of the three banks; these
settlements are expected to occur in September 2007, December 2007 and March
2008. Any amounts paid or received by the Foreign Subsidiary under any of the
settlement alternatives in connection with the price adjustment will be
recorded as an adjustment to Stockholders equity in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position on each of the settlement dates.
The Foreign Subsidiary
could be required to deliver a maximum of 356.5 million shares if it elects the
share settlement options. The estimated fair value of the cash settlement and
share settlement alternatives under the Accelerated Repurchase as of June 30,
2007 would result in the receipt of approximately $225 million or 2.1 million
refund shares, respectively, by the Foreign Subsidiary. In comparison, each $1
increase/decrease  in the volume weighted
average share price (average from June 1 to June 30, 2007) would impact these
estimates by approximately $119 million or approximately 1.1 million shares
under the cash settlement and share settlement alternatives, respectively. For
the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007, the effect of the share
settlement alternatives would have been antidilutive, and, therefore, were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the respective
periods.
On May 25, 2007, the
Foreign Subsidiary entered into a 364-day, $11.5 billion floating rate Term
Loan Agreement with a number of financial institutions in order to finance the
Accelerated Repurchase. This debt issuance is recorded in Short-term debt in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
8.               During
the first six months ended June 30, 2007, the company completed four
acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $251 million. All four of the acquisitions
were completed in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the company
announced two acquisitions, Telelogic AB and Watchfire Corporation. The
Watchfire acquisition closed in July and the Telelogic acquisition is expected
to close in the fourth quarter. Both acquisitions will be integrated into the
companys software segment.
The Software segment
completed two acquisitions in the first quarter:  Consul Risk Management International BV. and
Vallent Corporation, both privately held companies. Each acquisition further
complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of product offerings.
Global Technology
Services (GTS) completed two acquisitions in the first quarter: Softek Storage
Solutions Corporation  and DM Information
Systems, Ltd. (DMIS), both privately held companies. Softek augments the
companys unified data mobility offerings and worldwide delivery expertise for
managing data in storage array, host and virtualized IT environments. DMIS will
enhance and complement the companys Technology Service offerings.
Purchase price
consideration was paid all in cash. These acquisitions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.

price allocations as of June 30, 2007.

The acquisitions were
accounted for as purchase transactions, and accordingly, the assets and
liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that generated the
goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired companies and IBM
and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify as an
amortizable intangible asset. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax
purposes. The overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable
intangible assets acquired is 3.6 years. With the exception of goodwill, these
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Goodwill of $249 million was  assigned to the Software ($185 million) and
Global Technology Services ($64 million) segments.
9.               In
January 2007, the company announced an agreement with Ricoh Company Limited (Ricoh),
a publicly traded company, to form a joint venture company based on IBMs
Printing System Division (a division of the Systems and Technology
segment).  See Note X, Subsequent Events
in the companys 2006 Annual Report.
The company
initially created a wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoPrint Solutions
(InfoPrint),  by contributing specific
assets and liabilities from its printer business.  The companys Printing System Division
generated approximately $1 billion of revenue in 2006. The InfoPrint portfolio
includes solutions for production printing for enterprises and commercial
printers as well as solutions for office workgroup environments and industrial
segments. On June 1, 2007 (closing date), the company divested 51 percent of
its interest in InfoPrint to Ricoh.  The
company will divest its remaining 49 percent ownership to Ricoh quarterly over
the next three years.
The total
consideration the company agreed to on January 24, 2007 (the date the
definitive agreement was signed) was $725 million which was paid in cash to the
company on the closing date.  The cash
received was consideration for the initial 51 percent acquisition of InfoPrint
by Ricoh as well as a prepayment for the remaining 49 percent to be acquired
and certain royalties and services to be provided by the company to
InfoPrint.  Final consideration for this
transaction will be determined at the end of the three-year period based upon
the participation in the profits and losses recorded by the equity partners.
The company evaluated its ownership and participation in InfoPrint under the
requirements of FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The
company concluded that InfoPrint meets the requirements of a variable interest
entity, the company is not the primary beneficiary of the entity and that deconsolidation
of the applicable net assets was appropriate. The companys investment in
InfoPrint will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The company will
provide maintenance services for one year, certain hardware products for three
years and other information technology and business process services to
InfoPrint for up to five years.  The
company assessed the fair value of these arrangements, and, as a result, has
deferred $274 million of the proceeds. 
This amount will be recorded as revenue, primarily in the companys
services segments, as services are provided to InfoPrint.  The deferred amount was recorded in Deferred
income ($129 million current and $145 million non-current) in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.
The royalty
agreements are related to the use of certain of the companys trademarks for up
to ten years.  The company assessed the
fair value of these royalty agreements, and, as a result, has deferred $116
million of the proceeds.  This amount
will be recognized as Intellectual property and custom development income as it
is earned in subsequent periods.  The
14 


deferred amount was
recorded in Deferred income ($41 million current and $75 million non-current)
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Net assets
contributed, transaction related expenses and provisions were $90 million,
resulting in an expected total pre-tax gain of $245 million, of which $81
million was recorded in Other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings in the second quarter of 2007.
The deferred
pre-tax gain of $164 million is primarily related to: (1) the transfer of the
companys remaining 49 percent interest in InfoPrint to Ricoh, and, (2) the
transfer of certain maintenance services employees to InfoPrint.  The company will recognize this amount over a
three year period as the remaining ownership interest is divested and the
employees are transferred.  The pre-tax
gain will be recorded in Other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.  At June 30, 2007,
the deferred amount is recorded in Deferred income ($64 million current and
$100 million non-current) in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$112 million during the first six months of 2007 primarily due to the amortization
of existing intangible asset balances, partially offset by net increases in
software capitalization and acquired 
intangible assets. The aggregate intangible asset amortization expense
was $289 million and $580 million for the second quarter and first six months
of 2007, respectively, versus $266 million and $531 million for the second
quarter and first six months of 2006, respectively. In addition, in the first
six months of 2006, the company retired $450 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.
The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following
at June 30, 2007:

11.   The tables
on pages 61 and 62 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results of the companys
reportable segments consistent with the management system used by the companys
chief operating decision maker. These results are not necessarily a depiction
that is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For example, employee
retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial assumptions on a
country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments based on headcount. A
different result could occur for any segment if actuarial assumptions unique to
each segment were used. Performance measurement is based on income before
income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in part, by management,
both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of
the segments.
12.   The
following table provides a rollforward of the current and non-current liability
balances for actions taken in the following periods: (1) the second quarter of
2005; (2) the fourth-quarter 2002 actions associated with the acquisition of
the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting business; (3) the second-quarter of 2002
associated with the Microelectronics Division and rebalancing of both the
companys workforce and leased space resources; (4) the 2002 actions associated
with the hard disk drive (HDD) business for reductions in workforce,
manufacturing capacity
and space; (5) the actions taken in 1999; and (6) actions that took place prior
to 1994. See the companys 2006 Annual Report, Note R on page 93 for additional
information on the actions taken in 2005.

* The other adjustments column in the table above
principally includes the reclassification of non-current to current and foreign
currency translation adjustments. In addition, during the six-month period
ended June 30, 2007, net adjustments were recorded to (1) increase  previously recorded liabilities for actions
taken prior to 1994 ($5.3 million); (2) reduce previously recorded liabilities
for actions taken in the second quarter of 2005 ($1.2 million), second quarter
2002 ($1.4 million) and fourth-quarter 2002 ($0.4 million). Of the net increase
of $2.3 million, $3.2 million was included in Selling, General and
Administrative expense and a $0.9 million reduction was recorded in Other
(income) and expense. In addition, interest expense (accretion) of $14.8
million was recorded in Selling, General and Administrative expense and $2.0
million was recorded in Other (income) and expense.

13.   The company
is involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings that
arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including
actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property (IP), product
liability, employment, benefits, securities, and environmental matters.  These actions may be commenced by a number of
different constituents, including competitors, partners, clients, current or
former  employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders, and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. The following is a discussion of some of the more
significant legal matters involving the company.
The company is a
defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City,
Utah by The SCO Group. The company removed the case to Federal Court in Utah.
Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of AT&Ts Unix IP
rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair competition, interference
with contract and breach of contract with regard to the companys distribution
of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux. The company has asserted
counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation of the Lanham Act,
unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive trade practices,
breach of the General Public License that governs open source distributions,
promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005, the company
withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and focus the issues
in the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for summary judgment were
heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its decision. A trial
date has not been set.
In May 2005, the
Louisiana Supreme Court denied the companys motion to review and reverse a
Louisiana state courts certification of a nationwide class in a case filed
against the company in 1995. The class consists of certain former employees who
left the company in 1992, and their spouses, claiming damages based on the
companys termination of an education assistance program.  On July 3, 2007, the company and the
plaintiffs filed a proposed class settlement agreement with the 19th Judicial
District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the legal
action was filed.  On
July 24, 2007, the Court gave its preliminary approval of the proposed
settlement pursuant to which IBM would pay certain amounts to eligible
individuals who took or would have taken an education course within a specified
period after departing the company.  If the proposed settlement receives the final
approval of the Court, IBM will also make contributions to support engineering education
for women and minorities.  On October 1, 2007, the Court will hold a
fairness hearing, at which the Court shall consider any objections to the
proposed settlement and determine whether the proposed settlement shall be
granted final approval.
On June 2, 2003, the
company announced that it received notice of a formal, nonpublic investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking information relating
to revenue recognition in 2000 and 2001, primarily concerning certain types of
client transactions. The company believes this investigation arose from a separate
investigation by the SEC of Dollar General Corporation, a client of the companys
Retail Stores Solutions unit, which markets and sells point-of-sale
products.  On January 8, 2004, the
company announced that it received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC
in connection with the staffs investigation of Dollar General
Corporation.  The separate SEC
investigation noted above, relating to the recognition of revenue by the
company in 2000 and 2001, was not the subject of this Wells Notice.
On June 25, 2007, the
company announced that it reached an agreement with the SEC to settle all
issues regarding the above-referenced investigations. IBM has consented,
without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, to entry of an administrative
order by the SEC directing that it cease and desist from committing or causing
any violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws and related
SEC rules. In connection with the agreement, IBM paid an amount into a fund to
be established in connection with the SECs action against Dollar General.  This payment was consistent with a provision
previously established by the company. An IBM employee in the companys Sales
and Distribution unit also has resolved all issues with the SEC relating to the
separate Wells Notice he received in connection with the staffs investigation
of Dollar General.
On June 27, 2005, the
company announced that it had received a request to voluntarily comply with an
informal investigation by the staff of the SEC concerning the companys disclosures
relating to the companys first-quarter 2005 earnings and expensing of equity
compensation. On January 12, 2006, the company announced that it received
notice of a formal, nonpublic investigation by the SEC of this matter.  On June 5, 2007, the company announced that
it reached an agreement with the SEC to settle this investigation.  In connection with the agreement, IBM has
consented, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, to entry of an
administrative order by the SEC directing that IBM cease and desist from
committing or causing any violations of certain of the reporting provisions of
the federal securities laws and related SEC rules. The SECs order contains no
finding of securities fraud or violation of any antifraud provision of the federal
securities laws and related SEC rules. No monetary penalty or fine was imposed
in connection with the resolution of this matter.
17 


In July 2005, two
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York related to the companys disclosures concerning
first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity compensation. Pursuant
to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006, the two lawsuits were
consolidated into a single action captioned In re International Business
Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a corrected
consolidated amended complaint dated May 19, 2006, in which they named the
company and IBMs Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as
defendants and alleged that defendants made certain misrepresentations and
omissions in violation of Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 20, 2006, the Court
denied a Motion to Dismiss that was filed by IBM. On March 12, 2007, the
plaintiffs class was certified; class notifications were mailed on or about
May 30, 2007.
In January 2004,
the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea announced it had brought
criminal bid-rigging charges against several companies, including IBM Korea and
LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and LG Electronics, which has since
been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and had also charged employees of some
of those entities with, among other things, bribery of certain officials of
government-controlled entities in Korea and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM
cooperated fully with authorities in these matters. A number of individuals,
including former IBM Korea and LG IBM employees, were subsequently found guilty
and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM were also required to pay fines. Debarment
orders were imposed at different times, covering a period of no more than a
year from the date of issuance, which barred IBM Korea from doing business
directly with certain government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders
have since expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from
selling products and services to business partners who sold to
government-controlled entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of
Justice and the SEC have both contacted the company in connection with this
matter.
On January 24,
2006, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against IBM in federal court in
San Francisco on behalf of technical support workers whose primary responsibilities
are or were to install and maintain computer software and hardware. The
complaint was subsequently amended on March 13, 2006. The First Amended
Complaint, among other things, adds four additional named plaintiffs and
modifies the definition of the workers purportedly included in the class. The
suit, Rosenburg, et. al., v. IBM, alleges the company failed to pay overtime
wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law, and asserts
violations of various state wage requirements, including recordkeeping and
meal-break provisions. The suit also asserts certain violations of ERISA.
Relief sought includes back wages, corresponding 401(k) and pension plan
credits, interest and attorneys fees. On July 12, 2007, the District Court
granted final approval to a class-wide settlement whereby IBM will pay $65
million plus certain interest for claims asserted by class members, plaintiffs
attorneys fees and administrative costs. Individual payments will be based on
factors, including the class members state of employment, time worked in the
relevant job position and base salary. The charge associated with this
settlement was consistent with a provision previously established by the
company.
On October 23,
2006, the company filed two lawsuits against Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, one in the
Lufkin Division and one in the Tyler Division. 
The Lufkin suit alleged that Amazon unlawfully infringed three IBM
patents. The Tyler suit alleged that Amazon unlawfully infringed two IBM
patents. The Lufkin Division patents cover methods for storing data, presenting
applications and presenting advertising on a computer network. The Tyler
Division patents cover an electronic catalog requisition system and related
information retrieval and ordering methods and a computer-implemented hypertext
system and method for operating a computer-implemented object-oriented
hypertext system. Each suit sought, among other things, compensatory damages
and injunctive relief. On December 14, 2006, Amazon answered, counterclaimed in
each suit and sought to transfer the Lufkin suit to consolidate it with Tyler
suit. IBM filed its opposition to the transfer motion on January 2, 2007 and
answered the counterclaims in both suits on January 8. On January 16, 2007, the
Lufkin court denied Amazons transfer motion. 
In May 2007, the parties to the Lufkin suit and the Tyler suit settled
these matters and both actions were dismissed.
On November 29,
2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc. (PSI) in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. IBM
asserted claims for patent infringement and breach of contract in connection
with PSIs development and marketing of a computer system that PSI says is
compatible with IBMs S/390 and System z architectures. IBM also sought a
declaratory judgment that its refusal to license its patents to PSI and certain
of its software for use on PSI systems does not violate the antitrust laws. IBM
seeks damages and injunctive relief. On January 19, 2007, PSI answered the
complaint and asserted counterclaims against IBM for alleged monopolization and
attempted monopolization, tying, violations of New York and California statutes
proscribing unfair competition, tortious interference with the acquisition of
PSI by a third party and promissory estoppel. PSI also sought declaratory
judgments of noninfringement of IBMs patents and patent invalidity. Discovery
is proceeding and the court has ordered that the case be ready for trial in the
Fall of 2008.
18 


In October 2003, a
purported collective action lawsuit was filed against IBM in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California by ten former IBM
employees alleging, on behalf of themselves and allegedly similarly situated
former employees, that the company engaged in a pattern and practice of
discriminating against employees on the basis of age when it terminated
employees in connection with reductions in force. Initially, the District Court
dismissed the lawsuit on the basis of release agreements signed by all the
plaintiffs. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial courts finding
that the release barred these claims, and in January 2007 after denial of IBMs
petition for rehearing, the matter was returned to the trial court for further
proceedings. IBM has moved to dismiss portions of the complaint; a decision is
pending on that motion.
The company is a defendant in a civil
lawsuit brought in Tokyo District Court by Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks
to recover losses that it allegedly suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated
civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy) proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to
pay Tokyo Leasing amounts for which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and
others liable.  The claims in this suit
include tort and breach of contract.
The company is
party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or
state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws similar
to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate
in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The
company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or
remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites
globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country,
state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims
concerning certain current or former operating sites.
The company is also subject to ongoing tax
examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Similar to
many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in
various challenges with Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax
assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. These matters principally
relate to claims for taxes on the importation of computer software. The total
amounts related to these matters are approximately $1.9 billion, including
amounts currently in litigation and other amounts. The company believes it will
prevail on these matters and that these amounts are not meaningful indicators
of liability.
In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5), the company records a provision with respect to a
claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims
and proceedings are reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or
adjusted to reflect the impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of
counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded
liabilities for the above items, including any changes to such liabilities for
the quarter ended June 30, 2007, were not material to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Based on its experience, the company believes that the
damage amounts claimed in the matters referred to above are not a meaningful
indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the
ultimate outcome of the matters previously discussed. While the company will
continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters, it is possible that
the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or
more of these matters.
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally
determined in any such claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could
reasonably have a material effect on the companys business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables,
including the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and
type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses,
damages or remedies may have on the companys Consolidated Financial
Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter
which may give rise to additional factors.
19 


14.   The companys
extended lines of credit include unused amounts of $3,762 million and
$2,895 million at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.  A portion of these amounts was available to
the companys business partners to support their working capital needs. In
addition, the company committed to provide future financing to its customers in
connection with customer purchase agreements for approximately $2,859 million
and $2,496 million at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
The company has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee or
indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5 by requiring a guarantor to
disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the
guarantors performance is remote. The following is a description of
arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
The company is a party to a variety of agreements
pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect
to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of
contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily
agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of
representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets
sold, certain IP rights, specified environmental matters, third-party
performance of non-financial contractual obligations and certain income taxes.
In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the
other party making an adverse claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the
particular contract, which procedures typically allow the company to challenge
the other partys claims. Further, the companys obligations under these
agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some
instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain
payments made by the company.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential
amount of future payments under these or similar agreements, due to the
conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the companys business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and
financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these
financial guarantees was $31 million and $32 million at June 30, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, respectively.

The decrease in the warranty liability balance was primarily
driven by a reduction in estimated future costs as a result of the divestiture

in April 2005.
15.   Subsequent
Events: On July 16, 2007, the company announced an agreement to acquire
DataMirror Corporation, a publicly held company, for approximately $160
million. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2007.
On July 31, 2007, the company announced that the Board
of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share.  The dividend is payable September 10, 2007 to
shareholders of record on August 10, 2007.

The following Results of Continuing Operations discussion does not
  include the hard disk drive (HDD) business that the company sold to Hitachi,
  Ltd. on December 31, 2002. The HDD business was accounted for as a
  discontinued operation under generally accepted accounting principles. There
  was a $1 million loss from Discontinued Operations in the second quarter of
  2007 and no loss for the first six months of 2007, versus no loss in the
  second quarter and first six months of 2006.

5.9 percent adjusted for currency



 
Within the Management Discussion, selected references
to adjusted  for currency or at
constant currency are made so that the financial results can be viewed without
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby
facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the companys business
performance.
In the second quarter, total revenue increased 8.6
percent as reported, 5.9 percent adjusted for currency, versus the second
quarter of 2006. Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $3,142 million,
up 8.8 percent compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations was $1.55 in the quarter and included a $0.05 gain from
the divestiture of the companys printing business in June; excluding the
printer gain, diluted earnings per share increased 15.4 percent year- to-year.
In the second quarter, the company executed a $12.5 billion accelerated share
repurchase, and, in total, repurchased approximately nine percent of the common
shares outstanding at March 31, 2007.
The companys second quarter financial results
demonstrated improving revenue growth, gross margin expansion and strong cash
flow performance.
The revenue growth rate, adjusted for currency, at 5.9
percent, was the strongest quarterly growth rate in six years. Geographic
results were strong; business performance was led by Asia Pacific which grew
9.8 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency). Europe continued to improve, up
13.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency). Americas had the best
improvement versus the first quarter, led by the U.S. which grew 6 percent
after a weak first-quarter 2007 performance. Improved sales execution and
improving economic trends contributed to revenue results in the quarter. In
addition, the company continued to benefit from its investments and strong
growth in its emerging country markets where revenue grew 32.5 percent (25 percent
adjusted for currency).
Segment revenue performance was driven by strong
Software growth (12.7 percent), particularly in the key branded middleware
offerings (22.8 percent), where over half of the growth was organic. In
addition, both Global Services businesses had revenue growth of 10.1 percent in
the second quarter. Systems and Technology revenue increased (1.8 percent)
primarily driven by System x, System p and System z server revenue, and Systems
Storage revenue, partially offset by a decline in Microelectronics and impacts
from the divestiture of the printing business. Global Financing revenue
increased (3.6 percent) reflecting an improvement in financing revenue due to
an increase in financing assets and increased used equipment sales.
21 


The gross profit margin was 41.8 percent in the second
quarter versus 41.2 percent in the second quarter of 2006.  The increase in the gross profit margin was
primarily driven by operational efficiencies and a mix shift to higher margin
businesses. Global Financings margin declined due to narrowing financing
spreads and increased interest costs.
Total expense and other income increased over the
year-earlier period by 11.0 percent.  The
increase was primarily due to the companys continuing investments in higher
value capabilities, including middleware software, services, emerging countries
and acquisitions. In addition, workforce rebalancing expenses increased, as
well as interest expense driven by new debt related to the accelerated share
repurchase, offset partially by the gain related to the sale of the printing
business. The ratio of Total expense to revenue increased 0.6 points to 28.6
percent for the second quarter versus the comparable period of 2006.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2007
was 28.0 percent versus 30.0 percent in the second quarter of 2006.
Cash flow from operating activities was $3,444
million, an increase of $877 million versus the second quarter of 2006 and an
improvement of $428 million compared to the first quarter of 2007.
Total Global Services signings were $11.7 billion in
the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $9.6 billion for the three months
ended June 30, 2006.  The estimated total
Global Services backlog was $116 billion at June 30, 2007, an increase of $1
billion versus March 31, 2007 and $7 billion versus June 30, 2006.

**          4.8 percent
adjusted for currency
 
For the first six
months of 2007, total revenue increased 7.6 percent as reported, 4.8 percent
adjusted for currency, versus the prior year. Pre-tax income from continuing
operations was $5,721 million, a 7.4 percent increase compared to the first
half of 2006. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.75,
reflecting a 16 percent improvement year-to-year.
Revenue performance in
the first half was led by Software and both Global Services businesses.
Geographically, Asia Pacific demonstrated the strongest business performance,
with good improvement in Europe as well. Performance in the companys emerging
country markets remains very strong, with revenue growth of 28.4 percent (23
percent adjusted for currency) in the first half versus the first half of 2006.
22




The gross profit margin
for the first six months of 2007 was 41.1 percent, an improvement of 0.9 points
versus the prior year. The company has improved its gross profit margin
year-to-year for 12 consecutive quarters. The focus on productivity initiatives,
combined with an improved business mix, has led to the overall margin
improvement.
Total expense and other
income increased 11.1 percent in the first half of 2007. This increase was
primarily driven by the continuing investments to drive future business growth
and develop higher value capabilities.
The effective tax rate
for the first six months of 2007 was 28.2 percent versus 30.0 percent for the
comparable period in 2006.
For the first six months
of 2007, cash flow from operating activities was $6,459 million, an increase of
$783 million versus the first half of 2006.
Assets declined
approximately $686 million from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2007 primarily
due to lower Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities of $467
million. In addition, short-term financing receivables declined by $1,706
million during the first six months of 2007. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in pension assets of $750 million, an increase in prepaid
expenses of $635 million and an increase in long-term marketable securities of
$151 million.
Liabilities increased
approximately $11,064 million from December 31, 2006 primarily driven by the
$11.5 billion short-term debt issuance in June related to the accelerated share
repurchase.
Stockholders equity declined
approximately $11,750 million primarily due to the companys common stock
repurchases, including the accelerated share repurchase transaction, which
resulted in the companys repurchasing 118.8 million shares which are held as
Treasury stock at June 30, 2007.

The companys two
services segments, Global Technology Services and Global Business Services,
together had revenue of $13.1 billion, an increase of 10.1 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and $25.5 billion, an increase of
8.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2007,
respectively, when compared to same periods of 2006.  The second-quarter revenue growth, adjusted
for currency, was the strongest performance in over three years.
Global Technology
Services (GTS) revenue increased 10.1 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency)
and 8.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and
first six months of 2007, respectively, versus the second quarter and first
half of 2006. Revenue growth was balanced across the business lines and was
strong across all geographies. Total signings in GTS increased 20 percent in
the second quarter of 2007, with longer term signings increasing 27 percent and
shorter term signings increasing 8 percent.
Strategic
Outsourcing (SO) revenue was up 7.8 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in
the second quarter and 6.8 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first six months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006.  Revenue increased in all geographies and was
driven by a combination of good signings performance over the past twelve
months, continued lower base contract erosion and good execution in selling new
business into existing accounts. The focus on existing customers and service
delivery was key to the growth in the base accounts during the second quarter.
Client demand for additional contract scope and short term projects was
positive, which translate quickly into revenue. This revenue growth helped
mitigate some of the dependency on new customer signings. SO signings in the
second quarter of 2007 increased 22 percent when compared to the second quarter
of 2006.
Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue returned to growth in the second
quarter and was up 15.2 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency) year to
year.  For the first six months of 2007,
BTO revenue increased 7.2 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) versus the
first six months of 2006.  Second quarter
BTO signings increased 69 percent year to year.
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 14.6 percent (12 percent adjusted
for currency) in the second quarter and 13.6 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first six months of 2007 when compared to the same periods in
2006.  ITS signings in the quarter
increased 8 percent year to year. 
Sustained signings growth is driving continued improvement in revenue
and reflects progress from the changes the company implemented to improve the
ITS business.  A component of growth
within ITS is IT Security Solutions, where Internet Security Systems (ISS)
contributes to the companys capabilities.
25 


Maintenance
revenue increased 9.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) and 8.0 percent
(5 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2007, respectively versus the same periods in the prior year. The companys
maintenance business continues to benefit from providing availability services
on non-IBM IT equipment.  The rate of
growth improved 3 points sequentially from the first quarter of 2007 driven
primarily (2 points) by the inclusion of the recently commenced services
agreement with InfoPrint Solutions, Inc. The impact of this agreement will
increase in the third quarter of 2007, when a full quarter of maintenance
services are provided.  See Note 9 on
pages 14 and 15 for additional information.
Global Business
Services (GBS) revenue increased 10.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency)
and 9.4 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and
first half of 2007 versus the prior year periods, respectively.  Revenue growth was balanced across all three
geographies, with the strongest growth coming from Asia Pacific, and was also
balanced across the two major business lines: Application Management Services
and Core Consulting.  Total signings in GBS
increased 23 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Longer term signings
increased 70 percent and shorter term signings were up 6 percent.
The company is
benefiting from the transformational actions taken to improve the GBS
business.  The company has increased the
competitiveness of its offerings and expanded its capabilities in areas of
strong customer demand, such as Services Oriented Architecture (SOA).  The company has also leveraged its global
delivery capabilities across the portfolio. 
These actions collectively have contributed to continued signings
growth, increased revenue growth and margin expansion.

Global Technology
Services gross profit increased 10.1 percent in the quarter and 8.5 percent in
the first half of 2007 compared to the same periods of 2006, with flat gross
profit margins year to year. The second quarter gross profit margin improved
0.6 points from the first quarter. The GTS segment pre-tax margin was 8.6
percent in the second quarter of 2007, a decline of 0.8 points versus
second-quarter 2006, driven by restructuring charges incurred to address cost
issues, primarily in the U.S. The first half segment pre-tax margin was 8.2
percent, a decrease of 1.6 points year to year. 
The pre-tax margin decline was driven by increased investments in sales
and delivery, the impact of recently completed acquisitions and the restructuring
charges.
Global Business
Services gross profit increased to $1.1 billion for the second quarter and $2.1
billion for the first six months of 2007 versus the same periods of 2006. Gross
profit margins improved 0.9 points and 1.7 points year to year in the second
quarter and first six months, respectively. 
Segment pre-tax margin was 10.4 percent in the second quarter and the
first six months of 2007, an improvement of 0.9 points and 1.4 points, respectively,
versus the prior year periods.  Both the
gross margin and pre-tax margin improvements were driven by revenue growth,
improved resource utilization, stable-to-improving pricing trends and strong
contract management.

Global Services Signings
In the second quarter of 2007, total Global Services signings increased 22
percent year to year to $11,658 million. Shorter term signings increased for
the fourth consecutive quarter to $5,296 million.  Longer term signings were $6,362 million, an
increase of 38 percent year to year. GTS signings were $6,534 million and GBS
signings were $5,124 million in the second quarter of 2007.  The company signed 11 deals greater than $100
million in the quarter and the total Global Services backlog was estimated at
$116 billion, an increase of $1 billion versus March 31, 2007 and an increase
of $7 billion when compared to June 30, 2006.

Global Services
signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients
commitment under a Global Services contract. Signings are used by management to
assess period performance of Global Services management. There are no
third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management is an approximation of constant currency,
and involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients
commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence
of termination charges or wind-down costs. For example, for longer term
contracts that require significant upfront investment by the company, the
portions of these contracts that are a signing are those periods in which there
is a significant economic impact on the client if the commitment is not
achieved, usually through a termination charge or the client incurring
significant wind-down costs as a result of the termination. For shorter term
contracts that do not require significant upfront investments, a signing is
usually equal to the full contract value. Longer term contracts represent SO and
BTO contracts as well as GBS contracts with the U.S. Federal government and its
agencies and Application Management Services (AMS) for custom and legacy
applications. Shorter term contracts represent the remaining GBS offerings of
Consulting and Systems Integration, AMS
for packaged applications and ITS contracts. These amounts have been
adjusted to exclude the impact of year to year currency changes.
Signings include
SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are
treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value.
Maintenance is not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be
more steady-state, where revenues equal renewals, and therefore, the company
does not think they are as useful a predictor of future performance.
Backlog includes
SO, BTO, ITS, GBS, and Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of
overall work under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations,
adjustments for revenue not materialized and currency assumptions used to
approximate constant currency.
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincident to an acquisition or divestiture.

Systems and Technology
revenue increased 1.8 percent (essentially flat adjusted for currency) and
2.0 percent (essentially flat adjusted for currency) in the second quarter
and first six months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006. On
June 1, 2007, the company completed the divestiture of its printing business.
This impacted Systems and Technologys revenue growth by two points in the
quarter and going forward will result in the loss of approximately $250 million
of revenue per quarter. See Note 9 on pages 14 and 15 for additional
information regarding this divestiture.
System z revenue increased
4.0 percent and 7.1 percent (1 percent and 4 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2007
versus the second quarter and first six months of 2006, respectively. System z
had double-digit revenue growth in Asia Pacific and good growth in Europe,
partially offset by lower revenue in the Americas. MIPS (millions of
instructions per second) shipments increased 45 percent in the second
quarter versus the second quarter of 2006 reflecting
strength in both traditional and specialty workloads. This is the eighth
consecutive quarter of MIPS growth, longer than any product cycle since the
mid-90s.
MIPS for traditional workloads grew over 20 percent as
customers leverage the platforms superior economics, including reduced power
and cooling requirements. MIPS on specialty engines grew over 130 percent,
reflecting the mainframes ability to virtualize and consolidate different
workloads. Linux MIPS grew over 80 percent while Java and Database MIPS each
grew over 100 percent.
System i revenue decreased 15.1 percent and
14.4 percent (17 percent and 17 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and first six months of 2007 versus the same periods in
2006, respectively, as sales of upgrades remained weak. The company will be
introducing POWER6 technology on this platform in the third quarter of 2007.
System p revenue
increased 6.6 percent and 9.8 percent (4 percent and
7 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2007 versus the second quarter and first six months of 2006,
respectively, primarily driven by both high-end and low-end servers. In the
second quarter, System p began the transition to the next generation of POWER
technology with the introduction of POWER6 to the midrange products. The POWER6
microprocessor more than doubles the clock speed versus the previous
generation.  It also provides leading
edge energy management and enhanced virtualization capabilities.
28 


System x revenue increased 14.4 percent and
10.1 percent (12 percent and 7 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter and first six months of 2007 versus the second quarter and first
six months of 2006. The revenue increases were driven by growth across the
portfolio, especially in four-way and eight-way servers. Workload
virtualization and consolidation is driving demand for high-end System x
products. In addition, System x Blades revenue grew 15 percent in the second
quarter and 8 percent for the first six months of 2007.
System Storage revenue increased 6.0 percent and
2.7 percent (4 percent and flat adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first six months of 2007 versus the comparable periods in 2006. The
increases were driven by strong growth in tape products (19 percent in second
quarter and 10 percent in the first six months of 2007), while external disk
products were  flat for the second
quarter of 2007 and down 1 percent for the first six months of 2007. Enterprise
and Midrange tape products had double-digit revenue growth in the second
quarter of 2007 versus the second quarter of 2006.
Microelectronics revenue decreased 8.6 percent and 8.0
percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2007
versus the comparable periods of 2006. Overall demand for game processors has
not been as strong as anticipated. The company is pursuing opportunities in
other high growth segments, including wired and wireless communications.
Retail Stores Solutions revenue increased 18.3 percent
and 13.1 percent (15 percent and 10 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter and first six months of 2007 versus the same periods in 2006
primarily due to the continued roll out of new programmable point-of-sale
solutions to large retail clients.
Printer Systems revenue decreased 40.6 percent and
26.0 percent (41 percent and 27 percent adjusted for currency) primarily due to
the divestiture of the business on June 1, 2007. See Note 9 on pages 14 and 15
for additional information regarding this divestiture.

The increases in gross profit for the second quarter
and first six months of 2007 versus the same periods of 2006 were primarily due
to the increase in revenue and higher gross profit margins in System z and
System p. Margin improvements in the server brands were driven by client demand
for high-end products to support workload consolidation and virtualization.
Overall, gross margin in the second quarter increased
0.8 points versus the prior year. System z performance contributed 1.8 points
to the overall margin improvement, offset by lower margins in Systems Storage,
Microelectronics and Engineering & Technology Services which impacted the
overall margin by 0.4 points, 0.2 points and 0.3 points, respectively. First
half  gross margin increased 1.7 points
compared to the first half of 2006. System z and System p contributed 1.9
points and 1.0 points, respectively, to this improvement, driven by both
revenue growth and margin improvements. This was offset by lower margins in
Systems Storage and Engineering & Technology Services which impacted the
overall margin by 0.5 points and 0.2 points, respectively.
Systems and Technologys pre-tax margin increased 2.6
points and 2.5 points in the second quarter and first six months, respectively,
versus the prior year periods.

Software segment revenue
increased 12.7 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) and 10.8 percent (7
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006.  Revenue growth was driven by strong
performance from key branded middleware products.
Key Branded Middleware
revenue grew 22.8 percent (19 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter of 2007 and 20.0 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first six months of 2007, when compared to the same periods in 2006.  Greater than half of the branded middleware
growth in the second quarter was organic and revenue from key branded
middleware has increased to 53 percent (52 percent for first six months) of
total software revenue. As this fast-growing branded middleware becomes a
larger portion of the portfolio, it is having a greater impact on the companys
total software revenue growth rate.
Revenue from the
WebSphere family of products increased 27.6 percent (24 percent adjusted for
currency) and 21.2 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter
and first six months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006.
The WebSphere family of products provides a secure foundation for the
implementation of Services Oriented Architecture (SOA).  SOA-related products are in strong demand as evidenced
by double-digit growth in WebSphere Business Integration, Application Servers
and Portals.
Information
Management revenue increased 20.6 percent and 20.3 percent (17 percent and 16
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2007, respectively, versus the second quarter and first six months of 2006.
Information Management software is increasingly important in todays digital
world. With the growth in web-based applications, the ability to collect,
analyze and act on data is critical to the success of the companys
clients.  The Information on Demand
portfolio grew 17 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Within Information
Management, the Filenet acquisition continues to perform well. The companys
Distributed Relational Database products delivered its fourth consecutive
quarter of double-digit revenue growth.
30 


Revenue from Lotus
software increased 12.3 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) and 9.7
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006.  This is the eleventh consecutive quarter of
revenue growth from Lotus software, which is well established as a tool for
providing improved workplace collaboration and productivity.  In June 2007, the company delivered Lotus
Connections, a suite of social software for business.
Tivoli software
revenue increased 32.6 percent and 25.4 percent (28 percent and 21 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2007
versus the second quarter and first six months of 2006.  The Tivoli software portfolio includes
products which help customers manage complex networks and data centers.  The strong revenue performance was fueled
primarily by organic growth in Security, Storage and Systems Management
products. The MRO, Vallent and Consul acquisitions bolstered the brands strong
performance.
Rational revenue
increased 11.2 percent and 13.0 percent (8 percent and 9 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2007 versus the
comparable prior year periods.  Rational
software provides the tools necessary  to
build advanced applications and systems software. The company is investing
heavily in Rational with recently refreshed product lines and strategic
acquisitions. In the second quarter of 2007, the company announced the intent
to acquire Watchfire Corporation and Telelogic AB. This will further expand the
brands portfolio and reach into new markets and new customers.
Product Life Cycle
Management (PLM) software revenue decreased 19.2 percent and 9.1 percent  (22 percent and 12 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2007, respectively,
versus the same periods in 2006. PLM software helps companies improve their
product development processes and their ability to use product-related
information across their businesses.  The
revenue decline is against a particularly strong second quarter of 2006, where
the company closed a number of large deals.

Software segment gross
profit increased to $4.1 billion for the second quarter and to $7.6 billion for
the first six months of 2007, driven primarily by strong revenue growth.  Gross profit margin was 84.9 percent in the
second quarter, up 0.7 points year to year while gross profit margin was
relatively flat year to year in the first six months.
Segment pre-tax profit
increased 8.2 percent to $1.2 billion and 5.0 percent to $2.3 billion for the
second quarter and first six months of 2007 when compared to the same periods
of 2006.   The segment pre-tax profit
margin was 23.5 percent and 22.5 percent in the second quarter and first six
months of 2007, respectively, versus 24.2 percent and 23.6 percent in the
second quarter and first six months of 2006. Software pre-tax profit increased
year to year despite the decline in margins, which were driven by investments
in acquisitions, internal development and sales.  In recent years the company has increased its
investment in the software portfolio and operational execution has improved to
the point that the Software segment is now the largest provider of the companys
profit and its most stable source of growth.

Revenue increased in all
geographies in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2007 when
compared to the same periods in 2006. Adjusted for currency, performance was
led by Asia Pacific in both periods and all three geographies improved their
growth rate in the second quarter from the first quarter of 2007.
Americas revenue
increased 6.1 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the quarter and
improved 5 points sequentially, on an as-reported basis. Revenue growth in the
U.S. improved in the second quarter to 5.9 percent, reflecting improved
execution and an improving economy. Latin America increased 12.2 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency) and Canada increased 1.0 percent (decreased 2 percent
adjusted for currency).
Europe/Middle East/Africa
(EMEA) revenue increased 13.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter of 2007 when compared to the second quarter of 2006. In the
major countries, Spain increased 22.2 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency), Germany increased 14.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency),
the U.K. increased 14.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and Italy increased
10.9 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency). This was the second consecutive
quarter of solid revenue performance in Germany, benefiting from an improving
economy and better sales execution.
Asia Pacific revenue
increased 9.8 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter
of 2007 versus the second quarter of 2006. With solid execution, the company is
capitalizing on a strong economy and leveraging the investments made in
emerging markets. All geographic regions contributed to the increased revenue.
Although Japan decreased 3.0 percent as-reported, it increased (3 percent)
adjusted for currency for the third consecutive quarter.
Across the geographies,
the emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 32.5 percent
(25 percent adjusted for currency). These are among the fastest growing IT
markets in the world, and the company is investing to capture the growth.  Brazil grew 21.2 percent (9 percent adjusted
for currency), Russia increased 51.8 percent (52 percent adjusted for
currency), India increased 44.9 percent (32 percent adjusted for currency) and
China increased 34.1 percent (31 percent adjusted for currency).
32




OEM revenue decreased 9.2
percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2007 when
compared to the second quarter of 2006, driven by reduced demand for game
processors in the Microelectronics business.
Americas first half 2007
revenue was $19.2 billion, an increase of 3.8 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) from the 2006 period. The U.S. increased 3.2 percent, Canada
increased 1.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) and Latin America
increased 12.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency).
EMEA revenue was $15.8
billion, up 13.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six
months of 2007 versus the same period in 2006. Revenue increased in all major
countries with Spain up 21.2 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency),
Germany 17.1 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency), the UK 13.6 percent (3
percent adjusted for currency) and Italy 8.9 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency).
Asia Pacific revenue
increased 9.8 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) to $9.1 billion in the
first six months of 2007 when compared to the first six months of 2006.  Revenue, adjusted for currency, increased in
all geographic regions and was led by performance in the emerging markets of China
(increased 34.2 percent as reported, 31 percent adjusted for currency) and
India (increased 34.7 percent as reported, 28 percent adjusted for
currency).  Japan revenue decreased 0.9
percent as reported, but increased 3 percent when adjusted for currency.
Revenue in the key
emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 28.4
percent (23 percent adjusted for currency) in the first half of 2007 versus the
first half of 2006.  Together these
countries now represent 5 percent of the companys total revenue.  Brazil increased 19.4 percent (11 percent
adjusted for currency), Russia 27.3 percent (27 percent adjusted for currency),
India 34.7 percent (28 percent adjusted for currency) and China 34.2 percent
(31 percent adjusted for currency).
OEM revenue decreased 7.3
percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2007 on a
year to year basis as demand for the companys game processors has moderated
versus prior year levels.
Expense
The Total expense and
other income to revenue ratio was 28.6 percent for both the second quarter and
first six months of 2007 versus 28.0 percent and 27.7 percent for the second
quarter and first six months of 2006, respectively. The company is continuing
to make changes to the mix of its business, investing in higher value capabilities,
including strategic acquisitions, while divesting of commoditizing
businesses.  This has contributed to
higher gross margins, which have increased over five points from 2002 to 2006.  These higher value businesses also require
higher operating expenses reflecting the ongoing investment required to develop
and sell higher value capabilities. Total expense and other income increased
11.0 percent and 11.1 percent in the second quarter and first half of 2007,
respectively. The company expects some moderation of the expense growth rate in
the second half of the year. Total expense and other income growth rate in the
second half is expected to be in the range of seven to nine percent, with the
improvement skewed to the fourth quarter.

Total Selling, general
and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 14.5 percent
(12 percent adjusted for currency) and 12.6 percent (10 percent
adjusted for currency), respectively, in the second quarter and first six
months of 2007 versus the same periods in 2006. 
The increase in SG&Abase is primarily due to the investments the
company has been making in its software and services businesses, including
acquisitions, as well as emerging markets. This reflects the companys business
mix shift to higher value businesses which require higher operating expenses.
The returns on these investments are reflected in the momentum in key branded
middleware offerings, growth in emerging markets and improved Global Services
signings. In the second quarter, acquisitions drove approximately 4 points of
the growth and about 8 points of growth was largely driven by investments in
software and services businesses as well as emerging markets. In addition,
Workforce reductionsongoing increased as the company addressed cost issues in
the Global Technology Services business, primarily in Strategic Outsourcing,
during the second quarter.
For the first six months
of 2007 versus the first six months of 2006, currency was approximately 2
points of the increase in SG&A base expense, acquisitions related spending
drove approximately 5 points and 5 points of growth was largely driven by
investments in software and services businesses as well as emerging markets.

Other (income) and
expense was income of $253 million in the second quarter 2007 versus
income of $196 million in the second quarter of 2006. The increase
year-to-year was primarily driven by the gain associated with the divestiture
of the companys printing business to Ricoh. The second-quarter 2007 gain
associated with this transaction was $81 million. (See Note 9 on pages 14
and 15 for additional information). In addition, the increase in net gains from
securities and investment assets was primarily due to the sale of Lenovo stock
in the second quarter. As a result of the sale of Lenovo stock, the companys
ownership in Lenovo declined from 11.3 percent to 8.8 percent, with voting
ownership at 4.8 percent. The company hedges its major cross-border cash flows
to mitigate the effect of currency volatility in the year-over-year results.
The impact of these hedging programs is primarily reflected in Other (income)
and expense, as well as cost of goods sold. This quarter, losses from
derivatives resulted in $44 million of year-to-year impact to Other (income)
and expense.
The decline in Other (income) and expense for the
first six months of 2007 versus the first six months of 2006 was primarily
driven by the increase in expense associated with hedging programs, partially
offset by the gain from the divestiture of the printing business and sales of
Lenovo stock in the first and second quarter of 2007.

The timing and amount of
Sales and other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period
depending upon the timing of divestitures, economic conditions, industry
consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development. There
were no significant IP transactions in the second quarter or first six months
of 2007 and 2006. The increase in the second quarter of 2007 versus 2006 was
primarily due to a low base comparison from the second quarter of 2006.

The
increase in Interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of
2007 versus the same periods of 2006 was primarily due to the increase in
short-term debt to finance the companys accelerated share repurchase
agreements. See Note 7 on pages 12 and 13 for additional information regarding
this transaction. The term loan carries an interest rate of the London
Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 10 basis points. As a result, the company
expects to incur additional interest expense of approximately $270 million in
the second half of 2007, based on the current interest rate environment.

Interest expense is also
presented as part of Cost of Financing in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global
Financing external business. See page 50 for additional information regarding
Global Financing debt and interest expense.

Included in the amounts
above, the company incurred costs of approximately $322 million and
$337 million associated with its defined benefit pension plans for the
second quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The comparable amount for the
first six months of 2007 and 2006 was costs of approximately $635 million
and $674 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by
an increase in the cost of defined contribution plans of approximately $28
million and $69 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2007
versus the same periods of 2006. The second quarter 2007 year-to-year increase
impacted gross profit by approximately $18 million, while SG&A expense
decreased by approximately $3 million. The six months of 2007 year-to-year
increase impacted gross profit by approximately $35 million and RD&E
expense by approximately $2 million, while SG&A expense decreased by
approximately $2 million.

Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rates for the second quarter of 2007
and 2006 were 28.0 percent and 30.0 percent, respectively.  The corresponding effective tax rates for the
first six months of 2007 and 2006 were 28.2 percent and 30.0 percent,
respectively. The decline in the rate was due to a more favorable mix of income
in lower tax jurisdictions, reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit
passed by Congress in December 2006 and the gain associated with sale of the
printing business. The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six
months of 2007 would have been 28.5 percent excluding the impact of the
divestiture of the printing business.
With limited
exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or
non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2000. The
years subsequent to 2000 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations
of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or
timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax
audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax
and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result
for these years.
The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for
2004 and 2005 in the first quarter of 2007. 
The company anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end of
2008.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period.  Diluted earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the
period using the treasury stock method. 
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options,
stock awards and convertible notes.

The weighted average
number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the second quarter
and first six months of 2007 was 99.2 million and 81.8 million lower
than the same periods in 2006 primarily as a result of the companys common

Results of Discontinued Operations
There was a $1 million loss from Discontinued
Operations in the second quarter of 2007 and no loss for the first six months
of 2007 versus no loss in the second quarter and first six months of 2006.
Financial Position
Dynamics
The assets and debt
associated with the companys Global Financing business are a significant
part of IBMs financial position. Accordingly, although the financial position
amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the companys consolidated amounts
including Global Financing, to the extent the Global Financing business is a
major driver of the Consolidated Financial Position, reference in the narrative
section will be made to a separate Global Financing section in this
Management Discussion on pages 46 through 51. The amounts appearing in the
separate Global Financing section are supplementary data presented to
facilitate an understanding of the companys Global Financing business.
In second-quarter, the company repurchased
$14.6 billion of its outstanding common stock, of which $2.1 billion was
executed in open market transactions and the remainder of $12.5 billion was
repurchased through accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. Under the
agreements, which were executed on May 25, 2007, the company repurchased 118.8
million shares from three banks for an initial price of $105.18 per share.  The banks are expected to purchase an
equivalent number of shares in the open market during the next nine
months.  As discussed in Note 7 on pages
12 and 13, the initial price of the ASR is subject to an adjustment based on
the volume weighted average price of the shares during this
39 


period and this adjustment will be recorded in Stockholders equity in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on each of the settlement dates.
The ASR transaction was guaranteed by the company and was executed through
IBM International Group (IIG), a wholly-owned, foreign subsidiary of IBM. The
formation of IIG enabled the company to create a centralized foreign holding
subsidiary to own most of its non-U.S. operations. IIG funded the repurchases
with $1 billion in cash and an $11.5 billion, 364-day term loan with a number
of financial institutions. The term loan was guaranteed by the company and
carries an interest rate of the LIBOR plus 10 basis points. Principal and
interest on the loan will be paid by IIG with cash generated by its non-U.S.
operating subsidiaries. The execution of the ASR enabled the company to achieve
a substantial share reduction, a lower cost of capital and an effective use of
non-U.S. cash.

Current assets decreased
$2,367 million due to:
·                  Decline of
$2,562 million in short-term receivables driven by decreases of $1,706 million
in financing receivables and $833 million in trade receivables due to
collections of seasonally higher year-end balances;
·                  Decline of $467
million in Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities (see cash flow
analysis on page 41); partially offset by
·                  An increase of
$635 million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, primarily driven by
Taxes ($200 million).
Current liabilities
increased $7,993 million as a result of:
·                  Increase of
$11,641 million in Short-term debt driven by the 364-day Term Loan Agreement
the company entered into to finance the accelerated share repurchase agreements
in the second quarter of 2007 (see Note 7 on pages 12 and 13 for additional
information);
·                  Growth of $772
million in Deferred income, resulting from increases of $684 million primarily
in Global Technology Services, primarily resulting from the prepayment of
future services related to the divestiture of the printing business; partially
offset by
·                  Decrease of
$2,356 million in Taxes payable primarily due to the adoption of FIN 48;
consistent with the provisions of FIN 48, $2,066 million of income tax
liabilities was reclassified from current to non-current liabilities because
payment is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date; the
balance of the reduction was related to payments in the first half of 2007; and
·                  Decrease of
$1,311 million in Accounts payable and a decrease of $773 million in
Compensation and benefits, primarily resulting from declines in balances from
typically higher year-end levels.
The debt utilized in the
accelerated share repurchase agreements is classified as Short-term debt in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. As a result of this transaction,
the companys working capital is negative and its current ratio is 0.88 as of
June 30, 2007. The company expects to report positive working capital and an
improved current ratio as this short-term debt is refinanced with long-term
debt over the next 12 months.

Net cash from operating
activities increased $783 million compared to the first half of 2006 driven by
the following key factors:
·                  Increase in
cash from deferred income ($967 million) primarily driven by Global Technology
Services, which includes approximately $300 million prepayment of future
services related to the divesiture of the companys printing business;
·                  Lower
retirement-related plan funding of $769 million ($1,550 million funding of
non-U.S. plans in 2006 versus $781 million in 2007: $500 million in the U.S.
for retiree medical and $281 million funding for non-U.S. plans);
·                  Increase in net
income of $375 million; and
·                  Lower
restructuring payments of $221 million; partially offset by
·                  Lower cash
provided by accounts receivable of $966 million primarily driven by Global
Financing due to lower capital lease portfolio run-outs and improved volumes in
customer loans;
·                  Decrease in cash
driven by accounts payable of $407 million mainly resulting from higher
payments in the U.S. in the first half of 2007.
Net cash used in
investing activities declined $2,402 million driven by:
·                  Decrease of $1,664
million in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments mainly
due to increased net proceeds from short-term marketable securities; and
·                  Decrease of $568
million in acquisitions; and an
·                  Increase of $310
million in divestitures driven by the divestiture of the companys printing
business (see Note 9 on pages 14 and 15 for additional information).
Net cash used in
financing activities decreased $1,237 million as a result of:
·                  Increase of
$13,244 million in net cash proceeds from debt; and
·                  Higher common
stock transactions  other ($1,408 million), partially offset by
·                  Higher common
stock repurchases ($13,145 million); and
·                  Higher dividend
payments ($268 million).
41 


Both the increase in net
cash proceeds from debt and the higher common stock repurchases were driven by
the companys accelerated share repurchase in the second quarter of 2007 (see
Note 7 on pages 12 and 13).

The increase in
Non-current assets of $1,682 million was driven by:
·                  Increase of $750
million in prepaid pension assets partially due to contributions made to
certain non-US plans;
·                  Increase of $347
million in goodwill driven by the companys acquisitions in the first half of
2007; and
·                  Increase of $484
million in Investments and sundry assets which was primarily attributable to an
increase of;
- $191 million in
deferred transition costs driven by an increase in long-term services
arrangements with clients; and
- $151 million due to
increased investments in long-term marketable securities.
Long-term debt increased
$398 million primarily due to new borrowings in the first half of 2007.
Other Non-current
liabilities, excluding debt, increased $2,673 million primarily driven by;
·                  A reclass from
current to non-current taxes payable of $2,066 million resulting from the
implementation of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. 
At this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable
estimate of the timing of payments in individual fiscal years beyond 12 months
due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
·                  Growth of $404
million in non-current deferred income primarily driven by Global Technology
Services; partially offset by
·                  Decrease of $337
million in Retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations
primarily driven by the $500 million funding of the U.S. nonpension
postretirement plan.
Debt
The companys
funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to
manage the companys overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the
company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as
needed.

Financing balance sheet on page 47.
Non-Global
Financing debt increased $11,382 million and the debt-to-capitalization
ratio increased to 46.7 percent, primarily due to the financing of the companys
accelerated share repurchase agreements in the second quarter of 2007 (see Note
7 on pages 12 and 13 for additional information).

Equity
Stockholders
equity decreased $11,750 million primarily as a result of a decrease related to
net stock transactions of $15,726 million, driven by the companys common stock
repurchases which resulted in an increase in Treasury stock at June 30, 2007.
This reduction was
offset by:
·      An increase of $3,071
million in retained earnings primarily driven by net income of $4,105 million
and the $117 million cumulative catch adjustment to the retained earnings
opening balance related to the implementation of FIN 48, partially offset by
dividends ($1,044 million); and
·      An increase of $904 million
in Accumulated gains and (losses) not affecting retained earnings primarily
resulting from the amortization in the first half of 2007 of unrecognized
pension costs ($470 million).
Looking Forward
The following key
drivers impacting IBMs business are described in more detail in the 2006 IBM
Annual Report on page 21.
·   Economic environment and
corporate spending budgets
·   Internal business
transformation and global integration initiatives
·   Innovation initiatives
·   Open standards
·   Investing
in growth opportunities
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in 170 countries, with more than 60
percent of its revenue generated outside the U. S. In addition, approximately
65 percent of the companys employees are located outside the United States,
including about 30 percent in Asia Pacific. This global reach gives the company
access to markets, with local management teams who understand the clients and
their challenges and who can respond to these opportunities with value-add
solutions.
The companys long-term financial model
objective is to generate 10 to 12 percent earnings per share growth over the
long term through a combination of revenue growth, margin improvement and
effective capital deployment to fund growth and provide returns to shareholders
through dividends and common stock repurchases. 
In May, the company met with investors and analysts and discussed a roadmap
for earnings per share growth through 2010 in the range of $9  11 per share or
10 to 16 percent, which included additional earnings growth potential from a
number of sources including growth initiatives, acquisitions and the current
projected impact of retirement related expense over this period.
The companys performance in the second
quarter and first half of 2007 highlighted the benefits of its global reach and
the strength of its business model. The financial results reflected solid
progress on major elements of the long term goals, however, the company
measures the success of its business model over the long term, not any
individual quarter or year. The companys strategies, investments and actions
are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
The company will
continue to selectively pursue acquisitions to expand its capabilities. The
company has a targeted acquisition strategy and has developed the ability to
efficiently acquire, integrate and accelerate new product and service
offerings. In addition, the company will continue to evaluate underperforming
and less strategic areas of its portfolio.
Within Software,
the company expects its Key Branded Middleware products to benefit from
continued development and sales investments in key product technologies such as
SOA and Information on Demand. In addition, targeted acquisitions will continue
to broaden the companys software capabilities.
In its Global
Services business, the company has achieved improved revenue growth and profit
expansion in GBS as a result of targeted actions and the operational
transformation of the business that has been ongoing over the past two years.
This accelerated revenue growth, combined with margin expansion, generated
segment pre-tax profit growth of 19 percent in
43 


the second quarter and 25 percent in the first half.
Within GTS, the company has implemented a series of actions to address the U.S.
cost base, including a focus on resource and cost management disciplines and
rebalancing resources as the company executes its global resource strategy. GTS
had a solid second quarter with an improved revenue growth rate and better
execution. The company expects these actions to drive continued improvements in
GTS going-forward.
 
The Systems and Technology business remains the leader
in servers. Going forward, the company will focus its investments on
differentiating technologies with high-growth potential including POWER6,
blades, high-performance computing and energy efficiency. The transition to
POWER6 technology, which began with System p mid-range products in the second
quarter, will continue with implementation on the System i platform in the
third quarter. Clients are continuing to consolidate and virtualize their
workloads and this trend is positive for demand for the companys high-end
servers. As discussed in Note 9 on pages 14 
and 15, the company has divested its printing business in a transaction
with Ricoh. Going-forward, this divestiture results in the loss of
approximately $250 million of revenue per quarter in the System and Technology
business.
Total expense and other income increased 11 percent in the first half of
2007. Looking-forward, in the second half, the company expects total expense
growth, excluding any future acquisitions, to be down 2 - 4 points from the
first half levels, with more of this improvement expected in the fourth quarter
versus the third quarter.
Total retirement-related plan cost increased in the
first six months of 2007, as compared with the first six months of 2006, by $34
million as discussed on page 37. For the full year, the company estimates
pre-tax retirement-related plan expense to increase approximately $100 million
when compared to 2006. This expected year-to-year change is primarily driven by
an increase in the cost of defined contribution plans. The cost of defined
benefit plans is estimated to be essentially flat year to year as increases due
to changes in the actuarial assumptions (used to determine 2007 expense) will
be offset by expected savings due to better-than-expected 2006 return on asset
performance.
The company expects stock-based compensation expense
to decline in 2007 when compared with 2006. The anticipated decline is expected
to be less than $100 million on a pre-tax basis.
The company expects that its effective tax rate in
2007 will be approximately 28.5 percent. The rate will change year to year
based on non-recurring events, such as the settlements of income tax audits, as
well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes,
the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes
and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
In 2006 and 2005, the companys cash tax rate was
approximately 16 percent.
The companys cash tax rate represents the amount of
income taxes paid during the year over Income from continuing operations before
income taxes. The company anticipates that its cash tax rate will increase in
the near term as the company has now fully utilized its U.S. federal tax credit
carryforwards.
Currency Rate
Fluctuations
Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies
to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results. At June 30, 2007, currency
changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies
being translated into more dollars than at year-end 2006. The company uses a
variety of financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks
related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based
transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears in the 2006
IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on
pages 83 to 86.
The company earned approximately half of its pre-tax
income from continuing operations in countries other than the U.S. The company
also maintains hedging programs to limit the volatility of currency impacts on
the companys financial results. These hedging programs limit the impact of
currency changes on the companys financial results but do not eliminate them.
In addition to the translation of earnings and the companys hedging programs,
the impact of currency changes also may affect the companys pricing and
sourcing actions. For example, the company may procure components and supplies
in multiple functional currencies and sell products and services in other
currencies. Therefore, it is impractical to quantify the impact of currency on
these transactions and on consolidated net income. Generally, the company
believes that extended periods of dollar weakness are positive for net income
and extended periods of dollar strength are negative, although the precise
impact is difficult to assess.
44 


For non-U.S.
subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic
environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in
results of operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking
prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into foreign
currency hedge contracts.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
On pages 43
and 44 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. One table, on
page 43, includes each of the past five years of the companys Net cash
from operating activities, Cash and marketable securities and the size of the
companys global credit facilities. For the six months ended or as of, as
applicable, June 30, 2007, those amounts are $6.5 billion, $10.2 billion and
$10 billion, respectively.
The major rating agencies ratings on the
companys debt securities at June 30, 2007 appear in the table below. The
Standard and Poors and Moodys Investors Services ratings remain unchanged
from December 31, 2006. In May, Fitch Ratings lowered its ratings on senior
long-term debt from AA- to A+ and on commercial paper from F1+ to F1. Fitch
changed its ratings following the companys issuance of new debt utilized to
fund the accelerated share repurchase. The company has no contractual
arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a
material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. The company
believes its earnings and cash flow growth provide sufficient flexibility
within the existing credit ratings to continue to execute its current
investment, dividend and acquisition strategies.

The table
appearing on page 44 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report presents the way in
which management reviews its cash flows for each of the past five years and is
accompanied by a description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and
reviewed. While the company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, on page 7
of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events underlying sources and
uses of cash in that format on page 41 of this Form 10-Q, the
following is the management view of cash flows for the first six months of 2007
and 2006 prepared in a manner consistent with the table on page 44 of the
2006 IBM Annual Report:

From the perspective of how management views cash flows, in the first half
of 2007, net cash from operating activities, excluding Global Financing
receivables, was $4.8 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to the
first six months of
45 


2006. Cash performance in the first half was driven by the growth in net
income from continuing operations, continued focus on working capital and lower
pension funding year over year.
Events that could temporarily change the historical
cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating
results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse
impacts from litigation or future pension funding requirements during periods
of severe and prolonged downturns in the capital markets. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in Note 13 on pages 17 to 19 of this Form
10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company is not quantifying any
future impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets.
Global
Financing
Global Financing is a business segment within IBM that is measured as if it were a
standalone entity. Accordingly, the information presented in this section is
consistent with this separate company view.

Global Financing
revenue increased 2.6 percent in the second quarter of 2007 versus the same
period in 2006.  External revenue
increased 3.6 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) driven by financing
revenue of $448 million in 2007 versus $426 million in 2006 due primarily to an
increase in the average external asset balance. 
Internal revenue increased 0.9 percent primarily driven by internal
financing revenue of $157 million in 2007 versus $143 million in 2006 due
primarily to an increase in the average asset balance, partially offset by
internal used equipment sales of $184 million in 2007 versus $195 million in
2006, a decrease of 5.7 percent due primarily to lower sales to the System and
Technology segment.
Global Financing
revenue increased 2.2 percent in the first six months of 2007 versus the same
period in 2006.  External revenue
increased 4.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) driven by financing
revenue of $888 million in 2007 versus $855 million in 2006, an increase of 3.9
percent due to an increase in the average external asset balance and external
used equipment sales of $323 million in 2007 versus $303 million in 2006.  Internal revenue decreased 1.8 percent driven
by internal used equipment sales of $354 million in the first six months of
2007 versus $418 million in the same period in 2006, a decrease of 15.4 percent
due primarily to lower sales to the System and Technology segment, partially
offset by internal financing revenue of $335 million in 2007 versus $284
million in 2006 due primarily to an increase in the average asset balance.
Global Financing
gross profit increased $22 million or 4.5 percent for the second quarter and
decreased $7 million or 0.6 percent in the first six months of 2007 when
compared to the same periods last year. 
For the second quarter of 2007, the increase in gross profit was
primarily driven by used equipment sales gross profit of $143 million in the
second quarter of 2007 versus $118 million in 2006, an increase of 21.0 percent
due to an increase in internal used equipment sales gross profit.  Gross profit margin increased one percentage
point to 54.8 percent driven by an improvement in equipment sales margins,
partially offset by lower financing margins due to higher borrowing costs.  For the first six months of 2007, the decrease
in gross profit was driven primarily by higher borrowing costs, partially
offset by the increase in financing
46 


revenue discussed
above.  The decrease in gross profit
margin is driven by lower financing margins due to higher borrowing costs,
partially offset by an improvement in equipment sales margins.
Global Financing
pre-tax income increased 4.2 percent for the second quarter and decreased 3.7
percent in the first six months of 2007 when compared to the same periods last
year.  The increase in the second quarter
was driven by the increase in gross profit of $22 million discussed above,
partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expense
of $13 million.  The decrease in the
first six months of 2007 is primarily due to an increase in selling, general
and administrative expense of $24 million and the decrease in gross profit of
$7 million discussed above.
The decrease in
return-on-equity in the second quarter of 2007 versus the second quarter of
2006 and for the first six months of 2007 compared to the first six months of
2006 was primarily due to a higher average equity balance.

(a) Amounts eliminated for
purposes of IBMs consolidated results and therefore do not appear on pages 5
and 6.
(b) These assets, along with
all other financing assets in this table, are leveraged using Global Financing
debt.
(c) Global Financing debt
includes debt of the company and of the Global Financing units that support the
Global Financing business.
Sources and Uses of Funds
The primary use of
funds in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing
assets. Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware, software and services,
but also include non-IBM
equipment, software and services to meet IBM
clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for equipment as well as
loans for hardware, software and services with terms generally for two to seven
years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services
and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis in
order to mitigate the associated risk. Unsecured loan agreements include
protective language, security deposit advances and dollar limits on how much
can be financed in order to minimize credit risk. Client financing also
includes internal activity as described on page 49 of the 2006 IBM Annual
Report.
47 


Commercial
financing receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable
financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM
products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts receivable
financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term receivables are
primarily unsecured and are also subject to additional credit actions in order
to mitigate the associated risk.
Originations
The following are
total external and internal financing originations.

Total new
originations exceeded cash collections of client and commercial financing
assets in the second quarter of 2007, which resulted in a net increase in
financing assets in this period. Cash collections of both client and commercial
financing assets exceeded new financing originations in the first six months of
2007, which resulted in a net decline in financing assets from December 31,
2006. The increase in originations in both periods was due to improving volumes
in client and commercial financing in the first six months of 2007 versus 2006.
Cash generated by
Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and
dividends to IBM.

*
  Represents reserved receivables, net of recoveries, that were
disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents
translation adjustments.
The percentage of
financing receivables reserved decreased from 1.5 percent at December 31, 2006
to 1.3 percent at June 30, 2007 due to the disposition of previously reserved
receivables combined with lower requirements for additional reserves.
Unallocated reserves decreased 13.2 percent from $76 million at December
31, 2006 to $66 million at June 30, 2007. The decrease in unallocated
reserves is due to the improved credit quality of the portfolio, as well as the
decline in gross financing receivables. Specific reserves decreased 15.3
percent from $294 million at December 31, 2006 to $249 million at
June 30,
48 


2007. The decrease in
specific reserves was due to the disposition of reserved receivables during the
period combined with lower requirements for additional specific reserves.
Global Financings
bad debt expense was a decrease of $8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2007, compared with a decrease of $9 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2006. The continued reduction in bad debt expense was primarily
attributed to the improved credit quality of the portfolio.
Residual Value
Residual value is
a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at
lease inception.  Global Financing has
insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them to the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
Global Financing optimizes the recovery of residual
values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to
new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.  Sales of used equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at the end of lease, represented 35.6 percent
of Global Financings revenue in both the second quarter and first six months
of 2007 and 37.8 percent and 38.8 percent in the second quarter and first six
months, respectively, of 2006.  The
decrease in the second quarter of 2007 was driven primarily by lower internal
used equipment sales as well as a change in mix away from equipment sales
towards financing. The decrease for the first six months of 2007 was driven by
a decline in internal used equipment sales. 
The gross margins on these sales were 42.8 percent and 33.8 percent in
the second quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The increase is driven primarily by higher
margin internal used equipment sales. 
The gross margins were 43.3 percent and 40.5 percent for the first six
months of 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The increase is driven
by higher margin external used equipment sales.
The following
table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type and operating leases at December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007. In
addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the related
original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed residual value
assigned to equipment on leases at June 30, 2007 is expected to be returned to
the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value below, on a limited
basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the
equipment to be returned at end of lease. These third-party guarantees are
included in minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards in the
determination of lease classifications for the covered equipment and provide
protection against risk of loss arising from declines in equipment values for
these assets.  The residual value
guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining
the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease or operating lease. The
aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees were $190 million
and $148 million for the financing transactions originated during the
quarters ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively, and
$317 million and $243 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007
and June 30, 2006, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future
values at the scheduled end of lease were $7 million and $5 million for
the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2007
and June 30, 2006, respectively, and $14 million and $9 million for the
financing transactions originated during the six months ended June 30, 2007 and
June 30, 2006, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $1.1 million for
the quarter ended June 30, 2007 and $0.8 million for the quarter ended
June 30, 2006, and $2 million and $1.9 million for each of the six
months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively.

Global Financing
funds its operations primarily through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio
target of approximately 7 to 1. The debt is used to fund Global Financing
assets and is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of
the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term
and currency underlying the receivables. The intercompany loans are based on
arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are presented in the Global
Financing balance sheet on page 47.
The Global
Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys external
clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company (internal). As
previously stated, the
company manages and measures Global Financing as if it were a standalone
entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global
Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global
Financing Results of Operations on page 46 and in Segment Information on pages
61 and 62.
In the companys
Consolidated Statement of Earnings on pages 3 and 4, however, the interest
expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is
reclassified from Cost of Financing to Interest Expense.
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
Global Financing
is a segment of the company and as such is supported by the companys liquidity
position and access to capital markets. Cash generated from operations was
deployed to reduce debt and pay dividends to the company in order to maintain
an appropriate debt to equity ratio.

Looking Forward
Given Global
Financings mission of supporting IBMs hardware, software and services
businesses, originations for both client and commercial finance businesses will
be dependent upon the overall demand for IT hardware, software and services, as
well as client participation rates.
Interest rates and
the overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on
both revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management
policy, however, combined with the Global Financing funding strategy should
mitigate gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates. The companys
policy of matching asset and liability positions in foreign currencies will
limit the impacts of currency fluctuations.
The economy could
impact the credit quality of the Global Financing receivable portfolio and
therefore the level of provision for bad debt. Global Financing will continue
to apply rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and
the evaluation of the existing portfolio.
As discussed
above, Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value
risk through both insight into the product cycles as well as through its
remarketing business.
Global Financing
has policies in place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing.
These policies, combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for
the prudent management of the business going forward, even during periods of
economic uncertainty.

On October 31, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized $4.0 billion in
  funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase program, and the
  company stated that it would repurchase shares on the open market or in
  private transactions from time to time depending on market conditions. On
  April 24, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $15.0 billion
  in funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase program; the
  company stated that it may repurchase shares on the open market or in private
  transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions, depending on
  market conditions. See Note 7 on pages 12 and 13 for additional information
  regarding the accelerated share repurchase agreements executed in the second
