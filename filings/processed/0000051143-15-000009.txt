Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are
unaudited. In the opinion of the company's management, these statements include
all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to
present a fair statement of the company's results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.
 
      
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake
in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be
different from these estimates. Refer to the company's 2014 Annual Report on
pages 68 to 71 for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
     
 On October 20, 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business and manufacturing
operations to GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The assets and liabilities of the
Microelectronics business were reported as held for sale at December 31, 2014,
and the operating results of the Microelectronics business have been reported
as discontinued operations. The transaction closed on July 1, 2015. Refer to
Note 9, Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional information on the
transaction. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, the company renamed its
Systems & Technology segment to Systems Hardware and its System z brand to
z Systems.
 
      
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full
year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the company's 2014 Annual Report.
 
     
 Noncontrolling interest amounts of $2.4 million and $2.4 million, net of tax, for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $5.9 million and $4.2 million, net of tax, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are included
in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense
line item.
 
      
Within the financial statements and
tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of
rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated
where applicable.
  

 
2. Accounting
Changes:  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued guidance eliminating the requirement that an acquirer in a
business combination account for a measurement-period adjustment
retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period
adjustment during the period in which the amount of the adjustment is
determined. In addition, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period
earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting
periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of
the acquisition date should be presented separately on the face of the income
statement or disclosed in the notes. The guidance is effective January 1, 2016
with early adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material
impact in the consolidated financial results.   


       In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires all
inventories, except those using the last-in, first-out or retail methods, to be
measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonable
predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance is
effective January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is not
expected to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.
       In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance which removed the requirement to categorize
within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is
measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The
amendments also removed the requirement to make certain disclosures for all
investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset
value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to
investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using
that practical expedient. The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early
adoption permitted. The guidance is a change in disclosure only and will not
have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.  
       In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which
requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount
of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is
effective January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is a
change in financial

Statements – (continued)

statement presentation only and
will not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. At
September 30, 2015, the company had approximately $74 million in debt issuance
costs included in investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position.
       In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software
license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other
software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software
license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a services
contract. All software licenses recognized under this guidance will be
accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with early
adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material
impact in the consolidated financial results.    
       In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the
recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue recognition will
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures
regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of
adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance
recognized at the date of initial application. The guidance was initially
effective January 1, 2017 and early adoption was not permitted. In August 2015,
the FASB issued guidance which provides for a one-year deferral of the
effective date to January 1, 2018, with an option of applying the standard on
the original effective date. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
the new guidance, the effective date and the method of adoption.
        In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance that
changed the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Only disposals of
a component that represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major
effect on an entity's operations and financial results is a discontinued
operation. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures about discontinued
operations and disposals of a significant part of an entity that does not
qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The guidance was effective
January 1, 2015. The impact to the company will be dependent on any transaction
that is within the scope of the new guidance.
       In July 2013, the FASB
issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when
a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward exists. Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits
should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred
tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax
credit carryforward. The guidance was effective January 1, 2014. The
guidance was a change in financial statement presentation only and did not have
a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 
  In March 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on when foreign currency translation adjustments should be
released to net income. When a parent entity ceases to have a controlling
financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within
a foreign entity, the parent is required to release any related cumulative
translation adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation
adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer
results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign
entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2014 and did not have a material impact in the
consolidated financial results.  
     In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of
the guidance is fixed at the reporting date. Examples include debt
arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation matters. The
guidance requires an entity to measure such obligations as the sum of the
amount that the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement
among its co-obligors plus additional amounts the reporting entity expects to
pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance was effective January 1,
2014 and did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.

3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
       The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 
       Certain financial assets
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity
method investments that are recognized at fair value at the measurement date to
the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to
nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale
equity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In
the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a financial investment, fair
value is measured using a model described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. In the third quarter of 2014, the company recorded an
impairment on certain assets that were initially reported as held for sale at
September 30, 2014. See note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional
information. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 
       Accounting guidance permits the
measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other
accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied
the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2015 and December
31, 2014.

       There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the company
transferred trading security investments valued at $74 million from Level 2 to
Level 1 due to the expiration of certain regulatory restrictions.
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
 
Notes and other accounts receivable and
other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate
fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt
(excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities
with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in
the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.    
 
Loans and Long-term
Receivables
 
       Fair values are based on discounted future cash
flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with
similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the
difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and
long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the
financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level
3 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
 


13



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

Long-Term Debt
 
       Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is
based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an
asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market
price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates
currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $32,122 million and $35,073 million, and the estimated
fair value was $33,889 million and $37,524 million at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. If measured at fair value in the
financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be
classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities are
considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

       During the
fourth quarter of 2014, the company acquired equity securities in conjunction
with the sale of the industry standard server business which are classified as
available-for-sale securities. Gross unrealized losses of $99 million and $86 million related to
available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position.
 
       Based on an evaluation of available evidence as of
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the company believes that unrealized
losses on available-for-sale securities were temporary and did not represent a
need for an other-than-temporary impairment. In determining whether an
other-than-temporary decline in market value has occurred, the company
considers the duration that, and extent to which, the fair value of the
investment is below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects
of the issuer and the company’s intent and ability to retain the security in
order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. The duration of the
decline in market value of these securities has occurred over a short-term, and
the company has the ability to hold these securities and has no plans to sell
this investment prior to recovery of its cost basis.  
 
       Sales of debt and available-for-sale equity investments
during the period were as follows:

     The contractual
maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less
than one year at September 30, 2015.
 
Derivative
Financial Instruments 
 
       The company operates in multiple
functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global
markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact
of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser
extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company
limits these risks by following established risk management policies and
procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective,
financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For
interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements
between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease and other
financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt.
Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these
collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014 was $12 million and $21 million, respectively, for
which no collateral was posted at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Full collateralization of these
agreements would be required in the event that the company’s credit rating
falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250
basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security
arrangements. The
aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions as of
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $1,283 million and $1,432 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This
exposure was reduced by $180 million and $97 million at September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting 

15



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, this exposure was reduced by $193
million and $487 million of cash collateral, and $48 million and $31 million of
non-cash collateral in U.S. Treasury securities, respectively, received by the
company. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net exposure related
to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position was $862 million and $817 million, respectively.  At September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, the net exposure related to derivative liabilities
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $50 million
and $99 million, respectively.  
 
       In the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against
liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or
payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair
values of the related derivative instruments. No amount was recognized
in other receivables at September 30, 2015 or December 31, 2014 for the right
to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the
obligation to return cash collateral was $193 million and $487 million at
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash
collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in prepaid
expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position. No amount
was rehypothecated at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.  
 
       The company may employ derivative
instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders’ equity resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the
company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net
investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have
an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow
from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this
cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these
hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument
in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting
hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair
value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until
maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts,
interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the
underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative
instruments.
 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk,
follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The company issues debt in the global
capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan portfolios.
Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with
the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall
interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges).
At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of the
company’s interest rate swaps was $6.4 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.
The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014 was approximately 7.5 years and 8.7 years,
respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The company is exposed to interest
rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may
use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest
payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges.
The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program
outstanding at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       At
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, net gains of approximately $1 million
(before taxes) were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
in connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings. Within these
amounts, gains of less than $1 million are expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying transactions.
 
 
 
 
 
 

16



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

Foreign Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large portion of the company’s
foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net
investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’
equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional
currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The
company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts
for this risk management purpose. At September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments
designated as net investment hedges was $5.3 billion and $2.2 billion,
respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was approximately 0.2 years for both
periods.
 
Anticipated
Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The company’s operations generate
significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company’s
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these
foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency
markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to
manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as
cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $8.7 billion
and $9.3 billion, respectively.  The weighted-average remaining maturity of
these instruments at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was 0.6 years and
0.7 years, respectively.
 
       At
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in connection with cash flow hedges
of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains
of $226 million and $602 million (before taxes), respectively, in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $207 million and $572
million of gains, respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net income
within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the
underlying anticipated transactions. 
 
Foreign Currency
Denominated Borrowings
 
       The company is exposed to exchange
rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the
company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency
denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of
the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows is approximately seven years. At September 30, 2015 and December
31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under this program.
 
       At
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in connection with cash flow hedges
of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of
$2 million (before taxes) in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Within these amounts, less than $1 million of losses are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying exposure.      
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The company uses its Global Treasury
Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use
currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition,
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a
net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s
nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and
swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values
of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally
offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.
At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was
$10.8 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. 
 
Equity Risk
Management
 
       The company is exposed to market price
changes in certain broad market indices and in the company’s own stock
primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation 

17



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

obligations
are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as accounting
hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures,
to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation
obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market
indices or the total return on the company’s common stock, and are recorded at
fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.2 billion and $1.3
billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
       The company may hold warrants to
purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are
deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement
provisions. The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants
in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have
any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014.
 
       The company is exposed to a potential
loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company
may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures.
The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other
(income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have
any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at September
30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       The company is exposed to market
volatility on certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or
forwards to economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of investment securities was less than $0.1 billion for both
periods.
 
       The
following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and
non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity as of September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, as well as for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

assessment of hedge effectiveness (for fair value hedges), or associated with
an underlying exposure that did not or was not expected to occur (for cash flow
hedges); nor are there any anticipated in the normal course of business.

Net investment in sales-type and
direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$635 million and $671 million at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned
income of $525 million and $517 million, and net of the
allowance for credit losses of $222 million and $165 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses of $16 million and $17 million at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and
accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM
products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing
generally range from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan receivables and installment payment receivables (loans), net of the
allowance for credit losses of $371 million and $396 million at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily
to clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment
terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) financing contracts are
priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $593 million and $642 million at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing
receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at September
30, 2015 and December 31,
2014. The company determines its allowance
for credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan
receivables, and further segments the portfolio into two classes: major markets
and growth markets.

       When determining the allowances,
financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective
basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the
expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential
loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is
probable, the company records a specific reserve. In addition, the company
records an unallocated reserve that is determined by applying a reserve rate to
its different portfolios, excluding accounts that have been specifically
reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.  
 
Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
        The following table presents the recorded investment in financing
receivables which were on non-accrual status at September 30, 2015 and December
31, 2014.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit
quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available
information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically
based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical
rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service credit ratings as shown
below. The company uses information provided by Moody’s, where available, as one
of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings.
 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
Receivables with a credit quality
indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others
are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not
reflect mitigation actions that the company may take to transfer credit risk to
third parties.

        Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $39 million compared to
the corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related
to performance share units ($31 million), restricted stock units ($7 million)
and in the company’s assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by
acquired entities ($1 million). Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $48 million compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related to
performance share units ($37 million), restricted stock units ($3 million) and
the company’s assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired
entities ($8 million).
 
       The amount of
stock-based compensation cost included in the loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was immaterial in all periods.
 
       As of
September 30, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $927 million related to
non-vested awards was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.7 years.
 
       There was no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at September 30, 2015 and
2014.
 
6. Segments:  
The tables on pages 28 and 29 reflect the results of continuing operations of
the company’s segments consistent with the management and measurement system
utilized within the company. Performance
measurement is based on pre-tax income from continuing operations. These
results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker, both in
evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the
segments.
 
       In January 2015, the company’s
business process outsourcing business, Global Process Services, which was previously
managed within Global Technology Services, was integrated into Global Business
Services, creating an end-to-end business transformation capability for clients
and to better leverage the company’s industry knowledge. The following tables
reflect this reclassification for the prior-year periods.

       In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Spain issued a ruling in
litigation involving IBM Spain’s defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution
(DC) plans. As a result of this ruling, the company recorded a pre-tax
retirement-related obligation of $148 million in 2014 ($55 million in the first
quarter; $20 million in the third
quarter; and $73 million in the fourth
quarter) in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Constitutional Court denied IBM Spain’s
requested leave to appeal the decision. In March 2015, the National Audience
Court issued a ruling that, in part, required IBM to stop making DC contributions
and also ruled that the company should promptly reinstate the DB plan. As a
result of this ruling, in the first quarter of 2015, the company recorded an
additional pre-tax retirement-related obligation of $230 million in SG&A in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These obligations are reflected in
"Non-U.S. Plans - Multi-employer plans/other costs" in the tables
above. IBM Spain appealed that ruling and in May 2015, the National Audience
Court dismissed the appeal. See note 12, "Contingencies" for
additional information.
 
       In 2015, the company expects to contribute to its
non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans approximately $600 million, which will be
mainly contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in the UK, Japan, the
Netherlands and Spain. This amount represents the legally mandated minimum
contribution. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first nine
months of 2015 were $271 million.

9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:  
 
Acquisitions:
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the company completed seven
acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $782 million.
 
The Software segment completed acquisitions of
six privately held businesses: in the first quarter, AlchemyAPI, Inc. (AlchemyAPI)
and Blekko, Inc. (Blekko); in the second quarter, Explorys, Inc. (Explorys) and
Phytel, Inc. (Phytel); and in the third quarter, Compose, Inc. (Compose) and
StrongLoop, Inc. (StrongLoop). Global Technology Services (GTS) completed one
acquisition: in the second quarter, Blue Box Group, Inc. (Blue Box), a
privately held company.
 
Each acquisition is expected to enhance the
company’s portfolio of product and services capabilities.  AlchemyAPI is a
leading provider of scalable cognitive computing application program interface
services and computing applications. Blekko technology provides advanced
Web-crawling, categorization and intelligent filtering. Explorys provides
secure cloud-based solutions for clinical integration, at-risk population
management, cost of care measurement and pay-for-performance. Phytel is a
leading provider of SaaS based population health management offerings that help
providers identify patients at risk for care gaps and engage the patient to
begin appropriate preventative care. Blue Box provides hosted, managed,
OpenStack-based production-grade private clouds for the enterprise and service
provider markets. Compose offers auto-scaling, production-ready databases to help
software development teams deploy data services efficiently. StrongLoop is a
leading provider of application development software that enables software
developers to build applications using application programming interfaces.
Purchase price consideration for these acquisitions as reflected in the
following table, was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
       The following table reflects the
purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price
allocations as of September 30, 2015.

        The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity were recorded
at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items
that generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
businesses and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. The
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 5.8 years. These
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives.
Goodwill of $574 million was assigned to the Software segment and goodwill of
$62 million was assigned to the GTS segment. It is expected that 1 percent of the
goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. 
 
       On
September 24, 2015, the company announced it had entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire the remaining shares of Advanced Application Corporation
(AAC), an affiliate of JBCC Holdings Inc. and IBM Japan Ltd. AAC engages in
system integration application development, software support and services. The
acquisition closed on October 1, 2015. 
 
On September 28, 2015, the company announced that it had
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Meteorix LLC (Meteorix), a
privately held company based in Boston, Massachusetts. Meteorix offers
consulting, deployment, integrations and on-going post production services for
Workday Financial Management and Human Capital Management (HCM) applications.
The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
On October 5, 2015, the company announced that it had
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cleversafe Inc. (Cleversafe), a
privately held company based in Chicago, Illinois. Cleversafe is a leading developer
and manufacturer of object-based storage software and appliances. The
acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
On October 13, 2015, the company announced that
it had closed the acquisition of Merge Healthcare Incorporated (Merge), a
public company located in Chicago, Illinois. Merge is a leading provider of
medical image handling and processing, interoperability and clinical systems
designed to advance healthcare quality and efficiency. The enterprise value of
the transaction was approximately $1 billion.
 
At the date of issuance of the financial
statements, the initial purchase accounting for the AAC and Merge transactions
was not complete.


Divestitures: 
 
        Microelectronics – On October 20,
2014, IBM and GLOBALFOUNDRIES announced a definitive agreement in which
GLOBALFOUNDRIES would acquire the company’s Microelectronics business,
including existing semiconductor manufacturing assets and operations in East
Fishkill, NY and Essex Junction, VT. The commercial OEM business to be acquired
by GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes custom logic and specialty foundry, manufacturing
and related operations. The transaction closed on July 1, 2015.
 
       The transaction includes a 10-year
exclusive manufacturing sourcing agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES will
provide server processor semiconductor technology for use in IBM Systems. The
agreement provides the company with capacity and market-based pricing for
current semiconductor nodes in production and progression to nodes in the
future for 

37



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

both development and production needs.
As part of the transaction, the company will provide GLOBALFOUNDRIES with
certain transition services, including IT, supply chain, packaging and test
services and lab services. The initial term for these transition services is
one to three years, with GLOBALFOUNDRIES having the ability to renew. 
 
       In the third quarter of 2014, the
company recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.7 billion related to the sale of the
Microelectronics disposal group, which was part of the Systems Hardware
reportable segment. The pre-tax charge reflected the fair value less the
estimated cost of selling the disposal group including an impairment to the
semiconductor long-lived assets of $2.4 billion, $1.5 billion representing the
cash consideration expected to be transferred to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and $0.8
billion of other related costs. Additional pre-tax charges of $108 million were
recorded in the first nine months of 2015 related to the disposal. The
cumulative pre-tax charge was $4.8 billion as of September 30, 2015. Additional
charges may be recorded in future periods. 
 
       All assets and liabilities of the
business, which were held for sale at June 30, 2015, were transferred at
closing. The company transferred $515 million of net cash to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in
the third quarter of 2015. This amount included $750 million of cash
consideration, adjusted by the amount of working capital due from
GLOBALFOUNDRIES and other miscellaneous items. The remaining cash consideration
will be transferred over three years.
       Reporting the related assets and
liabilities initially as held for sale at September 30, 2014 was based on
meeting all of the criteria for such reporting in the applicable accounting
guidance. While the company met certain criteria for held for sale reporting in
prior periods, it did not meet all of the criteria until September 30, 2014. In
addition, at September 30, 2014, the company concluded that the
Microelectronics business met the criteria for discontinued operations
reporting. The disposal group constitutes a component under accounting
guidance. The continuing cash inflows and outflows with the discontinued
component are related to the manufacturing sourcing arrangement and the
transition, packaging and test services. These cash flows are not direct cash
flows as they are not significant and the company will have no significant
continuing involvement. 
 
Summarized financial information for
discontinued operations is shown in the tables below.

agreement in which Lenovo would acquire the company’s industry standard server
portfolio (System x) for an adjusted purchase price of $2.1 billion, consisting
of approximately $1.8 billion in cash, with the balance in Lenovo common stock.
The stock represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in Lenovo. The
company would sell to Lenovo its System x,

BladeCenter
and Flex System blade servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems,
NeXtScale and iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and
maintenance operations.
 
IBM and Lenovo entered into a strategic
relationship which included a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales of
IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems, tape
storage systems, General Parallel File System software, SmartCloud Entry
offering, and elements of IBM’s system software, including Systems Director and
Platform Computing solutions. Effective with the initial closing of the
transaction, Lenovo assumed related customer service and maintenance
operations. IBM will continue to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s
behalf for an extended period of time. In addition, as part of the transaction
agreement, the company will provide Lenovo with certain transition services,
including IT and supply chain services. The initial term for these transition
services ranges from less than one year to three years. Lenovo can renew
certain services for an additional year.
 
The initial closing was completed on
October 1, 2014. A subsequent closing occurred in most other countries in which
there was a large business footprint on December 31, 2014. The remaining countries closed on March 31,
2015 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $16 million in the first quarter of 2015. In
the second quarter of 2015, an additional pre-tax gain of $36 million was
recorded attributed to certain adjustments resolved during the quarter. No
material adjustments were recorded during the third quarter of 2015.
 
Overall, the company continues to expect to
recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.5 billion, which does not include associated costs related to
transition and performance-based costs. Net of these charges, the pre-tax gain
is approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.1 billion was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2014. The balance of the gain is
expected to be recognized in 2019 upon conclusion of the maintenance agreement.  
 
Customer Care – On
September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a definitive agreement in which SYNNEX
would acquire the company’s worldwide customer care business process
outsourcing services business for $501 million, consisting of approximately
$430 million in cash, net of balance sheet adjustments, and $71 million in
SYNNEX common stock, which represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in
SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered into a multi-year agreement
with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s outsourcing business, became an IBM
strategic business partner for global customer care business process
outsourcing services. 
 
The initial closing was completed on January 31, 2014, with
subsequent closings occurring in 2014. For the
full year of 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million related
to this transaction. 
 
       In  the second quarter of 2015, resolution of
the final balance sheet adjustments was concluded.  In the third quarter of
2015, adjustments made to certain remaining provisions resulted in the
recognition of an additional $2 million pre-tax gain. Through September 30,
2015, the cumulative pre-tax gain attributed to this transaction was $210
million. 
 
Retail Store Solutions – On April 17, 2012, the company announced
that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba TEC for the sale of its
Retail Store Solutions business. As part of the transaction, the company agreed
to transfer the maintenance business to Toshiba TEC within three years of the
original closing of the transaction.
 
The company completed the final phase of the
transfer of the maintenance workforce to Toshiba in the second quarter of 2015.
The parts and inventory transfer to Toshiba will commence in the fourth quarter
of 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2016. An assessment of the ongoing
contractual terms of the transaction resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax
gain of $8 million in the third quarter of 2015.
 
        Overall, the company has recognized a
cumulative total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $518 million. 
Others ‒ In the
second quarter of 2015, the company completed the divestiture of its Travel
& Transportation kiosk business to Embross North America Ltd., and the divestiture
of its Telecom Expense Management product to Tangoe, Inc.  
 
       In the first quarter of 2015, the company
completed the divestiture of the Algorithmics Collateral Management suite of
products to SmartStream, Inc. and the divestiture of the Commerce ILOG Supply
Chain Optimization Tools suite of products to Llamasoft, Inc. 
 
The financial terms of each transaction
were not material.

     The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$328 million during the first
nine months of 2015, primarily due to amortization, partially offset by
intangible asset additions resulting from capitalized software and
acquisitions. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $290 million and $884 million
for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively, versus $339 million and $1,018 million
for the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively. In addition,
in the first nine months of 2015, the company retired $1,608 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.  
 
     The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following
at September 30, 2015:

*      The portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt obligations
that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
as an amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying value plus a fair value
adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt
obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates.
 
       The company’s indenture governing its debt
securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants
which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the
aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10 percent of the company’s
consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge
or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also
include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio,
which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 
       The company is in compliance with all of its
significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders.
The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of
default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain
events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to
which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.  
        Pre-swap annual contractual maturities of
long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2015, are as follows:

12.  Contingencies:   As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries,
IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a
leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will
continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated
products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement
and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company
enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations,
lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and
scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions
involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters
related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may
involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel
questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters
arise.
 
       The company records a provision with
respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Any
recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015 were not material to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
      
In accordance with the relevant
accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the
likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the
company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and
qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the
industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.
 
      
With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any
material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court
rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With
respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed in this Note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is
unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses,
including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following
reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters. It is the company’s experience that damage amounts claimed in
litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as
such are not meaningful indicators of the company’s potential liability.
Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of
other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in
question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing
discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company
reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and
decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and
disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in
the aggregate), to reflect the impact 

43



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

and status of
settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews
by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter.
 
       Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined
in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a
material effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the
timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such
remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies
may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances
of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the
company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of
these matters.
 
       The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.
 
      
The company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux
and the company has asserted counterclaims. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff
filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed.
The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in
March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare
copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize
Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX
license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In
June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v.
IBM case, and proceedings have resumed in that case.      
 
 
On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on
behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one
another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social
service program processing in Indiana. The State terminated the contract,
claiming that IBM was in breach, and the State is seeking damages. IBM believes
the State’s claims against it are without merit and is seeking payment of
termination amounts specified in the contract. After six weeks of trial, on
July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the State’s
claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed
portions of the trial judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and
ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to determine the State's damages,
if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of
the trial court's award of damages to IBM. This matter remains pending in the
Indiana courts.
 
      
 On April 16, 2014, Iusacell SA de C.V.
(Iusacell) sued IBM, claiming that IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations that
induced Iusacell to enter into an agreement with IBM Mexico. Iusacell claims
damages for lost profits. Iusacell’s complaint relates to a contractual dispute
in Mexico, which is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico
initiated by IBM Mexico against Iusacell for breach of the underlying
agreement.   On November 14, 2014, the District Court in the Southern
District of New York granted IBM's motion to stay Iusacell's action against the
company pending the arbitration in Mexico between Iusacell and IBM Mexico.
 
      
IBM United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal proceedings in May 2010
before the High Court in London against the IBM UK Pensions Trust (the UK
Trust) and two representative beneficiaries of the UK Trust membership. IBM UK
is seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully both in notifying the Trustee
of the UK Trust that it was closing its UK defined benefit plans to future
accruals for most participants and in implementing the company’s new retirement
policy. In April 2014, the High Court acknowledged that the changes made to its
UK defined benefit plans were within IBM’s discretion, but ruled that IBM
breached its implied duty of good faith both in implementing these changes and
in the manner in which it consulted with employees. Proceedings to determine
remedies were held in July 2014, and in February 2015 the High Court held that
for IBM to make changes to accruals under the plan would require a new
consultation of the participants, but other changes (including to early
retirement policy) would not require such consultation. IBM UK has appealed
both the breach and remedies judgments and a decision is not expected until at
least 2016. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the
Court’s rulings would require IBM to reverse the changes made to the UK defined
benefit plans retroactive to their effective dates. This could result in an
estimated non-operating one-time pre-tax charge of approximately $250 million,
plus ongoing defined benefit related accruals.  In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290
individual actions brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined
benefits plans who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive
dismissal and age discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in
Southampton UK.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       On March 24, 2014, in a suit brought by local Works Councils, the
Supreme Court of Spain held that IBM Spain’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan
implemented in 1993 based on the voluntary participation of its employees was
null and void. The Supreme Court also held that current employees could
reinstate their rights to a Defined Benefit (DB) Plan, although with an offset
for DC contributions paid to date. The Court held that IBM Spain did not
consult with the Works Councils in seeking to change the pension scheme, and
recommended that IBM Spain and the Works Councils engage in discussions over
how to carry out the offset. The Constitutional Court denied IBM Spain’s
requested leave to appeal the decision. In March 2015, the National Audience
Court ruled that the Works Council was not entitled to dictate the means by
which IBM should carry out the offset of DC contributions, but also ruled that
the Supreme Court's judgment could be executed without the need for individual
lawsuits by employees, rejecting the position that the judgment was declaratory
only. The National Audience Court also ruled that IBM should stop making DC
contributions, and that the company should promptly reinstate the DB Plan. IBM Spain appealed that ruling and in May 2015, the National Audience Court
dismissed the appeal.  IBM continues to reexamine its business model as it reinstitutes an
outdated pension plan that employees elected to forego 20 years ago, which
benefits a limited subset of the overall population of employees in Spain. The
Works Councils continue to challenge IBM’s implementation approach.     
 
       In March 2011, the company announced that it had
agreed to settle a civil enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) relating to alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA). On July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011
settlement and required that for a two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC
and the court on certain matters, including those relating to compliance with
the FCPA. The two-year period expired in July 2015. In early 2012, IBM notified
the SEC of an investigation by the Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau
involving allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM Poland employee in
connection with sales to the Polish government. IBM is cooperating with the SEC
and Polish authorities in this matter. In April 2013, IBM learned that the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating
allegations related to the Poland matter, as well as allegations relating to
transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The DOJ is also seeking information
regarding the company's global FCPA compliance program and its public sector
business. The company is cooperating with the DOJ in this matter.
 
In March 2015, putative class action litigation
was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York related to the company's October 2014 announcement that it was
divesting its global commercial semiconductor technology business. The company
and three of its officers are named as defendants. Plaintiffs allege that
defendants violated Sections 20(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In May 2015, a
related putative class action was also commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York based on the same underlying facts,
alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The
company, management’s Retirement Plans Committee, and three current or former
IBM executives are named as defendants.
 
In August 2015, IBM learned that the SEC is
conducting an investigation relating to revenue recognition with respect to the
accounting treatment of certain transactions in the U.S., U.K. and
Ireland. The company is cooperating with the SEC in this matter.
 
       The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the
Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and
claim damages in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and
property damages allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater
contamination and vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain
structures in which plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business,
allegedly resulting from the release of chemicals into the environment by the
company at its former manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These
complaints also seek punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The
company has reached an agreement in principle to settle substantially all of these
cases.
 
      
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
       The company is also
subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various
jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil,
the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding
non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total
potential amount related to 

45



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

these matters for all
applicable years is approximately $450 million. The company believes it will
prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of
liability.
 
13. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $5,972 million and $5,365 million at September 30,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. A portion of these amounts was
available to the company’s business partners to support their working capital
needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to
its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately
$1,888 million and $1,816 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014,
respectively.
 
       The company has applied the guidance
requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the
likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The following is a
description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party
with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the
context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the
assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically indemnification
provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the company’s payment, the
company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time
and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse
against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $35 million and $46 million at September
30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.

14. Subsequent
Events: On October 27, 2015, the company announced that the Board of
Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per common share. The dividend
is payable December 10, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 10, 2015. 
 
       On October 27, 2015,
the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized $4.0 billion in
additional funds for use in the company’s stock repurchase program.

Organization of Information:
 
       In October 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business. The assets and
liabilities of the Microelectronics business were reported as held for sale at
December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. The operating results of the
Microelectronics business are reported as discontinued operations. The
transaction closed on July 1, 2015. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015,
the company renamed its Systems & Technology segment to Systems Hardware
and its System z brand to z Systems. 
 
Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on pages 78 and 79 for additional information.
  

 
Divestitures:
 
       In 2014
and 2015, the company completed the divestitures of its customer care process
outsourcing business to SYNNEX and its industry standard server business
(System x) to Lenovo. For the customer care transaction, the initial closing
date was January 31, 2014. For the System x transaction, the initial closing
date was October 1, 2014. The company presents certain financial results in the
Management Discussion excluding the effects of the customer care and/or the
System x business divestitures. The company believes that presenting financial
information without either or both of these items is more representative of
operational performance and provides insights into, and clarifies the basis
for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to users of
the financial statements. 

48



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
Operating
(non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
        In an effort to provide better transparency into the
operational results of the business, the company separates business results
into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing
operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain
acquisition-related charges, retirement-related costs, discontinued operations
and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings exclude the
amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable
restructuring and related expenses and tax charges related to acquisition
integration. For retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain
items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes defined
benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost,
amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans
in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost includes defined
benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected
return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any
plan curtailments/settlements and multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency
costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily
related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to
financial market performance and the company considers these costs to be
outside the operational performance of the business.
 
       Overall, the company believes that providing
investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides
increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the
business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves
visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational
performance; enables better comparisons to peer companies; and allows the
company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The
company’s reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from
continuing operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement
system.
 
      
 The following table provides the company’s (non-GAAP)
operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 and 2014.

Financial
Performance Summary – Three Months Ended September 30:
 
       In the
third quarter of 2015, the company delivered $19.3 billion in revenue, $3.0
billion in income from continuing operations and $3.3 billion in operating
(non-GAAP) earnings resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $3.02 as reported and $3.34 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The
results of continuing operations exclude a net loss from discontinued
operations of $12 million in the third quarter of 2015 and a net loss of $3.4
billion in the third quarter of 2014 related to the divestiture of the Microelectronics
business. On a consolidated basis, net income in the third quarter of 2015 was
$3.0 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $3.01. 
 
       For some
time, the company has been describing the tremendous change in the industry as
its clients move to new areas, get greater value from their data and IT
environments and implement new business models. As the company transforms the
business, it has been investing where it sees higher value over the longer
term, driving growth in these higher value areas, while other areas decline as
it shifts the business. The company’s third-quarter results reflect the
progress being made in this transformation. The company’s strategic imperatives
continued to grow at a strong double-digit rate. Both gross and net operating
(non-GAAP) margins expanded year to year in the third quarter. The company
generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations and $2.6 billion in free cash
flow in the third quarter and continued a high level of investment, while
returning $2.8 billion to shareholders in gross common stock repurchases and
dividends. 
 

49



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       Total consolidated
revenue decreased 13.9 percent as reported, but 1 percent year to year adjusted
for the System x divestiture and currency in the third quarter of 2015. The year-to-year
revenue performance included the impact of currency (9 points or $1.9 billion)
and the divested System x business (4 points). Revenue in the quarter fell
short of the company’s own expectations. The Global Business Services (GBS)
transformation is taking longer as the market shifts away from some of the more
traditional application areas, and the Storage disk business was weaker as more
of the demand moves to the company’s flash products. In addition, while
Software performance in the third quarter was consistent with performance in
the first half of 2015, there was some weakness in transactions at the end of
the quarter.  
 
       Revenue in the strategic imperatives‒cloud,
analytics, social, mobile and security‒grew 17 percent year to year as
reported and 27 percent adjusted for currency and the System x divestiture in
the third quarter. Cloud revenue was up more than 35 percent as reported and
over 50 percent year to year adjusted for currency and the divestiture. For the
12 months ending September 30, 2015, cloud revenue was $9.4 billion and the
company exited the quarter with an annual-as-a-Service run rate of $4.5 billion
compared to $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Business analytics
revenue grew 4 percent as reported and 13 percent adjusted for currency.
Revenue in the areas of engagement–mobile, social and security– nearly doubled
year to year in the third quarter on both an as reported and adjusted for
currency basis. Security revenue increased 11 percent as reported (18 percent
adjusted for currency), mobile revenue quadrupled and social revenue increased
24 percent (more than 30 percent adjusted for currency). 
 
        From
a segment perspective, the company made additional progress in its transformation
and shift to the strategic imperatives. For example, Global Technology Services
(GTS) is bringing more cloud, mobile and security to infrastructure services
for new clients and to assist existing clients move to the future. GTS
performance in the third quarter reflects growth in revenue, adjusted for
currency and the System x divestiture, and growth in the backlog at constant
currency. Additionally, in the Systems Hardware business, the company has
repositioned the portfolio and delivered innovation as these systems run the
most contemporary workloads. Throughout 2015, the Systems Hardware business has
had strong growth in z Systems and continued success in Power Systems.     
 
       The company is continuing to invest and add
capabilities to accelerate the shift to higher value and to advance the
transformation of the business. In the third quarter, the company committed
additional capital, including:
      
·       The acquisition of Merge Healthcare to give Watson the
ability to “see” millions of medical images, 
·        
The acquisitions of Cleversafe, Compose,
StrongLoop and Meteorix, each bolstering the company’s cloud    
     capabilities, and 
·        The launch of the industry’s first consulting practice
dedicated to cognitive business. 
            
       The company’s approach is to integrate acquired
content with its own organic capabilities, and leverage partnerships and a
broader ecosystem to build new high value platforms such as Watson, SoftLayer,
Bluemix and OpenPOWER.       

 
       In the third quarter, Global Services revenue
declined 11.2 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (10
points) and the divestiture. GTS declined 10.2 percent as reported, but
increased 1 percent adjusted for currency (11 points) and the divestiture (1
point). On an adjusted basis, GTS revenue has increased in six of the last
seven quarters. GBS revenue decreased 13.1 percent as reported and 5 percent
adjusted for currency. GBS has been shifting resources and investing to drive
growth in the strategic imperatives, however weakness in consulting,
specifically around enterprise applications, has impacted overall performance.
Software revenue declined 10.0 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) which
was consistent with performance over the past year. Growth across the solution
areas of security, analytics and social were more than offset by a continuing
headwind from operating systems and a decline in transactional revenue. Systems
Hardware revenue decreased 38.7 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for
the divested System x business (34 points) and currency (3 points). Adjusted
for currency, there was double-digit growth in z Systems, and growth in Power
Systems capturing both the UNIX and Linux opportunity. Storage revenue
decreased 18.6 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency) year to year in a
challenging market.  
 
  From a geographic perspective, revenue
in the major markets declined 11.2 percent as reported and 1 percent year to
year adjusted for currency (8 points) and the divestiture (3 points). On an
adjusted basis, a revenue decline in the U.S. was partially offset by growth in
Japan and Germany with sequential revenue performance improvement in the UK,
France and Canada. Growth markets revenue decreased 22.4 percent as reported
and 3 percent adjusted for currency (11 points) and the divested business (8
points) with growth in Latin America and Middle East and Africa more than
offset by declines in Asia Pacific on an adjusted basis. On that basis, this
represented a 2 point sequential improvement from second-quarter 2015
year-to-year performance. Revenue in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China)
countries declined 30.1 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency
(12 points) and the divestiture (11 points). On an adjusted basis, revenue
performance in each of the four countries improved year to year compared to the
second quarter of 2015.

  The consolidated gross profit margin
of 48.9 percent increased 0.4 points versus the prior year. The operating
(non-GAAP) gross margin of 50.0 percent increased 0.8 points compared to the
prior year driven by a shift to higher value, primarily through portfolio
actions and the relative strength of z Systems, partially offset by investments
and contract mix in the Global Services business. 
 
  Total expense and other (income)
decreased 10.7 percent in the third quarter of 2015 versus the prior year.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 11.5 percent
compared to the prior year. The year-to-year drivers were approximately:

       The
reduction in expense was driven primarily by currency and the fact that the
divested System x business is no longer in the spending base. These benefits
were partially offset by a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges ($0.1
billion). The reduction in operating (non-GAAP) expense was driven by the same
factors. The company is continuing to shift spending within its large
operational expense base; driving productivity and efficiency in some areas,
while increasing investment in support of the strategic imperatives. 
 
       Pre-tax
income from continuing operations of $3.6 billion decreased 17.0 percent year
to year. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of
2015 was 18.2 percent, a decrease of 2.6 points versus the prior year. Income
from continuing operations of $3.0 billion decreased 14.3 percent and the net
income margin was 15.4 percent, essentially flat versus the third quarter of
2014. Losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $12 million in the
third quarter of 2015 and $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Net income
of $3.0 billion increased $2.9 billion year to year. Operating (non-GAAP)
pre-tax income from continuing operations of $4.0 billion decreased 13.9
percent year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of
$3.3 billion decreased 10.9 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin
from continuing operations of 17.0 percent increased 0.6 points. The operating
(non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the third quarter
of 2015 was 18.0 percent versus 20.8 percent in the third quarter of 2014. The lower tax rates year to year reflect discrete period
benefits in the third quarter of 2015.  
 
  Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations of $3.02 decreased 12.7 percent year to year. In the
third quarter of 2015, the company repurchased 9.8 million shares of its common
stock. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.34 decreased 9.2
percent versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued
operations was ($0.01) in the third quarter of 2015 compared to ($3.44) in the
third quarter of 2014.
     
      The company generated $4.2 billion in cash flow
provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.3 billion when compared to
the third quarter of 2014, driven primarily by lower cash tax payments,
partially offset by operational performance. Net cash used in investing
activities of $1.3 billion was $0.5 billion higher than the prior year,
primarily due to the net payment made in the third quarter of 2015 associated
with the Microelectronics divestiture. Net cash used in financing activities of
$1.8 billion decreased $1.0 billion compared to the third quarter of 2014,
driven primarily by higher net cash proceeds from total debt. 
  
       The third quarter results are a reflection of the
transformation in the company’s business as it moves to areas with longer-term high
value in enterprise IT. This is a longer term strategy. The company is creating
new platforms and building ecosystems, much of this is an as-a-Services model.
The company continues to invest at a higher level as it shifts its spending to
the strategic imperatives. In October 2015, the company disclosed that it
expects to deliver GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations
in the range of $13.25 to $14.25, and it expects to deliver operating
(non-GAAP) earnings between $14.75 and $15.75 per diluted share from continuing
operations for 2015. The company also stated that it expects free cash flow in
2015 to be relatively flat year to year. See the Looking Forward section on
pages 77 and 78 for additional information on the company’s expectations.

Financial Performance Summary – Nine Months Ended September
30:
 
        In the first nine months of 2015, the
company reported $59.7 billion in revenue, and delivered $8.9 billion in income
from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $9.03 as reported and $10.09 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
The results of continuing operations exclude a net loss from discontinued
operations of $0.2 billion in the first nine months of 2015 and a net loss of
$3.7 billion in the first nine months of 2014 related to the divestiture of the
Microelectronics business. On a consolidated basis, net income in the first
nine months of 2015 was $8.7 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $8.85.
The company generated $11.7 billion in cash from operations and $7.0 billion in
free cash flow in the first nine months of 2015 enabling shareholder returns of
$7.5 billion in gross common stock repurchases and dividends. Over the past 12
months, the company has generated $13.6 million in free cash flow, with
realization of reported net income over 90 percent. In that same period, the
company has reduced outstanding shares by 2 percent, and increased its dividend
– returning approximately two-thirds of free cash flow to shareholders.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       The company continues to transform
the business as it moves to where the company sees the longer-term high value
in enterprise IT. In the first nine months of 2015, the company has expanded
operational (non-GAAP) margins on a relatively stable revenue base, adjusted
for currency and divestitures, while going through a transformation and
reinventing the business. The company has maintained high levels of investment
in research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions as it shifts
spending to the strategic imperatives. The investments have provided returns as
evidenced by the strong revenue growth in the strategic imperatives. At the
same time, the core business is declining – in a declining market – as the
company delivers productivity to its clients for reinvestment in the new areas.

 
  Total consolidated revenue decreased
13.1 percent as reported and 1 percent year to year adjusted for divestitures
and currency in the first nine months of 2015. Currency had an 8 point, or $5.7
billion impact on reported revenue in the nine month period. Additionally,
revenue was impacted by 4 points in the first nine months of 2015 from divested
businesses. Combined, the impact of currency and divested businesses reduced
the reported revenue growth by 12 points. 
 
       In the first nine months of 2015, strategic
imperatives revenue grew 20 percent year to year as reported, and more than 30
percent adjusted for currency and divestitures. Cloud revenue was up over 45
percent as reported and over 65 percent year to year adjusted for currency and
divestitures. The company had strong year-to-year performance in both its
private foundations and as-a-Service offerings. Business analytics revenue
increased 9 percent as reported and 19 percent adjusted for currency. In the
area of engagement–security, social, mobile–revenue nearly doubled compared to
the first nine months of 2014 at constant currency. Security revenue increased
6 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency), mobile revenue
quadrupled and social revenue increased 32 percent as reported (approximately 40
percent adjusted for currency).    
 
       From a segment perspective, Global Services revenue
declined 11.3 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (10
points) and divestitures. GTS revenue declined 10.5 percent as reported, but
was essentially flat adjusted for currency (10 points) and divestitures (1
point). GBS revenue decreased 12.7 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted
for currency (9 points) and divestitures. Software revenue declined 9.5 percent
and 3 percent adjusted for currency. Key branded middleware decreased 6.5
percent as reported, but was essentially flat year to year at constant
currency. Systems Hardware revenue decreased 31.4 percent as reported, but
increased 10 percent adjusted for the divested System x business (37 points) and
currency (4 points). 
 
       From a
geographic perspective, revenue in the major markets declined 11.0 percent as
reported, but was flat year to year adjusted for currency (8 points) and
divestitures (3 points) with growth in Japan, Germany and the UK on an adjusted
basis. Growth markets revenue decreased 20.1 percent as reported and 3 percent
adjusted for divestitures (9 points) and currency (9 points) compared to the
first nine months of 2014. Performance was driven by the BRIC countries, down
29.1 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for divestitures (11 points)
and currency (8 points). 
 
       The consolidated gross margin of
49.1 percent increased 0.2 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) gross
margin of 50.1 percent increased 0.6 points versus the prior year primarily
driven by the shift to higher value through both portfolio actions and the
relative strength of z Systems, partially offset by margin declines in Global
Services. 
 
       Total expense and other (income)
decreased 10.8 percent in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the prior
year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 12.5
percent compared to the first nine months of 2014. The key year-to-year drivers
were:

       The reduction in expense
was driven primarily by currency impacts, a lower level of workforce
rebalancing charges ($0.3 billion) and the impact of the divested System x
business. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower divestiture
gains ($0.3 billion) year to year and additional pension obligations related to
litigation in Spain ($0.2 billion). The reduction in operating (non-GAAP)
expense was driven by the same factors, excluding the Spain pension impact
which was not reflected in operating (non-GAAP) expense. The company is
continuing to shift resources and spending to strategic areas with the most
opportunity. The company is on track to shift $4 billion of spending across
expense, cost and capital expenditures, to the strategic imperatives.

       Pre-tax
income from continuing operations decreased 15.9 percent and the pre-tax margin
was 18.2 percent, a decrease of 0.6 points versus the first nine months of
2014. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first nine months of
2015 was 17.9 percent, a decrease of 2.7 points versus the prior year. Income
from continuing operations of $8.9 billion decreased 13.0 percent and the net
income margin was 14.9 percent, flat compared to the first nine months of 2014.
Losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $0.2 billion in the first
nine months of 2015 versus $3.7 billion in the first nine months of 2014. Net
income of $8.7 billion increased 33.5 percent year to year. Operating
(non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations decreased 11.4 percent
year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing
operations improved 0.4 points to 20.4 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income
from continuing operations of $10.0 billion decreased 8.8 percent and the
operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 16.7 percent
increased 0.8 points. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from
continuing operations in the first nine months of 2015 was 18.3 percent versus
20.6 percent in the first nine months of 2014. The
tax rates in the first nine months of 2015 reflected a benefit from certain
discrete items. 
 
       Diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.03 decreased 10.5 percent
year to year. In the first nine months of 2015, the company repurchased 24.3
million shares of its common stock. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per
share of $10.09 decreased 6.2 percent versus the prior year. Diluted earnings
per share from discontinued operations was ($0.18) in the first nine months of
2015 compared to ($3.65) in the same period of 2014.
  
       At September 30, 2015, the company continued to have
the financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $9.6 billion, an increase of $1.1
billion from December 31, 2014. Key drivers in the balance sheet were:
 
    Total assets decreased $8.9 billion
($3.8 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2014 driven by:
 
    ·        Decreases in total receivables ($8.3 billion), deferred
taxes ($1.5 billion) and prepaid expenses and sundry assets ($0.8 billion);
partially offset by
 
    ·       
Increased prepaid pension assets ($1.9
billion) and increased cash ($1.0 billion).
 
  Total liabilities decreased $10.3 billion ($7.0 billion
adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2014 driven by:
 
   ·   Decreases
in other liabilities ($2.3 billion), taxes ($2.2 billion), accounts payable
($1.7 billion), deferred income ($1.5 billion), retirement-related liabilities
($1.2 billion), and total debt ($1.1 billion). 
 
  Total equity of $13.5 billion increased $1.4 billion from
December 31, 2014 as a result of:
 
   ·       Higher retained earnings ($5.1 billion) and higher common
stock ($0.6 billion); partially offset by
 
   ·       
Increased treasury stock ($4.0 billion) and
increased accumulated other comprehensive losses ($0.3 billion).
 
       The company generated $11.7 billion in cash flow provided
by operating activities, an increase of $0.9 billion compared to the first nine
months of 2014, driven primarily by lower income tax payments, partially offset
by operational performance. Net cash used in investing activities of $2.7
billion was $0.9 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by an
increase in net cash used related to acquisitions and divestitures. Net cash
used in financing activities of $7.8 billion decreased $1.9 billion compared to
the first nine months of 2014, driven primarily by a decrease in cash used for
gross common stock repurchases ($9.7 billion), partially offset by lower net
debt issuances ($7.0 billion).

       Global Technology Services revenue of $7,937 million
decreased 10.2 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency
(11 points) and the System x divestiture (1 point) in the third quarter of 2015
compared to the prior year. For the first nine months of the year, GTS revenue
decreased 10.5 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency (10
points) and the System x divestiture (1 point). On an adjusted basis, GTS
revenue has grown in six of the last seven quarters. 
 
       In the third quarter, GTS outsourcing revenue of
$4,197 million decreased 11.4 percent as reported and was flat year to year
adjusted for currency. The outsourcing business is based on long term
partnerships, where clients entrust the company with the most important
elements of their businesses, looking to the company to deliver innovation to
help them transform their enterprises. The company is reinventing its
portfolio, providing the most modern IT services that connect clients to the
cloud-based mobile world, and this is showing up in the business being signed.
Clients are choosing to partner with the company because the company can move
their operations into the future. The company takes over client IT systems and
moves them to the cloud, while ensuring integration with their existing
infrastructure. This makes them more efficient and ultimately drives
competitive advantages. The company’s capabilities and industry expertise give
it the ability to address changes in the client’s industry demand and help them
compete in markets where data is the new natural resource.
 
       Integrated Technology Services (ITS) revenue of
$2,225 million decreased 5.7 percent as reported, but grew 4 percent adjusted
for currency in the third quarter driven by cloud solutions. Within ITS,
SoftLayer revenue grew strong double digits at constant currency as the company
continues to increase its capacity. In September, the company’s second cloud
center in Brazil was opened offering a full range of SoftLayer infrastructure
services including bare metal and virtual servers, storage, security services
and networking. Recently, the company opened a cloud data center in India as it
continues to enable local companies to build in-country cloud solutions, and
the company is partnering with NASSCOM to create a platform for thousands of
startups.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       Maintenance revenue of
$1,516 million decreased 13.0 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent in the
third quarter adjusted for currency (10 points) and the System x divestiture (4
points). There was continued strength in third party hardware maintenance
offerings, which allow clients to leverage the company’s global reach and
inventory capabilities.   
 
       Global
Business Services revenue of $4,206 million decreased 13.1 percent as reported
and 5 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2015 compared to
the prior year. GBS revenue decreased 12.7 percent as reported and 4 percent
adjusted for currency (9 points) and divestitures in the first nine months of
the year. In the third quarter, GBS Outsourcing revenue of $1,219 million
decreased 8.0 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency
with growth in both process outsourcing and application outsourcing. This
growth was more than offset by a decline in Consulting and Systems Integration
(C&SI) revenue. In the third quarter, C&SI revenue of $2,984 million
declined 15.1 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency. In the
enterprise application space, the company continues to see a shift away from
traditional ERP implementation projects to smaller initiatives that are built
around cloud, mobility, security and analytics. While there is continued growth
in these high value services, performance is still being impacted by larger
contracts that are reaching their maturity. The decline in C&SI reflects
this shift in market demand.  
 
       Within
GBS, there was strong double digit revenue growth adjusting for currency in the
strategic imperatives. At constant currency, cloud and analytics services were
both up double digits in the quarter and the mobile practice grew nearly five
times. Recently, the company launched the industry’s first consulting practice
dedicated to helping clients realize the transformative value of cognitive
business. The new practice draws on the expertise of more than two thousand
consulting professionals who will help clients leverage cognitive computing to
unlock new possibilities for their business. To further add to GBS
capabilities, at the end of September, the company announced plans to acquire
Meteorix, a leading Workday services provider. This will expand the company’s
reach as Meteorix has cultivated deep expertise and best practices for
maximizing returns from these cloud-based human resource applications.

       The GTS gross profit margin decreased 1.0 points and
1.6 points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively,
compared to prior year. In the third quarter, pre-tax income decreased 21.6
percent to $1,274 million. While the GTS pre-tax margin improved quarter to
quarter, it declined 2.2 points to 15.7 percent compared to the prior year
largely reflecting the investments being made in this business. The company
continues to invest to deliver the most contemporary offerings that are built
with cloud, analytics, mobile, security and cognitive technologies enabling it
to transform clients’ enterprises. The company also continues to invest to
expand its global delivery capability and increase its delivery efficiency
through automation. The company continues to rebalance its workforce and took a
charge in the third quarter, essentially all of which was a year-to-year impact
on profit. In addition, currency remains the largest year-to-year impact on
profit growth given the strong dollar currency environment. 
 
  The GBS gross profit margin decreased 1.3 points and 1.8
points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively,
compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, pre-tax income decreased 21.8
percent to $673 million and pre-tax margin declined 1.7 points to 15.6 percent
compared to the prior year. This year to year profit decline reflects the
market shifts in the GBS business. In parts of the portfolio where the market
is declining, there is price and profit pressure. The company continues to
shift away from these areas into high value services around cloud and
engagement, but needs to move faster. In addition, workforce rebalancing
charges are up modestly year to year as the company continues to remix skills
to the strategic imperatives. The company also remains focused on cost
competitiveness through alternate labor models and enhancing its global
delivery capabilities.
 
  Within Global Services, the company has built
capabilities to deliver the most contemporary offerings to its clients to
transform their operations and help them become data-driven enterprises. This
can be seen in the consistent revenue growth, on an adjusted basis, within GTS
and in the total services backlog which, at constant currency, grew again this
quarter.         
 
Global
Services Backlog
 
      
The estimated Global
Services backlog at September 30, 2015 was $118 billion, a decrease of 7.7
percent as reported, but an increase of 1 percent adjusted for currency
compared to the September 30, 2014 balance. The estimated transactional backlog at September 30, 2015
decreased 9.5 percent and 2 percent adjusted for currency from the September
30, 2014 levels. The estimated outsourcing backlog decreased 5.9 percent as
reported, but grew 4 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.

        Total Global Services backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS,
GBS Outsourcing, Consulting and Systems Integration and Maintenance.
Outsourcing backlog includes GTS Outsourcing and GBS Outsourcing. Transactional
backlog includes ITS and Consulting and Systems Integration. Total backlog is
intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and therefore does
include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected
by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts,
periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and
adjustments for currency.
 
Global Services signings are management’s
initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a Global Services
contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the
calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates
and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type
and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or
wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS
Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems Integration
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in
signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues
equal renewals.
 
Contract portfolios purchased in an
acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those
contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing
will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or
coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

        Software revenue of $5,136 million
decreased 10.0 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for
currency in the third quarter, which is in line with the revenue trajectory
seen over the past year. In the third quarter, year-to-year software revenue performance
reflected a continuing headwind from operating systems, a decline in other
middleware and a decrease of 1 percent at constant currency in key branded
middleware which accounts for about two-thirds of the total revenue. Operating
systems decreased 13.8 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency,
and other middleware

decreased 14.6 percent as
reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency. For the first nine months of the
year, software revenue of $16,165 million decreased 9.5 percent as reported and
3 percent adjusted for currency. 
 
       Key branded middleware revenue of
$3,418 million, which accounted for 67 percent of total software revenue in the
third quarter, decreased 7.5 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for
currency compared to the prior year period. While Websphere and Information
Management grew year to year on an adjusted basis, the growth was more than offset
by decreases across the other brands. For the first nine months of 2015, key
branded middleware revenue of $10,920 million decreased 6.5 percent as reported
and was flat adjusted for currency.
 
       Large clients continue to utilize
the flexibility provided in deployment of their software as they build out
their environments. This is reflected in the revenue performance of key branded
middleware, with growth in annuity revenue, offset by declines in transactional
revenue. While the software revenue trajectory did not change from the second
to the third quarter, there was a slowdown in the transactional revenue at the
end of the quarter, predominately in the U.S. Overall, in the third quarter, there
was again growth across the solution areas, including security, analytics and
social, and within that there was strong growth in the Software-as-a-Service
offerings. Security software grew at a double-digit rate at constant currency.
The company’s security solutions are built on a platform of intelligence,
integration and expertise which, in the world of connected devices and an era
of hybrid cloud, is a key differentiation that the company brings to the
marketplace. These solutions are based on platforms, leveraging hybrid
environments with an industry dimension. Customers are taking advantage of the
company’s hybrid capabilities, connecting new cloud and mobile applications to
their existing IT infrastructures. This year the company has added more than
one thousand new customers to its systems middleware, like Websphere, which is
a reflection of the continued need for clients to support hybrid IT
environments.

* Adjusted for the System x divestiture and currency. 


 



 
       In the third quarter of 2015,
Systems Hardware revenue of $1,492 million decreased 38.7 percent as reported
and 2 percent year to year adjusted for the divestiture of the System x
business (34 points) and currency (3 points). There was continued strong
performance in z Systems, and Power Systems grew, on an adjusted basis, as the
company captures both the UNIX and Linux opportunity, but this was offset by
declines in Storage, which continues to be a challenging market. For the first
nine months of the year, revenue of $5,209 million decreased 31.4 percent as
reported, but grew 10 percent adjusted for the divestiture of the System x
business (37 points) and currency (4 points) driven by strong growth in z
Systems of 42 percent at constant currency. 
 
       In the third quarter, z Systems
revenue increased 15.0 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for
currency, and in the first nine months of the year, revenue grew 34.3 percent
as reported and 42 percent at constant currency. MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) shipments increased 18 percent and 36 percent in the third quarter
and the first nine months of the year, respectively. Building on the success of
Linux on z Systems, in the third quarter the company introduced the LinuxOne
family of products which embraces open-source based technologies and are the
industry’s most powerful and secure enterprise servers designed for the hybrid
cloud environment. These innovations continue to resonate with customers and
the company continues to add new customers to the platform across several
different industries and countries including Japan, Australia, Singapore,
Germany and the U.S. As the platform has been contemporized, many customers are
selecting Linux-based z Systems not only to consolidate existing systems to
Linux on the platform to drive operational efficiency, but also to leverage the
scalability and security that these systems offer.
 
       Power Systems revenue decreased 3.1
percent as reported, but grew 2 percent adjusted for currency in the third
quarter compared to the prior year. This is the third consecutive quarter of
constant currency growth in the platform and reflects the revenue performance
expected from Power in a product cycle year. For the first nine months of the
year, revenue decreased 2.3 percent as reported, but grew 3 percent adjusted
for currency. In the third quarter, there was growth in both entry-level and
the high-end systems, including strong growth and continued customer adoption
in Linux-based systems. The OpenPOWER initiative continues to progress, as the
company integrates innovation from the broader ecosystem into its own products
and licenses IP to support third-party Power-based offerings. The announcement
of the company’s LC (Linux Cluster) line of Power-based Linux servers is an
example of how the company is bringing innovation from OpenPOWER partnerships
to its own offerings. These Power results continue to reflect the progress
being made to transform the platform to align around data and cloud while
embracing an open ecosystem. 
 
       Storage revenue decreased 18.6
percent as reported and 14 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter
compared to the prior year, which more than offset growth in high-end servers
at constant currency. This decline was driven by continued weakness in high-end
disk and tape. As the market is shifting rapidly to flash, there was again
strong growth in the

company’s FlashSystems offerings.
For the first nine months of 2015, Storage revenue decreased 12.2 percent as
reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.

       The
Systems Hardware gross profit margin of 44.7 percent increased 10.8 points in
the third quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year. The increase was due to
mix (12.6 points) driven by the strong growth in z Systems and the divestiture
of the lower margin System x business. This improvement was offset by a
decrease due to margin (1.8 points), with lower margins in z Systems and Power
Systems. The Systems Hardware gross profit margin of 46.0 percent increased 9.8
points in the first nine months of 2015 versus the prior year. The increase was
due to mix (14.2 points) driven by the strong growth in z Systems and the
divestiture of the System x business. This improvement was offset by a decrease
due to margin with lower margins (4.4 points) in z Systems and Power Systems
compared to the prior year.
  
       Systems
Hardware had a pre-tax loss of $24 million in the third quarter of 2015
compared with a pre-tax loss of $99 million in the prior year.  For the first
nine months of 2015, pre-tax income was $255 million, an increase of $609
million compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin increased 2.3 points in the
third quarter and increased 9.0 points in the first nine months versus the
prior year periods. When setting out this year, the company saw leverage in the
business through the z Systems and Power platforms. These results confirm the
progress made in the first three quarters of 2015.

      The increase in income of $30 million year over
year in the third quarter was primarily driven by:


·       
Higher gains on derivative
instruments ($893 million); partially offset by  


·       
Higher foreign currency
transaction losses ($811 million). 


      
The increase in income of $145 million year over year in the first nine months was
primarily driven by:


·     
Increased gains on derivative
instruments ($1,223 million); partially offset by 


·     
Higher foreign currency
transaction losses ($828 million); and


·     
Lower gains on divestitures ($267
million) primarily associated with divestiture of the customer care business in
the prior year.

       The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2015 versus the same periods of 2014 was primarily driven by
lower average debt levels, partially
offset by higher average interest rates. Interest expense is presented in cost
of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related
external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business.
Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the third quarter
and first nine months of 2015 was $249 million and $747 million, respectively,
a decrease of $7 million and $27 million, respectively, versus the comparable
prior year periods.

        In the third
quarter of 2015, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $98
million compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily driven by an increase
in recognized actuarial losses ($200 million) and lower expected return on plan
assets ($120 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($171 million)
and lower defined contribution plan costs ($42 million). Total cost for the
first nine months of 2015 increased by $469 million versus the first nine
months of 2014, primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses
($591 million), lower expected return on plan assets ($378 million) and higher
pension obligations related to litigation in Spain ($155 million), partially
offset by lower interest cost ($524 million) and lower defined contribution
plan costs ($120 million).   
   
    As
discussed in the “Snapshot” on page 49, the company characterizes certain
retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing
this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the third quarter
of 2015 were $369 million, a decrease of $35 million compared to the third quarter
of 2014, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plans cost ($42
million). Non-operating costs of $204 million increased $132 million in the
third quarter of 2015 year to year, driven primarily by an increase in
recognized actuarial losses ($200 million) and lower expected return on plan
assets ($120 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($171 million).
For the first nine months of 2015, operating retirement-related costs were
$1,122 million, a decrease of $116 million compared to the first nine months of
2014, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plan costs ($120 million).
Non-operating costs of $831 million increased $585 million in the first nine
months of 2015 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in
recognized actuarial losses ($591 million), higher pension obligations related
to litigation in Spain ($155 million) and lower expected return on plan assets
($378 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($524 million).

Taxes
 
        The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter
of 2015 was 18.2 percent, a decrease of 2.6 points compared to the third
quarter of 2014. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first
nine months of 2015 was 17.9 percent, a decrease of 2.7 points compared to the
first nine months of 2014. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third
quarter of 2015 was 18.0 percent, a decrease of 2.8 points versus the third
quarter of 2014. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of
2015 was 18.3 percent, a decrease of 2.3 points versus the first nine months of
2014. 
 
       The decrease in the third quarter rate
was primarily driven by a discrete period benefit resulting from an increase in
the utilization of prior year foreign tax credits (10.4 points), net year to
year discrete period benefits related to audit activity (0.9 points), as well
as a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income (1.0 points). These
benefits were partially offset by a tax charge related to certain intercompany
payments made by foreign subsidiaries and the tax costs associated with the
intercompany licensing of certain IP in the third quarter (9.7 points). The
decrease in the third quarter operating (non-GAAP) rate was primarily driven by
the same factors.  
 
       The decrease in the tax rate for the
first nine months was primarily driven by the third quarter discrete period
benefit resulting from the increase in the utilization of prior year foreign
tax credits (3.5 points), net discrete benefits related to audit activity (1.4
points), primarily occurring in the second quarter, as well as a more favorable
geographic mix of pre-tax income (1.0 points). These benefits were partially
offset by the third quarter tax charge related to certain intercompany payments
made by foreign subsidiaries and the tax costs associated with the intercompany
licensing of certain IP (3.3 points). The decrease in the operating (non-GAAP)
rate for the first nine months was primarily driven by the same factors. 
 
       With respect to major U.S. state and
foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax
examinations for years prior to 2009. The company is no longer subject to
income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2011.
The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the
amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
       The amount of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2014 increased by $39 million in the third quarter of 2015 and
increased by $99 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $5,203 million.
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
favorably affect the effective tax rate was $4,236 million at September 30,
2015.
 
       In April 2010, the company appealed the
determination of the Japanese Tax Authorities with respect to certain foreign
tax losses. The tax benefit of these losses, approximately $1,002 million
adjusted for currency, has been included in unrecognized tax benefits. In April
2011, the company received notification that the appeal was denied, and in June
2011, the company filed a lawsuit challenging this decision. In May 2014, the
Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of the company. The Japanese government
appealed the ruling to the Tokyo High Court. On March 25, 2015, the Tokyo High
Court ruled in favor of IBM and, on April 7, 2015, the Japanese government
appealed the ruling to the Japan Supreme Court. No final determination has been
reached on this matter.   
 
       In the fourth quarter of 2013, the
company received a draft tax assessment notice, currently valued at
approximately $817 million from the Indian Tax Authorities for 2009. The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a
meaningful indicator of liability. At September 30, 2015, the company has
recorded $490 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion
of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the
company’s right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the Indian Tax
Authorities.
 
      
In the first quarter of 2014, the IRS commenced its audit of the company’s U.S.
income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. The company anticipates that this audit
will be completed by the end of 2015.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 were 18.7 million and 28.9
million shares lower, respectively, than the same periods in 2014. The decrease
was primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program.
  
Results of
Discontinued Operations
       The loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was $12 million and $176 million in the third quarter
and first nine months, respectively, of 2015 compared to $3,437 million and
$3,698 million in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of
2014. The loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2014 included a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $4,697 million which
included an impairment to reflect the fair value less estimated costs to sell
the Microelectronics business and other estimated costs related to the
transaction, including cash consideration. The discontinued operations
effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2015 was 78.8 percent compared to
29.0 percent in the third quarter of 2014 and was 38.0 percent in the first
nine months of 2015 compared to 29.1 percent in the prior year period.  
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At September 30, 2015, the company continued to have
the financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $9,568 million. Total debt of $39,660 million decreased $1,144 million from prior
year-end levels, driven by maturities of $5,389 million, partially offset by
new debt issuances of $3,705 million and commercial paper of $950 million.
Within total debt, $25,969 million, or approximately 65 percent, is in support
of the Global Financing business. The company continues to manage the
investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and
liquidity objectives. In the first nine months of 2015, the company generated
$11,729 million in cash from operations, an increase of $920 million compared
to the first nine  months of 2014. The company
has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to
have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and
its $10 billion global credit facility. In
October 2015, the term of the five-year global credit facility was extended by
one year, and now expires on November 10, 2020. 
 
       The assets and debt associated with the Global
Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial
position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are
the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in
the separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 81, are supplementary
data presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.

       Working capital
decreased $1,442 million from the year-end 2014 position. The key changes are
described below:      
 
Current
assets decreased $7,310 million ($5,075  million adjusted for
currency), due to:
 
·        
A decline of $3,640 million
($2,548 million adjusted for currency) in financing
receivables primarily due to collections of higher year-end balances; and 
 
·        
A decline of $1,975
million ($1,922 million adjusted for currency) in other accounts receivable
primarily the result of the collection of tax refunds; and
 
·        
A decline of $1,103
million ($618 million adjusted for currency) in trade accounts receivable
driven by collections of higher year-end balances; and
 
·        
A decline of $809
million ($557 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other
current assets due to decreases in counterparty collateral postings and
derivative assets; and
 
·        
A decline of $491
million ($427 million adjusted for currency) in inventories primarily driven by the Microelectronics
divestiture; partially offset by
 
·        
An increase of $1,004 million
($1,197 million adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
       Current liabilities
decreased $5,868 million ($4,384 million adjusted for currency), as a result
of:
 
·        
A decrease
in taxes of $2,201 million ($2,003 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by income tax payments and a tax benefit
associated with the Microelectronics divestiture; and     
 
·        
A decrease in other
accrued expenses and liabilities of $2,111 million ($1,880 million adjusted for
currency) driven by the cash consideration associated with the Microelectronics
divestiture and by workforce rebalancing payments; and    
  
·        
A decrease in accounts payable of
$1,699 million ($1,481 million adjusted for currency)
reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances and the wind-down
of the divested System x business payables; and     
 
·        
A decrease in deferred
income of $1,419 million ($906 million adjusted for currency) driven by
amortization; partially offset by
 
·        
An increase in
short-term debt of $1,807 million ($1,930 million adjusted for currency)
primarily as a result of
reclassifications of $5,441 million from long term to reflect upcoming
maturities, commercial paper of $950 million and issuances of $782 million,
partially offset by maturities of $5,389 million.
 
Cash Flow
 
       The company’s cash flows from operating, investing
and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts
include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.

reflecting seasonal reductions from higher year-end balances; and
 
·        
A decrease of $1,118

       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate
long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset
portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 85.
 
       Non-Global Financing debt of $13,691 million was up
$1,989 million from December 31, 2014, but decreased $3,361 million from the
third quarter of 2014. 
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
       “Core”
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
58.4 percent at September 30, 2015 compared to 59.4 percent at December 31,
2014 and 61.9 percent at September 30, 2014. 
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization
ratio at September 30, 2015 was 74.7 percent versus 77.3 percent at December
31, 2014 and 76.0 percent at September 30, 2014.   
 
Equity
 
       Total equity increased by $1,437 million from
December 31, 2014 as a result of an increase in retained earnings of $5,105
million, an increase in retirement-related pension amounts of $1,608 million
and an increase in common stock of $554 million, partially offset by an
increase in treasury stock of $3,954 million primarily due to common stock
repurchases and declines of $1,593 million related to currency translation.

Looking
Forward 
 
       The company measures the success of its business
model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The company’s
strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective of
optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the
company is well-positioned to take advantage of major shifts occurring in
technology, business and the global economy.
 
       Within the IT industry, there are major shifts
occurring—driven by data, cloud and changes in the ways individuals and
enterprises are engaging. In February 2015, the company met with investors to
discuss how it is transforming the business to where the company sees the long
term value in enterprise IT. The company’s strategic direction is clear and
compelling, and the company has been successful in shifting to the higher value
areas. The strong revenue growth in the strategic imperatives confirms that, as
does the overall profitability of the business. The company expects the
industry to continue to shift. The company expects revenue from its strategic
imperatives to continue to grow at a double-digit rate. These offerings are as
high value as other parts of the business, which continue to manage clients’
most critical business processes. As the cloud business gets to scale, and with
ongoing productivity improvements across the business, the company expects to
have an opportunity to expand margin. In addition, the company expects to
continue to allocate its capital efficiently and effectively to investments, and
to return value to its shareholders through a combination of dividends and
share repurchases. Over the longer term, in considering the opportunities it
will continue to develop, the company expects to have the ability to generate
low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher value business mix, high
single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash
flow realization in the 90’s percent range. This is a longer term growth
trajectory, not an absolute end point or a multi-year objective.
 
       In the first nine months of 2015, the company’s
results reflect the progress that it is making in the transformation. The
company continues to move aggressively and decisively to reshape the business
to best address the long-term value in enterprise IT. The company continued to
shift investments and resources, establish new partnerships and ecosystems and
introduce new innovations to the marketplace, including the launch of the
industry’s first consulting practice dedicated to cognitive business. Each
action that the company takes contributes to its transformation and improves
the business for the long term. In the first nine months, total revenue
declined less than 1 percent year to year, adjusted for currency and the impact
of divested businesses. Revenue from the strategic imperatives grew more than
30 percent adjusted for currency and divestitures. There was significant
strength in high-end systems, as the company’s new products address the most
contemporary workloads in data, cloud and mobile. This strength, together with
the overall shift to higher value and the company’s portfolio actions, drove
margin expansion on the fairly stable revenue base. The company has maintained
a high level of investment, as it shifts its spending to the strategic
imperatives. The company has realized returns on these investments, as
demonstrated by the strategic imperatives revenue growth. At the same time, the
core is declining, in a declining market, as the company delivers productivity
to its clients so that they can invest in the new areas. The company has stated
that this transformation takes time, and its progression would not be a
straight line. However, execution over this sustained period is a proof point
that the company is on the right path.  
   
       The company has made significant progress in driving
the transformation of the business. However, the Global Business Services
transformation is taking longer, which is putting some pressure on the
company’s revenue and profit. In addition, the company had weaker transaction
performance at the end of the third quarter, which when applied to the larger
transaction base in the fourth quarter, has a more significant impact. At the
same time, the company will continue to invest into the strategic imperatives
where it sees tremendous opportunity – to accelerate this transformation.
Taking all of this into consideration, in October 2015, the company updated its
expectations for the full year 2015 for GAAP earnings per share from continuing
operations to be in the range of $13.25 to $14.25, and operating (non-GAAP)
earnings per share to be in the range of $14.75 to $15.75. Putting the low end
of the operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share range into perspective, the
$14.75 not only reflects the transaction trajectory at the end of the third
quarter, but is also in line with a typical third to fourth quarter skew. The
change in profit expectations has less impact on free cash flow for the year,
as most of the transactions would occur late in the quarter. Therefore, the
company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately flat versus the
prior year.  Going forward, the company expects to continue strong growth in
its strategic imperatives, and it expects to continue to invest at a high level
to drive the transformation, while returning value to shareholders.
Importantly, the company is continuing to manage the business for the long
term.  
 
       In the present currency environment, and considering
the impact from the completed divestitures, total revenue as reported is
expected to decline in 2015. At October 2015 spot rates, the company expects
the negative impact from currency on revenue to be approximately 5 points in
the fourth quarter and approximately 7-8 points for the full year. The impact
of divested businesses has no impact in the fourth quarter and is 3 points for
the full year 2015. Therefore, the combined negative
impact of currency at these spot rates and the divested businesses is expected
to be approximately 5 points in the 

77



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

fourth quarter and
10-11 points for the full year. Also, as with all companies with a
similar global business profile, with the dollar strengthening, the company
expects currency will have a significant translation impact on its profit
growth. The estimated impact to operating (non-GAAP) earnings growth in the
first nine months of 2015 was approximately $0.56 per share. Based on
year-to-date performance and October 2015 spot rates, the company now expects
currency to impact operating (non-GAAP) earnings year-to-year growth by more
than $0.80 per share for the full year. 
 
       Within the company’s earnings per share expectation
for 2015, with the flow through from the prior year share reduction, the first
nine months repurchase amount and the remaining authorization, the company is
expecting a 2-3 point benefit from share repurchases—less than the benefit in
2014. At the end of September 2015, the company had approximately $2.4 billion
of repurchase authorization remaining.  
 
  The company expects, in the normal course
of business, that its effective tax rate and operating (non-GAAP) tax rate will
be approximately 20 percent. The tax rate in the first nine months of 2015
reflected a benefit from certain discrete items. The rate will change year to
year based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits
and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic
mix of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend
repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income
tax strategies.
 
       The company expects 2015 pre-tax retirement-related
plan cost to be approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of approximately $600
million compared to 2014. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions
at December 31, 2014. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating
retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, a
decrease of approximately $100 million versus 2014. Non-operating
retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, an
increase of approximately $700 million compared to 2014, driven by increased
recognized actuarial losses and the additional Spain pension-related
obligation. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be
approximately $2.6 billion in 2015, essentially flat compared to 2014.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar (USD) affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At September 30, 2015, currency changes resulted in assets
and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars
than at year-end 2014. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit
specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. 
 
      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this
information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could
take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the
company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first nine
months of 2015. Based on the currency rate movements in the first nine months
of 2015, total revenue decreased 13.1 percent as reported and decreased 4.8
percent at constant currency versus the first nine months of 2014. On an income
from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts
offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical
maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) decrease of approximately $700
million in the first nine months of 2015 on an as reported basis, and a
decrease of approximately $900 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The
same mathematical exercise resulted in a decrease of approximately $75 million
in the first nine months of 2014 on both an as reported and operating
(non-GAAP) basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum
impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational
responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and
timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency
impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be
substantially less than the theoretical maximum
given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches
that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly
inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking
prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
        The company continues to monitor the
economic conditions in Venezuela. In March 2013, the Venezuelan government
created a new foreign exchange mechanism called the “Complimentary System of
Foreign Currency Acquirement” (or the “SICAD 1”). This system operates similar
to an auction system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S.
dollars to be used for specific import transactions. In March 2014, the company
adopted the SICAD 1 rate of 10.7 Bolivar (Bs) per USD. In the first quarter of
2014, the company recorded a pre-tax loss of $31 million as a result of the
devaluation in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government created a new foreign
exchange platform, the Marginal Currency System, or SIMADI.  The company will
continue to monitor transactions from these exchange systems going-forward in
2015. At the September 30, 2015 SICAD rate of 13.5 Bs/USD, the company’s net asset
position in Venezuela was $33 million, reflecting a $2 million currency loss
recorded in the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2015, the company
has recorded $4 million in currency losses. The company’s operations in
Venezuela comprised less than 1 percent of total 2014 and 2013 revenue,
respectively.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2014 Annual Report, on pages 65 to 68,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 65 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
nine months ended, or as of, as applicable, September 30, 2015, those amounts
are $11.7 billion for net cash from operating activities, $9.6 billion of cash
and marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. In October 2015, the
term of the five-year global credit facility was extended by one year, and now
expires on November 10, 2020.   
 
      The major rating agencies’ ratings
on the company’s debt securities at September 30, 2015 appear in the table below.
The agency ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2014. Standard and
Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings reaffirmed their credit
ratings on April 21, 2015, March 30, 2015 and June 24, 2015, respectively. The
company does not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or
documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and
seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit
rating. The company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments
contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the
agreement if the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade.
At September 30, 2015, the fair value of those instruments that were in a
liability position was $230 million, before any applicable netting, and this
position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the
level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. The
company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in
credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial
position or liquidity.

      The table appearing on page 66 of the company’s
2014 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash flows
for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of the way
cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. The company prepares its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting
standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and
highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format
on page 75. The following is management’s view of cash flows for the first nine
months of 2015 and 2014 prepared in a manner consistent with the table and

        Free
cash flow of $7,003 million for the first nine months of 2015 increased $1,220
million year to year. The increase was driven primarily by a reduction in cash
tax payments of $2.8 billion compared to the first nine months of 2014 and
continued improvement in sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset
by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from the System x
divestiture ($0.2 billion), a higher level of payments for performance-based
compensation ($0.5 billion) which was accrued for in 2014 and performance-related
declines in net income. Net capital expenditures of $2.8 billion was
essentially flat year to year, although spending included a shift as the
company continues to build out its cloud capacity. In the first nine months of
2015, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to
shareholders including $3.6 billion in dividends and $3.8 billion in gross
common stock repurchases. 
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2014 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe
downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in note 12, “Contingencies,” in this
Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $600 million in 2015. Contributions related to all
retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2015.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum
contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent
remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.  
 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity
options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional
funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit
facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany
loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.  
 
        The company does earn a significant amount
of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The company’s policy is to indefinitely
reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and
accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a
portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional
U.S. tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any,
associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the
company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign
subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for operations and obligations in the
U.S., the company could elect to repatriate these funds which could result in a
reassessment of the company’s policy and increased tax expense.

       The decrease in
revenue in the third quarter, as compared to the same period in 2014, was due
to:
 
·        
A decline in external revenue of
8.1 percent as reported, but an increase of 7 percent adjusted for currency,
due to decreases in financing revenue (down 8.0 percent to $347 million) and equipment
sales revenue (down 9.2 percent to $99 million); and 
 
·        
A decline in internal revenue of
2.3 percent, due to a decrease in financing revenue (down 20.7 percent to $84
million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales revenue (up
1.7 percent to $500 million).
 
       The decrease in
revenue in the first nine months, as compared to the same period in 2014, was
due to:
 
·        
A decline in external revenue of
7.7 percent as reported, but an increase of 4 percent adjusted for currency,
due to decreases in financing revenue (down 8.6 percent to $1,061 million) and equipment
sales revenue (down 5.3 percent to $322 million); and
 
·        
A decline in internal revenue of
1.4 percent, due to a decrease in financing revenue (down 19.3 percent to $254
million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales revenue (up
2.2 percent to $1,621 million).
 
       The decreases in
external financing revenue in the third quarter and for the first nine months
of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, were due to a decrease in the
average asset balance. The decreases in internal financing revenue in the third
quarter and for the first nine months of 2015, compared to the same periods in
2014, were due to a decrease in the average asset balance as well as lower
asset yields.
        
       Global Financing gross
profit decreased 0.3 percent and 5.4 percent in the third quarter and in the
first nine months respectively, of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014,
due to a decrease in financing gross profit, partially offset by an increase in
used equipment sales gross profit. The gross profit margin increased 3.2 points
in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due to an
increase in the used equipment sales margin.  The gross profit margin decreased
0.9 points in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the same period in
2014, due to a decrease in the financing margin.
 
       Global Financing
pre-tax income increased 18.1 percent to $562 million in the third quarter of
2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due to decreases in financing
receivables provisions ($52 million) and in selling, general and administrative
expenses ($36 million), partially offset by the decrease in gross profit ($2
million). Pre-tax income increased 1.6 percent to $1,690 million in the first

selling, general and administrative expenses ($96 million)
and in financing receivables provisions ($56 million), partially offset by the
decrease in gross profit ($126 million). The decreases in financing receivables
provisions for both periods were due to lower specific reserve requirements in
the current year.
 
      The increase in return
on equity in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the same period of 2014,
was due to the increase in after-tax income and a lower average equity balance.
The increase in return on equity for the first nine months of 2015, compared to
the same period of 2014, was due to a lower average equity balance.

Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist of IBM systems, software and services, and OEM equipment,
software and services to meet IBM clients’ total solutions requirements. Client
financing assets are primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating
leases for systems products, as well as loans for systems, software and
services, with terms up to seven years. Global Financing’s client loans are
primarily for software and services and are unsecured. These loans are
subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed
necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks in the loan agreements which
include covenants to protect against credit deterioration during the life of
the obligation. 
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
        In addition to the actions previously described, in
certain circumstances, the company may take mitigation actions to transfer
credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees,
non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in
accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease.

       At September 30, 2015, substantially all financing
assets were IT related assets, and approximately 55 percent of the total
external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to
consumers.

financing and client financing assets exceeded new financing originations in
the third quarter of 2015 which resulted in a net decline in financing assets
in this period. The decrease in originations in both periods was due to a
decrease in volumes in commercial financing compared to the same period in the
prior year.

       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.9 percent at December 31, 2014, to 2.4 percent at
September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in specific reserve
requirements. Specific reserves increased 9 percent from $484 million at
December 31, 2014, to $527 million at September 30, 2015. Unallocated reserves
decreased 15 percent from $96 million at December 31, 2014, to $81 million
at September 30, 2015, primarily due to the decline in gross financing
receivables.   
 
       Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $14 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, compared to $66 million for the same period in 2014. Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $108 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, compared to $164 million for the same period in 2014. The
year-to-year decreases in bad debt expense were due to lower specific reserve
requirements, primarily in China, in the current year.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

Residual Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from lease returns,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned off of a lease,
surplus internal equipment, or used equipment purchased externally. These sales
represented 58.2 percent and 59.7 percent of Global Financing's revenue in the
third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2015, and 55.5 percent
and 56.6 percent in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of
2014. The increases in both periods were due to a higher volume of used
equipment sales for internal transactions. The gross profit margins on total
equipment sales were 65.6 percent and 60.0 percent in the third quarter of 2015
and 2014, respectively. The gross profit margins were 65.5 percent and 65.2
percent in the first nine months of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase
in the gross profit margin for the third quarter ending September 30, 2015 was
primarily driven by margin increases in both external and internal equipment
sales, as well as a shift in mix toward higher margin internal
equipment sales.
 
       The
table below presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2015 and
September 30, 2015. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a
percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of when the
unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30,
2015 is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of
the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While
primarily focused on IBM products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM
products. These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments
as provided for by accounting standards in the determination of lease
classifications for the covered equipment and provide protection against risk
of loss arising from declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease
payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a
sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate
asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $105
million and $103 million for the financing transactions originated during
the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and $565 million
and $306 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of direct financing
leases were $44 million and $52 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively,
and $141 million and $154 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
and 2014, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the
scheduled end of lease were $6 million for the financing transactions
originated in both of the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and $39
million and $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.6 million for both of the quarters
ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and $3.9 million and $1.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

        The company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio of 7 to 1. The debt
used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and
external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client
and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents,
the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany
investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company
to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing
receivable and are based on arm's-length pricing.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s
external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing
Results of Operations” on page 81 and in “Segment Information” on pages 28 and
29.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of Global Services’ long-term
contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these assets should
be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business
model.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
Looking
Forward
 
       Global Financing's financial position provides
flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to be well
positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s assets and new
financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed to the
company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets
are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term
commercial paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A
protracted period where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely
lead to a slowdown in originations.  
 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As previously discussed, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global Financing has policies in
place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies,
combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent
management of the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty
with respect to the global economy.
