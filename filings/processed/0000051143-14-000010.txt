Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The
financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the
company's management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
      
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake
in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be
different from these estimates. Refer to the company's 2013 Annual Report on
pages 67 to 70 for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
     
 On October 20, 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business and manufacturing
operations to GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The Microelectronics business was part of the
Systems and Technology reportable segment. In the third quarter of 2014, the
company recorded a pre-tax charge reflecting the fair value less estimated
costs to sell the Microelectronics business, which included an impairment of
the semiconductor-related long-lived assets, cash consideration and related
disposal costs. The assets and liabilities of the Microelectronics business are
reported as held for sale at September 30, 2014. The operating results of the
Microelectronics business, including the noted charge, have been reported as
discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to
this presentation to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing
operations. Refer to Note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional
information on the transaction.
 
      
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full
year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the company's 2013 Annual Report.
 
     
 Noncontrolling interest amounts in income of $2.4 million and $1.8 million, net of tax, for
the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $4.2 million and $4.2 million, net of tax, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are included in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense
line item.
 
      
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows
may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages
presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. This is annotated where applicable.
  

 
2. Accounting Changes:  In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on the recognition of revenue
from contracts with customers. Revenue recognition will depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively
to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the
cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of
initial application. The guidance is effective January 1, 2017 and early
adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact of
the new guidance and the method of adoption in the consolidated financial
results.
       In April 2014, the FASB
issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting a discontinued
operation. Only disposals of a component that represents a strategic shift that
has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial
results is a discontinued operation. The guidance also requires expanded
disclosures about discontinued operations and disposals of a significant part
of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The
guidance is effective January 1, 2015 with early adoption permitted, but only
for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported
in previously-issued financial statements. The company will adopt the new
guidance on January 1, 2015.The impact to the company will be dependent on any
transaction that is within the scope of the new guidance.
       In July 2013, the FASB
issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when
a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit
carryforward exists. Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits
should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred
tax asset for a net operating loss 

9



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

carryforward, a
similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The guidance was effective
January 1, 2014. The guidance was a change in financial statement
presentation only and did not have a material impact in the consolidated
financial results. 
  In March 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on when foreign currency translation adjustments should be
released to net income. When a parent entity ceases to have a controlling
financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within
a foreign entity, the parent is required to release any related cumulative
translation adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation
adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer
results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign
entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2014 and did not have a material impact in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.  
     In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of
the guidance is fixed at the reporting date. Examples include debt
arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation matters. The
guidance requires an entity to measure such obligations as the sum of the
amount that the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement
among its co-obligors plus additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay
on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance was effective January 1, 2014
and did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.
 
3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
       The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 

10



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

      
Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair
value at the measurement date to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
These assets include available-for-sale equity investments that are deemed to
be other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary
impairment of a financial investment, fair value is measured using a model
described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. See note A, “Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment,” on
page 88 in the company’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information. In
the third quarter of 2014, the company recorded an impairment on certain assets
that were reported as held for sale at September 30, 2014. See note 9,
“Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional information. There were no material
impairments of non-financial assets for the nine months ended September 30,
2013. 
 
       Accounting guidance
permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and
firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other
accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied
the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2014 and December
31, 2013.

 During the quarter ended
September 30, 2014, the company transferred trading securities investments valued
at $61 million from Level 2 to Level 1 due to the expiration of certain regulatory
restrictions. There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the year ended
December 31, 2013.
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
 
Notes and other accounts receivable and
other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate
fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt
(excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities
with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in
the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.   
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
       Fair values are based on discounted future cash
flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with
similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At September 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013, the difference 

13



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

between the
carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables
was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these
financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.
 
Long-term Debt
 
       Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is
based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an
asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market
price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates
currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term
debt was $32,821 million and $32,856 million, and the estimated
fair value was $35,165 million and $34,555 million at September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. If measured at fair value in the
financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be
classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities
are considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position. 
 
       During the first quarter of 2014, the company
acquired equity investments in conjunction with the sale of the customer care
business which are classified as trading securities. Unrealized losses related
to trading securities of $8 million and unrealized
gains of $8 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2014 and nine months ended September 30, 2014,
respectively, were recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.
 
       The following tables summarize the company’s
noncurrent debt and marketable equity securities which are considered
available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

     The contractual
maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less
than one year at September 30, 2014.
 
Derivative
Financial Instruments 
 
       The
company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender
and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the
company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and
client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and,
where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are
denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align
rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease
and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing
debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a
liability position at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $14 million
and $216 million, respectively, for which no collateral was posted at September
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  Full collateralization of these agreements
would be required in the event that the company’s credit rating falls below
investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points,
as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements.
The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in net asset positions as of
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $1,153 million and $719 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This
exposure was reduced by $128 million and $251 million at September 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting 

15



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, this exposure was reduced by $210
million and $29 million of cash collateral, respectively, received by the
company. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the net exposure related
to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position was $811 million and $439 million, respectively.  At September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, the net exposure related to derivative liabilities
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $194 million
and $250 million, respectively.  
 
       In the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset
derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does
it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash
collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. No
amount was recognized in other receivables at September 30, 2014 or December
31, 2013 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in
accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral totaled $210
million and $29 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013,
respectively. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to
rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was
rehypothecated at September 30, 2014 or at December 31, 2013. At September 30,
2014, the company held $3 million in non-cash collateral in U.S. Treasury
securities, and at December 31, 2013, no amounts of non-cash collateral were
held.    
 
       The
company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in
stockholders’ equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of
significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S.
dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the
company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact
upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the
underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an
ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by
de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the
liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may
utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the
de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts,
interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the
underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative
instruments.
 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk,
follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The
company issues debt in the global capital markets, principally to fund its
financing lease and loan portfolios. Access to cost-effective financing can
result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these
mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate
swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt
(i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances
into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At September 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of the company’s interest rate
swaps was $5.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The weighted-average
remaining maturity of these instruments at September 30, 2014 and December 31,
2013 was approximately 9.0 years and 10.6 years, respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The
company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To
manage this risk, the company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to
lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt
issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did
not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
       At
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, net gains of approximately $1 million
(before taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings.
Within these amounts, gains of less than $1 million, respectively, are expected
to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying transactions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

Foreign Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large
portion of the company’s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is
designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the
volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with
respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and
foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $3.1 billion and
$3.0 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these
instruments at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was approximately 0.2 years
and 0.4 years, respectively.
 
Anticipated
Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The
company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party
vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services
among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In
anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility
of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange
forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the
company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four
years. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount
of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and
cost transactions was $9.7 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, with a
weighted-average remaining maturity of 0.6 years and 0.7 years, respectively.
 
       At
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, in connection with cash flow hedges
of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains
of $428 million and net losses of $252 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $410
million of gains and $166 million of losses, respectively, are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 
 
Foreign
Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
       The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert
fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in
the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has
hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately
seven years. At December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of cross currency
swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was
$1.2 billion. At September 30, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under this
program.
 
       At
September 30, 2014 and  December 31, 2013, in connection with cash flow hedges
of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of
$2 million (before taxes) and $9 million (before taxes) in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss), respectively. Within these amounts, less than $1
million and $3 million of losses, respectively,  is expected to be reclassified
to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic
impact against the underlying exposure.           
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The
company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its
subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash
flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange
forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency
exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets and
liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less
than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the
underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other
(income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At September
30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $16.1 billion
and $14.7 billion, respectively. 
 
 
 
 

17



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

Equity Risk Management
 
       The
company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and
in the company’s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to
employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation
obligations are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and
futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee
compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on
certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock,
and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At September 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.3 billion for both
periods.
 
Other Risks
 
       The company
may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various
investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net
cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair value
of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement
of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as derivatives

Net investment in sales-type and
direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$689 million and $737 million at September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned
income of $560 million and $672 million, and net of the
allowance for credit losses of $161 million and $123 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses of $16 million and $23 million at September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and
accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM
products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing
generally range from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), net of the allowance
for credit losses of $343 million and $242 million at September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily
to clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment
terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables financing contracts are priced
independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $685 million and $769 million at September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing
receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at September
30, 2014 and December 31,
2013. The company determines
its allowance for credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease
receivables and loan receivables, and further segments the portfolio into two
classes: major markets and growth markets. For additional information on the
company’s accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, refer to the
company’s 2013 Annual Report on pages 92 and 93.

       When
determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an
individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the
company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an
estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts
in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. In
addition, the company records an unallocated reserve that is determined by
applying a reserve rate to its different portfolios, excluding accounts that
have been specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history. 
 
Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
       Certain receivables for which the company has recorded a
specific reserve may also be placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual assets
are those receivables with specific reserves and other accounts for  which it is likely
that the company will 

23



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

be unable to collect all amounts
due according to original terms of the lease or loan agreement. Income
recognition is discontinued on these receivables. 
 
       The following table presents the recorded investment in
financing receivables which were on non-accrual status at September 30, 2014
and December 31, 2013.

Impaired Loans

reserve as an impaired loan. Depending on the level of impairment, loans will
also be placed on non-accrual status.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating
agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers,
are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting
indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information
provided by Standard & Poor’s, where available, as one of many inputs in
its determination of customer credit ratings.
 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from AAA to BBB- are
considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade.
The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation actions that the
company may take to transfer credit risk to third parties.

        Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost
for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was flat compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in the pre-tax stock-based
compensation cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, as compared to
the corresponding period in the prior year, was due to decreases related to
restricted stock units ($21 million), performance
share units ($4 million) and the company’s
assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($13 million).
 
       The amount of
stock-based compensation cost included in the loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax was immaterial.
 
       As of
September 30, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,057 million related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.5 years.
 
       There was no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at September 30, 2014 and
2013.
 
6. Segments:  
The tables on pages 28 and 29 reflect the results of operations of the
company’s segments consistent with the management and measurement system
utilized within the company. Performance measurement is based on pre-tax income
from continuing operations. These results are used, in part, by senior
management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources
to, each of the segments.

       On March 24, 2014, the Supreme Court
of Spain issued a ruling against IBM Spain in litigation involving its defined
benefit and defined contribution plans. See page 45 for additional information.
As a result of the ruling, the company recorded an additional pre-tax
retirement-related obligation of $55 million in the first
quarter of 2014 in selling, general and administrative expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This charge was not reflected in operating
(non-GAAP) expense. This obligation is reflected in "Non-U.S. Plans -
Multi-employer plans/other costs" in the nine months table above. To date,
the rulings in this case are declaratory only.
 
       In March 2014, the company initiated a
change to the investment strategy of its U.S. defined benefit plan. The 2014
target asset allocation was modified, primarily by reducing equity securities
from 42 percent to 32 percent, and increasing debt securities from 47 percent
to 57 percent of total plan assets, respectively. The asset allocation change
was substantially completed by March 31, 2014. This change was designed to
reduce the potential negative impact that equity markets might have on the
funded status of the U.S. defined benefit plan. The change is expected to
reduce the 2015 expected long-term rate of return on assets to approximately 7.75
percent. See note S, "Retirement-Related Benefits," on page 135 in
the company's 2013 Annual Report for additional information regarding the
company's investment strategy.         
 
       In 2014, the company expects to contribute to its
non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans approximately $600 million, which will be
mainly contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in Japan, the UK,
Switzerland and the Netherlands. This amount represents the legally mandated
minimum contributions. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the
first nine months of 2014 were $387 million.

        In
connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (the ‘Act’), the company qualified to receive a subsidy through
2013. Due to benefit plan changes effective January 1, 2014, the company no
longer qualifies for the subsidy as of that date. The company may receive or
pay additional amounts after 2013 to true up the final subsidy amount due to
IBM under the Act. The company received a
$23.0 million subsidy for the
first nine months of 2014.  For further information related to the Act, refer to page 141
in the company’s 2013 Annual Report.         
 
9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
 
Acquisitions: During the nine months
ended September 30, 2014, the company completed six acquisitions at an
aggregate cost of $608 million.
   
The Software segment completed acquisitions of five
privately held companies: in the first quarter, Aspera, Inc. (Aspera) and
Cloudant, Inc. (Cloudant); in the second quarter, Silverpop Systems, Inc.
(Silverpop) and Cognea Group Pty LTD (Cognea); and in the third quarter,
CrossIdeas Srl.  Global Technology Services (GTS) completed one acquisition: in
the third quarter, Lighthouse Security Group, LLC (Lighthouse), a privately
held company. 
 
       The following table reflects the purchase price
related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price allocations as
of September 30, 2014:

Each acquisition
further complemented and enhanced the company’s portfolio of product and
services offerings.  Aspera’s technology makes cloud computing faster, more
predictable and more cost effective for big data transfers such as enterprise
storage, sharing virtual images or accessing the cloud for increased computing
capacity. Cloudant will extend the company’s mobile and cloud platform by
enabling developers to easily and quickly create next generation mobile and
web-based applications. Silverpop is a provider of cloud-based capabilities
that deliver personalized customer engagements in highly scalable environments.
Cognea offers personalized artificial intelligence capabilities designed to
serve as an intuitive interface between human users and data-driven
information. CrossIdeas delivers next generation identity and access governance
capabilities to help mitigate access risks and segregation of duty violations. 
Lighthouse is a provider of cloud-enabled managed identity and access management
solutions.  Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions as reflected in
the table above, is paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions are reported in
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash
equivalents.   
       The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity was recorded at
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired companies
and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify as an
amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life of the
identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 6.8 years. These
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Goodwill of $434 million has been assigned to the Software segment
and goodwill of $11 million has been assigned to the Global Technology Services
segment. It is expected that 1 percent of the goodwill will be deductible for
tax purposes. 
 
Divestitures: 
 
        Microelectronics
 
       On October 20, 2014, IBM
and GLOBALFOUNDRIES announced a definitive agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES
will acquire the company’s Microelectronics business, including existing
semiconductor manufacturing assets and operations in East Fishkill, NY and
Essex Junction, VT. The commercial OEM business to be acquired by
GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes custom logic and specialty foundry, manufacturing and
related operations.
 
       The companies have also agreed to a
ten year exclusive manufacturing sourcing agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES
will provide server processor semiconductor technology for use in IBM Systems.
The agreement provides the company with capacity and market-based pricing for
current semiconductor nodes in production and progression to nodes in the
future for both development and production needs. As part of the transaction
agreement, the company will provide GLOBALFOUNDRIES with certain transition
services, including I/T, supply chain, packaging and test services and lab
services. The initial term for these transition services is one to three years,
with GLOBALFOUNDRIES having the ability to renew. 
 
       The transaction will be completed as
soon as is practical, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements,
customary closing conditions and any other required approvals.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       In the third quarter, the company
recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.7 billion related to the sale of the
Microelectronics disposal group, which was part of the Systems and Technology reportable segment. The
pre-tax charge was recorded to reflect the fair value less the estimated cost
of selling the disposal group including an impairment to the semiconductor
long-lived assets of $2.4 billion, $1.5 billion representing the cash
consideration expected to be transferred to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and $0.8 billion of
other related costs. The asset impairment was reflected in property, plant and
equipment, net and the other costs of disposal were reflected in other accrued
expenses and liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position at September 30, 2014. These estimates may be adjusted, and
the company may incur additional charges prior to the closing of the
transaction. All assets and liabilities of the business are reported as held
for sale at September 30, 2014.The cash consideration is expected to be
transferred over three years with $750 million transferred at the closing date.
The actual net cash related to the transaction will be adjusted by the amount
of the working capital due from GLOBALFOUNDRIES, estimated to be $200 million.
  
      Reporting the related assets and
liabilities as held for sale at September 30, 2014 was based on meeting all of
the criteria for such reporting in the applicable accounting guidance. While
the company met certain criteria for held for sale reporting in prior periods,
it did not meet all of the criteria until September 30, 2014. In addition, at
September 30, 2014, the company concluded that the Microelectronics business
met the criteria for discontinued operations reporting. The disposal group
constitutes a component under accounting guidance. The continuing cash inflows
and outflows with the discontinued component are related to the manufacturing
sourcing arrangement and the transition, packaging and test services. These cash
flows are not direct cash flows as they are not significant and the company
will have no significant continuing involvement. 
 
      
Summarized financial information for discontinued operations is shown below.

Industry Standard
Server
On January 23, 2014, IBM and Lenovo Group Limited
(Lenovo) announced a definitive agreement in which Lenovo would acquire the
company’s industry standard server portfolio for an adjusted purchase price of
$2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $1.8 billion in cash, with the
balance in Lenovo common stock. The stock represented less than 5 percent
equity ownership in Lenovo. The company would sell to Lenovo its System x,
BladeCenter and Flex System blade servers and switches, x86-based Flex
integrated systems, NeXtScale and iDataPlex servers and associated software,
blade networking and maintenance operations.
       IBM and Lenovo have entered into a strategic
relationship which will include a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales
of IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems,
tape storage systems, General Parallel

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

File System
software, SmartCloud Entry offering, and elements of IBM’s system software,
including Systems Director and Platform Computing solutions. Effective with the
initial closing of the transaction, Lenovo has assumed related customer service
and maintenance operations. IBM
will continue to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s behalf for an
extended period of time. In addition, as part of the transaction agreement, the
company will provide Lenovo with certain transition services, including IT,
supply chain and warranty services. The initial term for these transition services
ranges from less than one year to three years. Lenovo can renew certain
services for an additional year.
 
   As of September
30, 2014, the company had received all regulatory approvals, and the activities
necessary to separate the tangible assets and prepare such assets for sale in
order to close the transaction were completed.
The transaction will be completed in phases, and the initial closing occurred
on October 1, 2014. The transaction is expected to close in most other
countries in which there is a larger business footprint in the fourth quarter
of 2014, with the remaining countries in early 2015.
 
  The company expects to recognize a total
pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.5 billion, which does not include associated costs related to transition
and performance-based costs. Net of these charges, the pre-tax gain is
approximately $1.0 billion, substantially all of which will be recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2014.  
 
  The company’s industry standard server
business is reported in the Systems
and Technology
segment, and the associated maintenance operations are part of the Global
Technology Services segment. In 2013, this combined business delivered
approximately $4.6 billion of revenue and was essentially breakeven on a
pre-tax income basis.
 
  As of September 30, 2014, the industry standard server business had $310 million of total assets and $468 million of total
liabilities which the company reported as held for sale on that date. The
classification of the related assets and liabilities as held for sale at
September 30, 2014 was based on meeting all of the criteria for such
classification in the applicable accounting guidance. While the company met
certain criteria for held for sale classification in prior periods, it did not meet
the criteria that the disposal group was available for immediate sale in its
present condition until September 30, 2014. Prior to that date, the company was
engaged in the regulatory review process and in the activities necessary to
separate the tangible assets and prepare such assets for sale. The assets held
for sale at September 30, 2014 were comprised of: property, plant and equipment
$131 million, inventory $133 million and intangible assets $47 million.
Liabilities were comprised of: deferred income $342 million and warranty $125
million. 
 
  In addition, at September 30, 2014, the
company concluded that the industry standard
server systems business did not meet the
criteria for discontinued operations reporting. The disposal group consists of
the industry standard server systems business and associated maintenance operations. The
industry standard server systems business constitutes a component under accounting
guidance, while the maintenance operations do not meet the definition of a
component. Due to the significance of the continuing cash flows with the
disposal group after the transaction closes, the company did not meet the
criteria to report the industry standard
server systems business as a discontinued
operation.
 
      Customer Care
  
       On September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a
definitive agreement in which SYNNEX would acquire the company’s worldwide
customer care business process outsourcing services business for $501 million,
consisting of approximately $430 million in cash, net of balance sheet
adjustments, and $71 million in SYNNEX common stock, which represented less
than 5 percent equity ownership in SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered
into a multi-year agreement with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s
outsourcing business, has become an IBM strategic business partner for global
customer care business process outsourcing services. 
 
        In the third
quarter 2014, the company completed the final wave of closings which resulted
in the transfer of the remaining customer care business assets to SYNNEX. A
nominal amount of expense was recorded during the quarter to record certain
transaction related expenses. Through the first nine months of 2014, the
company has recorded a pre-tax gain of $212 million related to this
transaction. The remaining financial impact associated with this transaction is
expected to occur in the fourth quarter 2014, pending determination of final balance
sheet adjustments.  
 
       Retail Store Solutions
 
       On April 17, 2012, the company
announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba TEC for the
sale of its Retail Store Solutions business. As part of the transaction, the
company agreed to transfer the maintenance business to Toshiba TEC within three
years of the original closing of the transaction.
 

39



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       In the third quarter of 2014, the
company completed the third phase of the transfer of the maintenance workforce
to Toshiba. Subsequent wave closings are scheduled to be completed through the
first quarter of 2015 along with associated parts and inventory transfer. The
third phase transfer and an assessment of the ongoing contractual terms of the
overall transaction resulted in the recognition of an additional pre-tax gain
of $6 million in the third quarter of 2014.
 
       The company expects to close the final
phase of the divestiture in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, the company
expects to recognize a cumulative total pre-tax gain on the sale of
approximately $508 million.
        
       Others 
 
       On
August 31, 2014, the company announced that it signed
a definitive agreement with UNICOM Systems Inc whereby UNICOM acquired a
non-strategic set of Cognos products. IBM acquired this product set
through the acquisition of Cognos in 2008. 
 
      On
September 30, 2014, the company announced that it signed a definitive agreement
with Rocket Software (Rocket) whereby Rocket acquired IMS Tools. IMS Tools was
developed in 2000 for database management, performance and recovery tooling.  
 
       On
September 30, 2014, the company announced that it signed a definitive agreement
with Kewill, whereby Kewill acquired the IBM Transportation Management System
(TMS). 
 
       On
September 30, 2014, the company announced that it signed a definitive agreement
with Rogue Wave Software (RW) whereby RW acquired the JViews Enterprise,
Elixir, and Visualization for .NET products.  
 
       All of
the above transactions closed in the third quarter of 2014 and the financial
terms related to these transactions were not material. Overall, the company
recorded a pre-tax gain of $78 million related to these transactions in the
third quarter of 2014.
 
       On June 30, 2014, the company completed the
divestiture of its Solid DB suite of products to UNICOM. Also on June 30, 2014,
the company completed the divestiture of its Human Capital Management business
line in France to Sopra Group. Financial details for both transactions were not
material.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

     The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$498 million during the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to
amortization, partially offset by intangible asset additions resulting from
acquisitions. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $339 million
and $1,018 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2014,
respectively, versus $350 million and $1,007 million for the third quarter and
first nine months of 2013, respectively. In addition, in the first nine months
of 2014, the company retired $474 million of fully amortized intangible assets,
impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this
amount.  
 
     The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following

         Note: The 2014-2015 maturities at 12/31/2013 includes $17 million of debt securities issued by IBM
International Group Capital, LLC, which is an indirect, 100 percent owned finance
subsidiary of the company which matured in the first half of 2014. Debt
securities issued by IBM International Group Capital LLC are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the company.  
*      The portion of the company’s
fixed-rate debt obligations that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position as an amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying value
plus a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the
hedged debt obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates.
 
       The company’s indenture governing its debt
securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants
which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the
aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10 percent of the company’s
consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge
or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also
include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio,
which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 
       The company is in compliance with all of its
significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders.
The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of
default with respect to the debt to which such 

42

Statements – (continued)

provisions
apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest
on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due
and payable.

13.  Contingencies:  As a company with a substantial employee
population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is involved, either
as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits,
investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information
technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to
claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings,
including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade
secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP
against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise.
Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and scale, the company is
party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide
range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested
employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the
company’s pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with
respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations,
competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a
number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former
employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives
of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to
which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues,
and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various
jurisdictions in which these matters arise.
 

43



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       The company records a provision
with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities
for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 were not material to the company’s
results of continuing operations and financial position.
 
       In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance,
the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of
material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also
discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative
factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and
investor, customer and employee relations considerations.
 
       With respect to certain of the claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the company believes at this
time that the likelihood of any material loss is remote, given, for example,
the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s
defenses in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings discussed in this Note, the company is unable to
provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including
losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims,
suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not
possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company’s
experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable
and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators
of the company’s potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide
such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims,
suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural
status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal
theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important
to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to
recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or
range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and
status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive
rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular
matter.
 
       Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally
determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably
have a material effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including:
the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any
such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or
remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique
facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to
additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself
vigorously, it is possible that the company’s business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period
by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
       The following is a summary of the more significant
legal matters involving the company.
 
       The company is a defendant in an action filed on
March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v.
IBM). The company removed the case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an
alleged successor in interest to some of AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges
copyright infringement, unfair competition, interference with contract and
breach of contract with regard to the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix
and contribution of code to Linux. The company has asserted counterclaims,
including breach of contract, violation of the Lanham Act, unfair competition,
intentional torts, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of the General
Public License that governs open source distributions, promissory estoppel and
copyright infringement. Motions for summary judgment were heard in March 2007,
and the court has not yet issued its decision. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff
filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed.
On August 25, 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware
approved the appointment of a Trustee of SCO. The court in another suit, the
SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010. The jury found
that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights; the judge
subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize Novell’s waiver of SCO’s
claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. On August
30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s
ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In June 2013, the Federal Court
in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v. IBM case.  On July 10, 2013, the Court entered an order dismissing 7
of SCO's 10 claims, specifically its breach of contract and copyright claims,
and one tortious interference claim.
 
       On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana
(acting on behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration)
sued one another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization
of social service program processing in Indiana. The State terminated the
contract, claiming that IBM was in breach, and the State is seeking damages.
IBM believes the State’s claims against it are without merit and is seeking payment
of termination amounts specified in the contract. After six weeks of trial, on
July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the State’s
claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed
portions of the trial judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and
ordered the case remanded to the trial judge 

44



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

to
determine the State's damages, if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also
affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial court's award of damages to
IBM. This matter remains pending in the Indiana courts.
 
        On April 16, 2014, Iusacell SA de C.V. (Iusacell) sued IBM,
claiming that IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations that induced Iusacell to
enter into an agreement with IBM Mexico. Iusacell claims $2.5 billion in
damages for lost profits. Iusacell’s complaint relates to a contractual dispute
in Mexico, which is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico
initiated by IBM Mexico against Iusacell for breach of the underlying
agreement.
 
       IBM United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal
proceedings in May 2010 before the High Court in London against the IBM UK
Pensions Trust (the UK Trust) and two representative beneficiaries of the UK
Trust membership. IBM UK is seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully both
in notifying the Trustee of the UK Trust that it was closing its UK defined
benefit plans to future accruals for most participants and in implementing the
company’s new retirement policy. On April 4, 2014, the High Court acknowledged
that the changes made to its UK defined benefit plans were within IBM’s
discretion, but ruled that IBM breached its implied duty of good faith both in
implementing these changes and in the manner in which it consulted with
employees. Proceedings to determine remedies were held in July 2014 and the
matter remains pending. In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290
individual actions brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined
benefits plans who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive
dismissal and age discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in
Southampton UK.
 
       In a separate but related proceeding, in March 2011,
the Trustee of the IBM UK Trust was granted leave to initiate a claim before
the High Court in London against IBM UK and one member of the UK Trust
membership, seeking an order modifying certain documents and terms relating to
retirement provisions in IBM UK’s largest defined benefit plan (the C Plan)
dating back to 1983. The trial of these proceedings began in May 2012 and
finished in early June. On October 12, 2012, the High Court in London issued
its ruling, holding that the 1983 Trust Deeds and Rules should be modified to
allow certain categories of current IBM UK employees who are members of the C
Plan to retire from the age of 60 (rather than from the age of 63) without
actuarial reduction of their defined benefit pension. In a supplementary ruling
on December 13, 2012, the Court declined to similarly modify the Trust Deeds
and Rules for former employees who were C Plan members and who left the company
prior to retirement. On February 7, 2013, the Court issued an order agreed to
by all parties, under which there will be no appeals of the October 2012 and
December 2012 judgments. As a result of the October 2012 ruling, IBM recorded
an additional pre-tax retirement-related obligation of $162 million in the
third quarter of 2012.
 
       On March 24, 2014, in a
suit brought by local Works Councils, the Supreme Court of Spain held that IBM
Spain’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan implemented in 1993 was null and void,
and held that current employees could reinstate their rights to a Defined
Benefit (DB) Plan, although with an offset for DC contributions paid to date. 
The Court held that IBM Spain did not consult with the Works Councils in
seeking the voluntary participation of employees in changing the pension
scheme, and recommended that IBM Spain and the Works Councils engage in
discussions over how to carry out the offset. The ruling is declaratory only.
IBM Spain has requested leave to appeal the decision to the Constitutional
Court and has started discussions with the Works Councils.
 
        In March 2011, the company announced that it had agreed to settle
a civil enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
relating to alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. On
July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011 settlement and required that for a
two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC and the court on certain matters,
including those relating to compliance with the FCPA. In early 2012, IBM
notified the SEC of an investigation by the Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau
involving allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM Poland employee in
connection with sales to the Polish government. IBM is cooperating with the SEC
and Polish authorities in this matter. In April 2013, IBM learned that the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating
allegations related to the Poland matter, as well as allegations relating to
transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The DOJ is also seeking
information regarding the company's global FCPA compliance program and its
public sector business. The company is
cooperating with the DOJ in this matter.     
 
        The company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January
1, 2008 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on
behalf of hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different
causes of action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance
and trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim
damages in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property
damages allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and
vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount. 
 

45



Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements – (continued)

       The company is party to, or otherwise
involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental
agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or laws similar to CERCLA. Such
statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation
activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also
conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in
the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to
permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local
environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning
certain current or former operating sites.
 
       The company is also subject to ongoing tax
examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with
many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in
various challenges with Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments
and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to
these matters for all applicable years is approximately $650 million. The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a
meaningful indicator of liability.    
 
14. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $5,521 million and $5,028 million at September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. A portion of these amounts was
available to the company’s business partners to support their working capital
needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to
its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately
$1,567 million and $1,769 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013,
respectively.
 
       The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 
       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach
of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets
sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the
company’s payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the
company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by
the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $44 million at September 30, 2014 and
December 31, 2013, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.

Events: On October 28, 2014, the company announced that the Board of
Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per common share. The dividend
is payable December 10, 2014 to shareholders of record on November 10, 2014.
 
       On October 28, 2014,
the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion in
additional funds for use in the company’s stock repurchase program.

Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on page 77 for additional information.
 
Operating
(non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
        In
an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the
business, the company separates business results into operating and
non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a
non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related
charges and retirement-related costs, and their related tax impacts. Operating
earnings from continuing operations excludes discontinued operations. For
acquisitions, operating earnings exclude the amortization of purchased
intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research
and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related
expenses and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For
retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain items as operating
and others as non-operating. The company includes defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost, amortization of prior
service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings.
Non-operating retirement-related cost includes defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan
assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan
curtailments/settlements and multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency
costs and other costs. Non-operating costs are primarily related to changes in
pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market
performance and the company considers these costs to be outside the operational
performance of the business.

Management Discussion –

Overall, the company believes that providing investors with a view of operating
earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into
both the operational results of the business and the performance of the
company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their
impacts on operational performance; enables better comparisons to peer
companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the
business going forward. The company’s reportable segment financial results
reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company’s management and
measurement system.

Financial Performance
Summary:
 
       In the third quarter of
2014, the company reported $22.4 billion in revenue and delivered diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.46 as reported and $3.68 on
an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The results of continuing operations exclude a net
loss from discontinued operations of $3.4 billion related to the announced
divestiture of the company’s Microelectronics business (see pages 37 and 38 for
additional information on the transaction). On a consolidated basis, net income
in the third quarter was $18 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.02.
The company generated $3.9 billion in cash from operations and $2.2 billion in
free cash flow in the third quarter driving shareholder returns of $2.8 billion
in gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 
 
       The financial results
in the third quarter fell short of the company’s expectations driven by three
primary factors. First, Software revenue was weaker than expected resulting
from some sales execution issues. In addition, the company has made it easier
for clients to manage their software capacity across new and more traditional
workloads as clients invest in the company’s platform over the longer term.
Second, the company did not get the productivity required in the Global Services
business which impacted both profit and margin in the quarter. Third, the
environment, including currency, impacted the results. Currency rates moved
sharply in September, which resulted in some impact in the third quarter, and
the company expects currency to have a larger impact going forward.
Additionally, overall, the company experienced delays in client decision-making
in September, which had a particular impact in the quarter given the skew of
the company’s transactional business. 
 
       For some time now, the
company has been clear about its strategic direction and its actions to address
the market shifts around data, cloud and engagement. Throughout 2014, the
company has been launching initiatives and making significant investments to
drive this shift. The company has been successful, with strong revenue growth
in its strategic imperatives, and that continued in the third quarter with the
strategic imperatives again delivering double-digit revenue growth. However,
some of the fundamental shifts in the industry are happening faster than the
company planned. As a result, the company is putting in place a series of
actions to accelerate its transformation:


·        
First, the company is continuing
to remix to higher value. The company took a bold step in its transformation
with the announced divestiture of the Microelectronics business to GLOBALFOUNDRIES.
The agreement leverages the strengths of each company – IBM’s semiconductor and
material science research, development capabilities and leadership in high end systems,
and GLOBALFOUNDRIES’ leadership in advanced technology manufacturing at scale
and commitment to delivering future semiconductor technologies. With
GLOBALFOUNDRIES operating at scale, the company will receive supply at
market-based pricing for the long term, and the company will exit a

business that was not only capital intensive but also
operating at a loss. 

In January, the company announced the sale of its industry standard server
business to Lenovo, and on October 1, 2014, the company completed the initial
closing of this transaction. In 2013, this was a $4.6 billion business with
effectively no annual profit. With the transaction, the company and Lenovo have
formed a strategic alliance which includes an agreement for Lenovo to resell
selected IBM storage and software products. To ensure a smooth transition for
its clients, the company will provide related maintenance on Lenovo’s behalf. 

The company will continue to remix its portfolio, by investing in higher value
areas and making decisions on businesses that no longer support its high value
strategy. 
 
·        
Second, the company is
implementing changes that will make it easier for clients to consume its
capabilities and innovations and increase its agility. The company is creating
vertically integrated units to address key growth areas. Similar to the action
taken with Watson earlier in 2014, the company is creating a dedicated business
unit for Cloud, and other integrated units to address growth areas like
security and smarter commerce. These actions will enable more focused
investment, and will improve integration and speed in bringing solutions to the
market and to the company’s clients.

To provide more flexibility to clients in the way that they purchase the
company’s software, the company is accelerating investments to make its
software more directly consumable through digital channels. As a result, the
company will have an end-to-end digital sales and marketing channel which will
improve its reach. 


·        
Third, the company is taking
additional actions to simplify its structure and accelerate productivity. For
example, to improve productivity in Global Services while providing greater
value and innovation to clients, the company will accelerate the use of
automation in its data centers and be more aggressive in the use of its global
delivery skills and intellectual property across the service lines.
 
       These actions will have
an impact on the company’s financial model. In the near term, revenue will be
down but margin will improve, as the divestitures announced and closed in 2014
represented approximately $7 billion of annual 2013 revenue and pre-tax losses
of approximately $500 million. These actions also allow spending and capital to
be reinvested to areas that will accelerate the transformation and allow for
continued strong returns to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. All of these actions are consistent with the company’s strategic
direction, and while there are impacts in the short term, they improve the
company’s position for the long term. 
 
       In the third quarter,
total consolidated revenue decreased 4.0 percent, 3.6 percent at constant
currency. Adjusting for the divested customer care business, revenue decreased
2 percent at constant currency. From a segment perspective, Global Services
revenue declined 2.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency); adjusting for
the divested customer care business, Global Services revenue was flat at
constant currency. Global Technology Services (GTS) revenue decreased 2.9
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency); adjusting for the divested customer
care business, GTS revenue increased 1 percent at constant currency driven by
the large outsourcing contracts signed in 2013. Global Business Services (GBS)
decreased 2.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). Software revenue
decreased 1.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), with middleware
essentially flat (down 1 percent adjusted for currency). Systems and Technology
revenue decreased 15.0 percent (15 percent adjusted for currency) and reflected
the product cycle impact in System z and declines in Power Systems, Storage and
System x. 
 
       From a geographic
perspective, revenue in the major markets declined 3.4 percent as reported and
3 percent adjusted for currency, a 2 point sequential deceleration from the
second quarter at constant currency. Revenue in the growth markets declined 5.6
percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency, a 1 point sequential
deceleration from the second quarter at constant currency. Within the growth
markets, the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) decreased 6.9
percent as reported and 7 percent at constant currency. 
 
       The consolidated gross
profit margin decreased 0.4 points versus the third quarter of 2013 to 48.6
percent. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 49.2 percent decreased 0.9
points year to year driven primarily by weak hardware performance and
insufficient productivity in services. The Systems & Technology gross
margin declined 5.9 points year to year due to a combination of lower margins
across the brands and a mix away from the higher margin System z due to the
product cycle. GTS realized savings from the workforce rebalancing action taken
earlier in 2014 and continues to make investments in capacity and skills.
However, GTS did not deliver planned base productivity and the transition of
some new contracts took

longer than expected. In GBS,
the company had strong growth with good margin performance in the strategic
imperatives, however, in the more traditional back office implementations the
company continues to see price pressure.
 
       Total expense and other
(income) increased 0.9 percent in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the
prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 2.3
percent year to year. The company has been shifting its spending to drive the
strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. With the actions being
taken, the shift in base spending will accelerate. The year-to-year drivers
were approximately:

       There were two items that had an impact on total expense
and other (income) year to year. Bad debt expense increased $72 million year to
year in the third quarter. The company has a performance-based compensation
structure, and as a result of the business not performing as expected, the
accrual for 2014 performance-based compensation in the third quarter is down
relative to the first half of 2014. However, the reduction in the third quarter
of 2014 was not as substantial as the reduction in the third-quarter of 2013.
As a result, performance-based compensation across both cost and expense was up
approximately $230 million year to year. 
 
       Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $4,361 million
decreased 12.3 percent year to year and the pre-tax margin was 19.5 percent, a
decrease of 1.8 points versus the third quarter of 2013. The continuing
operations effective tax rate for the third quarter was 20.8 percent, an
increase of 4.0 points year to year. Income from continuing operations of
$3,455 million decreased 16.5 percent year to year and the loss from
discontinued operations, net of tax, was $3,437 million in the third quarter of
2014 compared to $98 million in the third quarter of 2013. Net income of $18
million decreased $4,023 million year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax
income from continuing operations  decreased 14.9 percent year to year and the
operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin was 20.7 percent, a decrease of 2.6 points
year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations decreased
18.2 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin of 16.4 percent
decreased 2.8 points compared to the prior year. The operating (non-GAAP)
effective tax rate from continuing operations was 20.8 percent versus 17.6
percent in the third quarter of 2013. 
 
       Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of
$3.46 decreased 8.2 percent year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings
per share of $3.68 decreased 9.8 percent versus the third quarter of 2013.
Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was ($3.44) compared to
($0.09) in the third quarter of 2013. In the third quarter, the company
repurchased 9.1 million shares of its common stock. 
 
        The company generated $3,904 million in
cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $145 million
compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower workforce
rebalancing payments ($431 million), partially offset by a higher level of cash
tax payments ($332 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $800
million decreased $1,748 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to
decreased spending for acquisitions ($2,336 million). Net cash used in
financing activities of $2,820 million increased $1,993 million compared to the
prior year, primarily due to lower net debt issuances. 
 
       In summary, the company is taking actions to make it easier
for clients to do business with it, including creating vertically integrated
units to address key growth areas and making its software more consumable
through digital channels. Additional actions are being taken to drive more
productivity and increase the agility of the company. While the company is
continuing to invest to shift to higher value areas, it is also aggressively
moving away from the businesses that do not fit its strategic portfolio. The
sale of the industry standard server business and the announced divestiture of
the Microelectronics business are the two most recent examples. All of these
actions support the company’s shift to higher value.       
 
       For the full year 2013, the company reported $14.94 in
diluted earnings per share. Reclassified to reflect discontinued operations,
full-year 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was
$15.30, and diluted earnings per share

from
discontinued operations was $(0.36). The loss from discontinued operations, net
of tax, in 2013 was $398 million. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share, on a
continuing operations basis, was $16.64 for the full year 2013 versus the
previously reported $16.28. See page 88 for a detailed reconciliation of 2013
reclassified net income to operating earnings.
 
       In October 2014, the company stated that it is expecting
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be flat to down 2 percent
for the full year 2014 compared to $15.30 in the prior year. The company also
stated that it expects operating (non-GAAP) earnings, on a continuing
operations basis, to be down 2 percent to down 4 percent for the full year 2014
compared to $16.64 in the prior year. See the Looking Forward section on page
76 for additional information regarding the company’s expectations.

Financial Performance Summary:
 
       In the first nine
months of 2014, the company reported revenue of $68.7 billion, income from
continuing operations of $10,237 million and diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations of $10.09 as reported and $10.76 on an operating
(non-GAAP) basis. The results of continuing operations exclude a net loss from
discontinued operations of $3,698 million in the first nine months of 2014 and
$366 million in the first nine months of 2013. The company generated $10.8
billion in cash from operations and $5.8 billion in free cash flow in the first
nine months of 2014 driving shareholder returns of $16.7 billion in gross
common stock repurchases and dividends.
 
      
Total consolidated revenue decreased 3.2 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to the first nine months of 2013. Adjusting for the divested
customer care business, revenue decreased 2 percent at constant currency. The
company has a set of offerings that address the strategic areas of data, cloud
and the way clients are engaging. Revenue in the strategic imperatives was up
double digits in the first nine months of 2014 with approximately half of the
content in software. Business analytics revenue increased 8 percent with the
strongest growth coming from GBS. This is a large business for the company with
revenues in 2013 of nearly $16 billion. The company has a broad analytics
portfolio that helps clients to extract value from their data. Cloud revenue
was up over 50 percent year to year. The delivered as-a-service component was
up over 80 percent and exited the third quarter with an annual run rate of $3.1
billion. The company’s cloud portfolio supports the full scope of enterprise
client cloud requirements, including solutions for private, hybrid and public
clouds. In engagement, mobile revenue more than doubled year to year, social
offerings returned to growth, with double-digit growth in the third quarter,
and security revenue was up over 20 percent. This was the 8th
consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in security.
 
       The company
continues to launch initiatives and make significant investments to drive the
shift toward the strategic imperatives. For example:               
 
·        
Earlier in 2014,
the company created a Watson unit and committed $1 billion to bring Watson’s
cognitive capabilities to the enterprise, and
·        
The company
launched Bluemix; is globally expanding SoftLayer’s cloud data centers; and,
formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility. 


      
From a segment perspective, Software revenue was flat year to year as reported
and at constant currency. Middleware revenue increased 2.1 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency). Global Services revenue declined 2.0 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency). Adjusted for the divested customer care business,
Global Services revenue increased 1 percent at constant currency. Global
Technology Services (GTS) declined 2.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency); adjusting for the divested customer care business, GTS revenue
increased 2 percent at constant currency. Global Business Services revenue
decreased 1.3 percent as reported, flat adjusted for currency. Systems and
Technology revenue decreased 16.0 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency).
On a geographic basis, revenue in the growth markets declined 7.7 percent (5
percent adjusted for currency) and the major markets declined 1.7 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency). 
 
      
The consolidated gross margin of 48.8 percent improved 0.5 points year to year.
The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 49.5 percent was flat compared to the
prior year. An improved mix toward Software was offset by a margin decline in
Systems and Technology. 
 
      
Total expense and other (income) decreased 2.6 percent in the first nine months
of 2014 compared to the prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and
other (income) decreased 1.5 percent compared to the first nine months of 2013.
The key drivers of the year-to-year change in total expense and other (income)

There were several significant items that had an impact on total expense and
other (income) year to year. Workforce rebalancing charges for the first nine
months of 2014 were $894 million compared to $1,015 million in the prior year.
In addition, the company recorded pre-tax gains of $365 million in the first
nine months of 2014 related to divestitures, including $212 million related to
the divestiture of the customer care outsourcing business. Bad debt expense
increased $148 million year to year driven by specific provision additions. The
receivables provision coverage was 2.2 percent at September 30, 2014, an
increase of 60 basis points from December 31, 2013 and 60 basis points from
September 30, 2013.
 
       Pre-tax income from continuing operations decreased 1.9
percent year to year and the pre-tax margin was 18.8 percent, an increase of
0.3 points year to year. The effective tax rate for the first nine months was
20.6 percent, compared with 18.9 percent in the prior year. Income from continuing
operations of $10,237 million decreased 4.0 percent and the net income margin
was 14.9 percent, a decrease of 0.1 points year to year. Loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was $3,698 million in the first nine months of 2014
compared to $366 million in the first nine months of 2013. Net income of $6,539
million decreased $3,760 million year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax
income from continuing operations decreased 5.4 percent year to year and the operating
(non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations declined 0.5 points to
20.0 percent versus the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing
operations of $10,917 million decreased 6.8 percent and the operating
(non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 15.9 percent decreased
0.6 points. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing
operations for the first nine months was 20.6 percent versus 19.5 percent in
2013.   
 
       Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.09
increased 5.1 percent compared to the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted
earnings per share of $10.76 increased 2.1 percent year to year in the first
nine months. In the first nine months of 2014, the company repurchased 70.9
million shares of its common stock.
 
       At September 30,
2014, the company’s balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong and
well positioned to support the business over the long term. Cash and marketable
securities at quarter end were $9,565 million, a decrease of $1,501 million
from December 31, 2013. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows
are:
 
      
Total assets decreased $7,312 million ($4,029 million adjusted for currency)
from December 31, 2013 driven by:
 
·        
Decreases in total receivables
($5,596 million), property, plant and equipment ($2,753 million) driven
primarily by the impairment of the long-lived semiconductor assets ($2,353
million), and cash and cash equivalents ($1,155 million); partially offset by
 
·        
Increased prepaid pension assets
($1,892 million). 
 
      
Total liabilities increased $1,222 million ($3,905 million adjusted for
currency) from December 31, 2013 driven by:
 
·        
Increases in total debt ($5,979
million) and accruals related to the Microelectronics divestiture ($2,337
million); partially offset by
 
·        
Decreases in current taxes payable
($2,158 million), deferred income ($1,635 million) and accounts payable ($1,606
million). 
 
      
Total equity of $14,395 million decreased $8,534 million from December 31, 2013
as a result of:
 
·        
Increased treasury stock ($13,374
million) driven by share repurchases; partially offset by
 
·        
Higher retained earnings ($3,362
million), higher common stock ($852 million) and decreased losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) ($623 million).
 
       The company generated
$10,809 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of
$148 million compared to the first nine months of 2013, driven primarily by a
higher level of cash tax payments ($1,521 million), partially offset by increased
cash provided by receivables ($868 million). Net cash used in investing
activities of $1,765 million was $2,659 million lower than the first nine
months of 2013, primarily due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions
($1,912 million). Net cash used in financing activities of $9,753 million
increased $2,883 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by increased
cash used for gross common stock purchases ($5,485 million), partially offset
by higher net cash proceeds from total debt ($3,022 million).

  Global
Technology Services revenue of $9,218 million decreased 2.9 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2014. Normalizing for the
divestiture of the customer care business, revenue increased 0.3 percent (1
percent adjusted for currency). GTS revenue decreased 2.3 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency) to $27,962 million in the first nine months of 2014.
However, adjusted for the divestiture, revenue increased 0.5 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency). Within GTS, SoftLayer continues to attract new
workloads to the platform as its footprint expands. In the third quarter, cloud
data centers were opened in London and Toronto, as well as two federal datacenters
outside of Dallas and Washington D.C. Cloud capacity was also added in
Singapore. GTS Outsourcing grew 0.8 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in
the third quarter when normalized for the customer care divestiture. That
growth was driven by performance from the substantial new contracts brought on
during 2013.
 Global Business Services revenue of $4,459 million decreased 2.2
percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2014 and
decreased 1.3 percent (flat adjusted for currency) for the first nine months of
the year. Consulting and Systems Integration (C&SI) revenue declined 0.8
percent (flat adjusted for currency) in the third quarter. There was strong
double digit growth in the practices that are highly differentiated in the
marketplace which address cloud, analytics, mobile and social. This was offset
by declines in the areas that are becoming less differentiated such as the more
traditional back office implementations. As announced in July, the company has
formed a strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of “enterprise
ready” MobileFirst business applications for iOS combining mobility and
analytics. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the first dozen applications are
expected to be launched. Application Outsourcing revenue decreased 7.1 percent
(6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter, reflecting modest
sequential improvement compared to the second quarter of this year. Performance
continues to be impacted by pricing pressure and client renegotiations, as well
as a reduction in elective projects.

       GTS gross profit margin decreased 0.5 points in the
third quarter but increased 0.4 points for the first nine months of 2014
compared to prior year. In the third quarter, pre-tax income decreased 11.3
percent to $1,680 million and the pre-tax margin declined 1.7 points to 17.7
percent compared to the prior year. While benefits continue from the workforce rebalancing
actions earlier this year, these benefits were more than offset in the third
quarter. Investments across the portfolio in areas like new resiliency centers,
additional security skills and the SoftLayer cloud hub expansion and the lost
profit from the divested customer care business have contributed to this
performance. Additionally, there was not sufficient productivity in the base, partially
due to the large deals signed in 2013 which have lower margins in the early
stages and where the transition was not executed as rapidly as expected.  
 
        GBS gross profit margin decreased 1.6 and 0.5
points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively,
compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income decreased 15.0 percent to $805
million and the pre-tax margin declined 2.5 points to 17.5 percent in the third
quarter. GBS also continued to benefit from the previous workforce rebalancing
actions, but this was more than offset by other factors which included the
impact of lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base. In areas where the
company has strong differentiation, such as solutions that address the
strategic imperatives, there is good growth and gross margin performance.
However, in the parts of the portfolio that are not as well differentiated,
there is continued price and profit pressure. In these areas, the company will
be more aggressive on the use of global delivery centers and in applying intellectual
property for faster time to value for its clients and improved business results
for the company.

        The estimated Global Services backlog at September 30, 2014 was
$128 billion, a decrease of 9.3 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to the September 30, 2013 balance. This includes a backlog reduction
in 2014 of $3.6 billion associated with the customer care divestiture.
Adjusting for the divestiture, backlog was down 6.7 percent (2 percent adjusted
for currency) year to year. The
estimated transactional backlog at September 30, 2014 decreased 3.7 percent
(flat adjusted for currency) from the September 30, 2013 levels. The estimated
outsourcing backlog decreased 12.3 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency)
including the backlog reduction from the customer care divestiture. Adjusting for the divestiture, the estimated
outsourcing backlog decreased 8.2 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to the September 30, 2013 balance.

        Total Global Services backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS,
GBS Outsourcing, Consulting and Systems Integration and Maintenance.
Outsourcing backlog includes GTS Outsourcing and GBS Outsourcing. Transactional
backlog includes ITS and Consulting and Systems Integration. Total backlog is
intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and therefore does
include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected
by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts,
periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and
adjustments for currency.
 
Global Services signings are management’s
initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a Global Services
contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the
calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates
and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type
and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or
wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS
Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems Integration
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in
signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues
equal renewals.
 
Contract portfolios purchased in an
acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those
contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing
will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or
coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       Software revenue of $5,708 million decreased 1.6
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and increased
0.4 percent (flat adjusted for currency) to $17,857 million in the first nine
months of 2014, respectively. In the third quarter, middleware decreased 0.4
percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) while operating systems were down
11.0 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency). In the third quarter, the
company did have solid growth in many of its solution areas, including security,
mobile and cloud. In addition, across the software brands,
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings were up nearly 50 percent versus the
third quarter of 2013. However, overall software results did not meet the
company’s expectations. First, there were some sales execution issues. Second,
given clients substantial investment in the IBM software platform, the company
has been providing more flexibility on how clients deploy its software, and
with economics that enable their mobile and social workloads on its platforms.
This enables clients to better manage their capacity and commit to the
company’s platforms for the long term. This will drive higher utilization of
the company’s middleware as these mobile and social platforms drive additional
on-premise workload. 
 
       Key
branded middleware revenue, which accounted for 65 percent of total Software
revenue in the third quarter of 2014, decreased 0.8 percent (1 percent adjusted
for currency) compared to the prior year. In the first nine
months of 2014, key branded middleware grew 1.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency) and accounted for 65 percent of total Software revenue.
 
      
WebSphere revenue increased 6.7 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) and
7.8 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2014 year to year, respectively.   Performance in
the third quarter was led by commerce, mobile solutions and business
integration offerings. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to
WebSphere growth, with the majority of this growth coming from on-premise
solutions. In commerce, there was broad based growth with strong momentum in
Commerce-as-a-Service which includes recent acquisitions like Silverpop and
Aspera.  Across software and services, the company’s mobile business more than
doubled from the prior year in the third quarter.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       Information Management revenue decreased 4.9 percent
(5 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and decreased 1.6
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2014
compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, performance was impacted by
sales execution challenges and some product transitions.  
 
       Tivoli revenue increased 2.5 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and 4.1 percent (4 percent adjusted
for currency) in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the prior year
periods. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by security and storage
software. Security grew again at a double digit rate, marking its twelfth
consecutive quarter of growth with most of those quarters increasing by double
digits. 
 
      
Workforce Solutions revenue increased 1.4 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and decreased 3.5 percent (4 percent adjusted
for currency) in the first nine months of 2014 year to year, respectively.
Performance in the quarter included growth in social and collaboration
solutions, mitigated by a decline in Notes. 
 
      
Rational revenue decreased 12.3 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) year
to year in the third quarter and decreased 7.3 percent (7 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first nine months of 2014. In the third quarter, the
brand faced a difficult comparison to strong performance in the prior year. 
 
       Across
software, the company is transitioning its portfolio to capture growth areas,
while continuing to drive innovation in its core franchise. In addition, the
company will be accelerating investment to make its software more consumable
though digital channels.

       Systems and Technology (STG) revenue decreased 15.0 percent (15
percent adjusted for currency) and 16.0 percent (16 percent adjusted for
currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively,
versus the same periods in 2013. This performance reflects year-to-year
declines related to the product cycle of System z as well as declines in Power,
Storage and System x. Although both Power and Storage declined compared to the
prior year, both brands improved sequentially compared to the second quarter of
2014. The company continues to take significant actions within this business
segment.  Recently, the company completed the initial closing of the sale of
its industry standard server (System x) business to Lenovo, reached an
agreement to divest its Microelectronics business to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and
introduced the first OpenPOWER based scale-out systems.
 
       System z revenue decreased 35.0 percent (35 percent adjusted for
currency) and 22.0 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively, compared to the prior year
periods. In the ninth quarter of the current product cycle, the company
continues to innovate on this platform. For example, the company recently made
available new analytics offerings for the mainframe to provide Real-Time
Customer Insights. With this, the company added new analytics capabilities to
the mainframe platform providing clients with the ability to integrate Hadoop
big data. 
 
       Power Systems revenue decreased 12.2 percent (12 percent adjusted
for currency) and 21.3 percent (21 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively, compared to the
prior year periods. This represented a double digit sequential improvement in
the year-to-year growth rate compared to the second quarter of this year. The
company has repositioned Power Systems. In June, scale-out systems based on
POWER8 were introduced and high-end POWER8 based enterprise systems were
announced in October. These newly announced systems are highly scalable and can
handle the most data intensive, mission critical applications in the industry.
In addition, the company saw continued expansion of the OpenPOWER consortium,
now with over 60 members. Through the efforts of the consortium members, the
company has for the first time introduced a system built on the POWER8
processor that tightly integrates IBM and other OpenPOWER member technologies,
including NVIDIA’s GPU accelerator technology.
 
       System x revenue decreased 9.6
percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) and 10.1 percent (10 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014,
respectively, compared to the prior year periods. This is the final quarter
before the System x divestiture.
 
       Storage revenue decreased 6.3
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) and 13.7 percent (14 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014,
respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The third quarter
year-to-year rate was a sequential improvement compared to the 12 percent
decrease in the second quarter of this

year. The third
quarter again included strong contribution from Flash Systems and the Storwize
portfolio. This was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the
continued wind-down of the legacy OEM business. The company sees the value
in the storage business shifting to software, and in the third quarter, storage
software revenue grew. The company plans to continue to expand its software
defined storage portfolio.

       Systems and Technology’s gross
profit margin decreased 5.9 points in the third quarter of 2014 versus the
prior year. The decrease was driven by lower
margins in System x (1.4 points), Power Systems (1.2 points), and Storage (1.1
points), and a decline due to mix (2.3 points), driven by a mix away from
higher margin System z due to the product cycle. The
gross profit margin for the first nine months of 2014 decreased 3.9 points
compared to the first nine months of 2013. The decrease was driven by lower
margins in Power Systems (1.4 points), Storage (1.0 points) and System x (0.7
points), and a decline due to revenue mix (1.3 points). 
 
        Systems and Technology’s pre-tax loss
increased $91 million to $99 million in the third quarter and its pre-tax loss increased
$222 million to $354 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to
prior year periods. Pre-tax margin decreased 3.5 points in the third quarter
and decreased 3.0 points in the first nine months versus the prior year
periods. 
       Across the Systems and Technology business, the company has taken
significant actions to reposition the portfolio and maintain its commitment to
driving innovation in its high-end systems and storage.  It has committed a $3
billion investment in the next era of chip technology as the company
strengthens its semiconductor R&D and systems innovation, with future chip
supply coming from an at-scale manufacturer. The company has repositioned Power
Systems through creation of POWER8 systems which are built for cloud and big
data, and it has also made available the POWER8 architecture through the
OpenPOWER consortium to build an open eco-system and an IP offering. Storage is
being repositioned to capture value through software defined environments, and
the company has divested its low-end industry standard server business.

       Total
geographic revenue of $22,276 million decreased 3.9 percent (3 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. In
total, major market countries decreased 3.4 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) and growth market countries decreased 5.6 percent (5 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter of 2014. These results include the impact of
the customer care divestiture which accounted for one point of the decline in
the constant currency growth rates for both the major and growth markets. In
the month of September, nearly all regions experienced a deceleration and it
was most pronounced in the growth markets that have a higher transactional
content. Comparing year-to-year performance to the previous quarter, major
markets decelerated 3.1 points (2 points adjusted for currency) and growth
markets improved 1.2 points, but decelerated 1 point adjusted for currency, in
the third quarter.
 
       In the
growth markets, there was growth in both Latin America and the Middle East and
Africa region. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew at a double-digit
rate in Latin America, however, the Asia Pacific countries declined at a
double-digit rate. Within the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and
China, combined revenue decreased 6.9 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency)
in the third quarter. While Brazil grew 13.3 percent (13 percent adjusted for
currency), China decreased 19.0 percent (19 percent adjusted for currency),
India decreased 4.8 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency), and Russia
declined 9.1 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) on a year-to-year basis.

 
      
Americas revenue decreased 2.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency)
compared to the third quarter of 2013. Within the major markets, the U.S. was
down 3.4 percent year to year and Canada was down 6.3 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency). The Latin America growth markets increased 9.7 percent
as reported (13 percent adjusted for currency) driven by the strong performance
in Brazil.

       EMEA revenue decreased 2.2 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) year to year in the third quarter of 2014. Within the
major markets, Germany decreased 0.8 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency),
the UK decreased 3.2 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) and France
decreased 10.4 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the third
quarter of 2013. These decreases were partially offset by year-to-year growth
in several of the smaller major market countries with Spain increasing 10.1
percent (10 percent adjusted for currency), Switzerland increasing 4.5 percent
(3 percent adjusted for currency), and the Netherlands increasing 4.7 percent
(5 percent adjusted for currency). The EMEA growth markets decreased 3.6
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) driven by declines in Russia and
other Eastern European countries, partially offset by growth in the Middle East
and Africa region which increased 2.1 percent (4 percent adjusted for
currency).
  
       Asia
Pacific third quarter revenue decreased 9.5 percent (8 percent adjusted for
currency) year over year. Japan decreased 5.9 percent (1 percent adjusted for
currency). Asia Pacific growth market countries decreased 11.8 percent (13
percent adjusted for currency) compared to the third quarter of 2013.
 
       Total geographic revenue of $68,336 million for the
first nine months of 2014 decreased 3.1 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) compared to the prior year. Major markets decreased 1.7 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency) and the growth market countries decreased 7.7
percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) for the first nine months of the
year. Within the BRIC countries, combined revenue was down year to year 6.6
percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) driven by China which decreased 16.3
percent (16 percent adjusted for currency). While the company had strength in
Latin America during the first nine months of the year, declines in some of the
larger growth markets, such as China, Australia and Korea, impacted the overall
performance in the growth markets.
 
       Americas revenue for the first nine months of 2014
decreased 2.4 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior
year. The major market countries were down 3.4 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency), partially offset by an increase in the Latin America growth markets
of 5.0 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency). Within the major market
countries, the U.S. was down 2.6 percent and Canada was down 8.5 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency). Within the Latin America growth market
countries, Brazil increased 10.1 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency) and
Mexico decreased 3.2 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency).
 
       EMEA revenue increased 1.1 percent (decreased 2
percent adjusted for currency) for the first nine months of 2014 compared to
the prior year. The major market countries increased 1.7 percent (decreased 2
percent adjusted for currency), while the growth market countries decreased 3.5
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency). In the major market countries,
Germany increased 7.5 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency), Italy
increased 4.8 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), the UK decreased 3.1
percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) and France decreased 6.0 percent (9
percent adjusted for currency). 
 
       Asia Pacific revenue decreased 10.1 percent (7
percent adjusted for currency) year to year for the first nine months of 2014.
Japan decreased 5.2 percent as reported, but increased 1 percent on a constant
currency basis. The Asia Pacific growth markets decreased 13.4 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency). 
 
       Geographic revenue results in future quarters will
reflect the industry standard server divestiture which is expected to impact
major markets by approximately 3 points and growth markets by approximately 9
points. Reporting of the Microelectronics business as a discontinued operation
will adjust the OEM revenue, but have no impact on geographic results.

       Total Selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expense increased 0.4 percent (1 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013. The
increase was primarily driven by acquisition-related spending (1 point), offset
by lower base expense (1 point). Operating (non-GAAP) SG&A expense
increased 1.5 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) primarily driven by acquisition-related
spending (1 point) and higher base expense (1 point). Bad debt expense
increased $72 million year to year driven by specific provision additions.
 
       SG&A expense decreased 1.8 percent
(1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2014 versus the first
nine months of 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by lower base expense (3
points) and the effects of currency (1 point), partially offset by acquisition-related
spending (2 points). Operating (non-GAAP) SG&A expense decreased 1.1
percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) primarily driven by lower base
expense (2 points) and the effects of currency (1 point), partially offset by acquisition-related
spending (2 points). Workforce rebalancing charges in the first nine months of
2014 were $894 million, a decrease of $121 million year to year, which resulted
in a 1 point year-to-year improvement in the operating (non-GAAP) SG&A base
performance. Bad debt expense increased $148 million year to year driven by
specific provision additions. The receivables provision coverage was 2.2
percent at September 30, 2014, an increase of 60 basis points from year-end
2013 and 60 basis points from September 30, 2013.

        Other (income)
and expense was income of $103 million and $63 million in the third quarter of
2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in income of $40 million year over
year was primarily driven by higher gains from foreign currency transactions ($739
million) and increased gains associated with divestitures ($74 million),
partially offset by higher losses on derivative instruments ($792 million). 
 
       Other (income) and expense was income of $433 million and $217

       The increase in interest expense for the third quarter and
first nine months of 2014 versus the same periods of 2013 was primarily driven
by higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest
rates. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support
the Global Financing external business. See page 84 for additional information
regarding Global Financing debt and interest expense. Overall interest expense
(excluding capitalized interest) for the third quarter and first nine months of
2014 was $255 million and $774 million, respectively, an increase of $14
million and $41 million, respectively, year to year.

       In the third quarter, total retirement-related plans
cost decreased by $230 million compared to the third quarter of 2013, primarily
driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($237 million), higher expected
return on plan assets ($47 million) and lower defined contribution plans cost
($28 million), partially offset by higher interest cost ($71 million). Total
cost for the first nine months of 2014 decreased $681 million versus the first
nine months of 2013, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial
losses ($699 million), higher expected return on plan assets ($164 million) and
lower defined contribution plans cost ($84 million), partially offset by higher
interest cost ($226 million).

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

        As discussed in the “Snapshot” on page 48, the
company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others
as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related
costs in the third quarter were $404 million, a decrease of $44 million
compared to the third quarter of 2013, primarily driven by lower defined
contribution plans cost ($28 million). Non-operating costs of $71 million
decreased $186 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year driven
primarily by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($237 million) and higher
expected return on plan assets ($47 million), partially offset by higher
interest cost ($71 million). For the first nine months of 2014, operating
retirement-related costs were $1,238 million, a decrease of $124 million
compared to the first nine months of 2013, primarily driven by lower defined
contribution plans cost ($84 million) and lower service cost ($38 million). Non-operating
costs of $246 million decreased $557 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared
to the prior year driven primarily by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses
($699 million) and higher expected return on plan assets ($164 million),
partially offset by higher interest cost ($226 million).
       See note 8, "Retirement-Related Benefits,"
for additional plan cost detail.
  
Taxes
 
        The
continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2014 was 20.8
percent compared to an effective tax rate of 16.7 percent for the third quarter
of 2013. The continuing operations effective tax rates for the first nine
months of 2014 and 2013 were 20.6 percent and 18.9 percent, respectively. The
operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2014 was 20.8 percent
compared to 17.6 percent for the third quarter of 2013. The operating
(non-GAAP) tax rate for the first nine months of 2014 was 20.6 percent compared
to 19.5 percent for the first nine months of 2013.
 
       The increase in the third quarter tax rates compared
to the prior year was primarily due to a discrete benefit in the prior year
driven by foreign tax audit activity. The year-to-year increase in the tax
rates for the first nine months was driven by the lack of the third quarter
2013 foreign tax audit benefit, the lack of a favorable tax agreement received
in the second quarter of 2013 which required a reassessment of certain
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets (approximately $288 million), the
lack of the first quarter 2013 benefits associated with the retroactive impact
of the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief Act (approximately $135 million) and newly
enacted state legislation (approximately $125 million).  These impacts were
partially offset by an increase in the expected utilization of foreign tax
credits.
  
       With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing
jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations
for years prior to 2008. The company is no longer subject to income tax
examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2011. The open
years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of
applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount and/or timing
of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is
always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and
interest have been provided for any material adverse adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2013 decreased $65 million in the third quarter of 2014 and increased $52
million in the first nine months of 2014 to $4,510 million. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate was $3,972 million at September 30, 2014.
  
In April 2010, the company appealed the determination of
the Japan Tax Authorities with respect to certain foreign tax losses. The tax
benefit of these losses, approximately $1,092 million, has been included in
unrecognized tax benefits. In April 2011, the company received notification
that the appeal had been denied, and in June 2011, the company filed a lawsuit
challenging this decision. In May 2014, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favor
of the company. The Japanese government has appealed this ruling to the Tokyo
High Court. No final determination has been reached on this matter. 
 
       In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company received
a draft tax assessment notice for approximately $866 million from the Indian
Tax Authorities for 2009. Due to the impact of currency, the assessment is
valued at $868 million at September 30, 2014.  The company believes it will
prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of
liability. At September 30, 2014, the company has recorded $461 million as
prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents
cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the company’s right to appeal
various income tax assessments made by the Indian tax authorities.
  
       In the first quarter of 2014, the IRS commenced its
audit of the company’s U.S. tax returns for 2011 and 2012. The company
anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end of 2015.

Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

       Actual
shares outstanding at September 30, 2014 were 989.7 million. The
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during
the third quarter and first nine months of 2014 were 101.1 million and 95.9
million shares lower, respectively, than the same periods in 2013, primarily as
a result of the company’s common stock repurchase program.
 
Results of
Discontinued Operations
       The loss from discontinued
operations in the third quarter includes a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $4.7
billion, or $3.3 billion, net of tax. The charge includes an impairment to
reflect the fair value less estimated costs to sell the Microelectronics business,
which the company reported as held for sale at September 30, 2014. The charge
also includes other estimated costs related to the transaction, including cash
consideration expected to be transferred of approximately $1.5 billion. The
cash consideration is expected to be paid over the next three years and will be
adjusted down by the amount of the working capital due by GLOBALFOUNDRIES to
the company, estimated to be $0.2 billion.  
                                          
       In addition, discontinued operations
includes operational net losses from the Microelectronics business of $0.1
billion in both the third quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2013. The
discontinued operations effective tax rate in the third quarter was 29.0
percent compared to 38.2 percent for the third quarter of 2013. The tax rate
for the first nine months of 2014 was 29.1 percent compared to 37.0 percent for
the first nine months of 2013. The decrease in the respective rates for both
periods was driven by a one-time tax charge of $428 million in the third
quarter of 2014 in connection with the disposal.

"Acquisitions/Divestitures," on pages 37 and 38 for additional

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At September 30, 2014, the company continues to have
the financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $9,565 million. Total debt of $45,696
million increased $5,979 million from prior year-end levels, driven by an
increase in commercial paper of $4,016 million. The commercial paper balance at
September 30, 2014 was $6,474 million, with a weighted-average interest rate of
0.1 percent. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet
its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. In the first nine months of
2014, the company generated $10,809 million in cash from operations, a decrease
of $148 million compared to the first nine months of 2013. The company has
consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have
access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its
$10 billion global credit facility. 
 
       The assets and debt associated with the Global
Financing business are a significant part of the company’s financial
position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are
the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in
the separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 80, are supplementary
data presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.

·        
An increase in deferred taxes of
$569 million ($621 million adjusted for currency), driven by the
Microelectronics divestiture, and,
 
·        
An increase of $534 million ($682
million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other primarily driven
by an increase in derivative assets of $321 million primarily as a result of
changes in foreign currency rates.
 
       Current liabilities
increased $2,151 million ($3,364 million adjusted for currency), as a result
of:
 
·        
An increase in short-term debt of
$6,014 million ($6,034 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by an
increase in commercial paper and by reclasses from long-term debt to reflect
upcoming maturities, net of payments due to maturities (see debt analysis on
page 84); partially offset by
 
·        
A decrease in taxes payable of
$2,158 million ($2,036 million adjusted for currency) due primarily to tax
payments in the U.S; and
 
·        
A decrease in accounts payable of
$1,606 million ($1,435 million adjusted for currency) reflecting declines from
typically higher year-end balances.

months of 2013 driven by the following factors:
 
·      An increase in income taxes paid of $1,521
million primarily driven by audit settlement payments and other prior period
discrete tax impacts settled in the first quarter of 2014, and
 
·      A decrease in cash associated with

Debt
 
       The company’s funding requirements are continually
monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability
profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access
global funding sources as needed.

       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate
long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset
portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 84.
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
       “Core” debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding
Global Financing debt and equity) was 61.9 percent at September 30, 2014
compared to 39.0 percent at December 31, 2013 and 38.7 percent at September 30,
2013. While the charge related to the announced divestiture of the
Microelectronics business did not effect the company’s debt levels, it did
impact equity by approximately $3.3 billion, resulting in a 7 point impact to
the “core” debt-to-capitalization ratio.         
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio at
September 30, 2014 was 76.0 percent versus 63.4 percent at December 31, 2013
and 64.4 percent at September 30, 2013.   
 
Equity
 
       Total equity decreased by $8,534 million from
December 31, 2013 as a result of an increase in treasury stock of $13,374
million primarily related to gross common stock repurchases in the first nine
months of 2014, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $3,362
million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $623 million
and an increase in common stock of $852 million.
 
Looking Forward 
 
       The company measures the success of its
business model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The
company’s strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective
of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the
company is well-positioned to take advantage of major shifts occurring in
technology, business and the global economy. 
 
       Within the IT industry, there are major
shifts occurring – driven by data, cloud and changes in the way individuals and
enterprises are engaging. In the first nine months of 2014, the company had
good performance in its offerings that address these shifts, including business
analytics, cloud, mobile and security. The company continued to take
significant actions to drive the shift toward its strategic imperatives –
examples include the targeted investments in SoftLayer capacity, the Bluemix
launch, Watson, POWER8, chip innovation and the Apple partnership. The company
is focused on allocating its 

75



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

capital efficiently and
effectively – which means investing in the right places, as well as moving away
from areas that do not support the company’s strategic profile. This is an
important part of the company’s model. The sale of the industry standard server
business, the agreement to divest the Microelectronics business and the
divestiture of the customer care business are the most recent examples. The
annual revenue from these three businesses was $7 billion in 2013, and in
aggregate, they incurred a pre-tax loss of more than $500 million. In addition,
exiting the third quarter, the company is taking actions to make it easier for
clients to do business with the company – including creating vertically
integrated units to address key growth areas, and making its software more
consumable through digital channels. The company is also taking additional
actions to simplify its structure, accelerate productivity and increase the
agility of the company. All of these actions will impact the company’s
financial model – in the near term, revenue will be down, but the company will
have an improved margin profile. In addition, these actions will free up
spending and capital to be reinvested in areas that will accelerate the
company’s transformation, and enable continued return of value to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases. All of these actions are consistent
with the company’s strategic direction, and while there are impacts in the
short term, they will improve the company’s position for the longer term.  
 
       Looking forward in 2014, the company’s
operating (non-GAAP) results will be on a continuing operations basis, which
excludes the Microelectronics business in the current and prior periods. As
discussed on pages 51 and 52, when adjusting for the discontinued operations in
the base, the company’s full year 2013 operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share
was $16.64 versus the $16.28 previously reported for 2013. Within this new
operating (non-GAAP) definition, the company has considered a number of items
in its earnings expectations for the full year 2014. First, the company has
completed the initial closing of the sale of the industry standard server
business, and as stated above, the company will no longer have the revenue and
profit associated with that business. This will result in an approximately 4
point impact to revenue growth in each of the next four quarters. On a
geographic basis, revenue growth in the major markets will be impacted by
approximately 3 points, and in the growth markets the impact will be approximately
9 points. In addition, the company will have a 1 point impact to revenue growth
in the fourth quarter resulting from the customer care divestiture earlier this
year. At current spot rates, the company expects revenue growth in the fourth
quarter to be adversely impacted by 3 points from currency. Excluding the
expected effects of currency and divestitures, the company’s earnings per share
expectation for the fourth quarter does not include an improved revenue
trajectory. In the fourth quarter, the company will report a gain on the sale
of the industry standard server business, net of related deal and
performance-based costs. The company expects that the net gain will contribute
about 75 cents of earnings per share, which does not reflect the lost profit in
the fourth quarter. While this business was breakeven on an annual basis, the
transactional skew would have driven profit in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, as the company executes some of its plans to drive simplification
and accelerate productivity in the business, it expects to take a workforce
rebalancing charge in the fourth quarter. The company has started to work
through its plans, but, at this point, it expects to take a pre-tax charge of
up to $600 million. Overall, in October, the company disclosed that it is
expecting GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be flat to down
2 percent for the full year compared to 2013, and operating (non-GAAP) earnings
per share, on a continuing operations basis, to be down 2 percent to down 4
percent compared to the prior year. The operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share
expectation exclude acquisition-related charges of $0.73 per share and
non-operating retirement-related costs of $0.27 per share. 
          
       Given the reduced expectation for
earnings, the company expects a considerable impact to free cash flow for the
full year 2014. The industry standard server sale impacts free cash flow in two
items: accounts payable for the balances at the closing, as well as the future
procurement services the company will provide to Lenovo, and, cash tax payments
expected in 2015. The company estimates that this will be a use of cash of
approximately $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter and an additional $0.5 billion
in 2015. Overall, with that impact included, the company expects free cash flow
for the full year 2014 to be between $12-13 billion at the expected level of
income for the year. This does not include the cash from the divestiture, which
will be reported within investing cash flows. 
 
      Looking forward, the company has always
considered a few factors as it looked at its progress toward its 2015 roadmap
earnings per share objective: the trajectory of the business, including the
macro environment; the investments needed to be successful over the longer
term; and, the return of capital to shareholders. Two of these factors have now
changed – the trajectory of the business and the timing of investments that the
company needs to make. It remains a priority to return significant value to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases. Given the company’s third quarter
performance, the actions it is taking and with only 15 months to the end of
2015, the company no longer expects to deliver $20 of operating (non-GAAP)
earnings per share in 2015. Consistent with the company’s practice, it will
provide a view of its expectations for 2015 in January 2015. However, the
company has a clear and compelling strategy – and it is accelerating its
implementation. The company will continue to manage the business for the long
term, and it will continue to return significant value to its shareholders.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       The company expects, in the normal
course of business, that its effective tax rate and operating (non-GAAP) tax
rate related to income from continuing operations will be approximately 21
percent in 2014. The rate will change year to year based on nonrecurring
events, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws and
divestitures, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of
income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
       The company expects 2014 pre-tax
retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.0 billion, a decrease of
approximately $900 million compared to 2013. This estimate reflects current
pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2013. Within total retirement-related
plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be
approximately $1.7 billion, a decrease of approximately $150 million versus
2013. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be
approximately $350 million, a decrease of approximately $700 million compared
to 2013, driven by less recognized actuarial losses. Cash disbursements for all
retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2014,
approximately flat compared to 2013.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At September 30, 2014, currency changes resulted in assets
and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into less dollars
than at year-end 2013. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit
specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears
in the company’s 2013 Annual Report in note D, “Financial Instruments –
Derivative Financial Instruments,” on pages 102 to 106. 


      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency
impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information
does not incorporate any operational actions that management may take in
reaction to fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the
company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first nine
months of 2014. Based on the currency rate movements in the first nine months
of 2014, total revenue decreased 3.2 percent as reported and decreased 2.7
percent at constant currency versus the first nine months of 2013. On a pre-tax
income basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging
activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing
actions) decrease of approximately $75 million in the first nine months of 2014.
The same mathematical exercise resulted in a decrease of approximately $290
million in the first nine months of 2013. The company views these amounts as a
theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering
the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the
nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future
currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be
substantially less than the theoretical maximum
given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
 
      
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
      
The company continues to monitor the economic conditions in Venezuela. On
December 30, 2010, the official rate for essential goods was eliminated, with
no change to the SITME rate. In February 2013, the SITME rate was eliminated,
and the official rate was set at 6.3 bolivars fuerte (BsF) to the U.S. dollar. In March 2013, the Venezuelan government created a new
foreign exchange mechanism called the “Complimentary System of Foreign Currency
Acquirement” (or the “SICAD 1”). This system operates similar to an auction
system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be
used for specific import transactions. In December 2013, the Venezuelan
government published the SICAD 1 rate implied by the 

77



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

transactions
settled in these auctions, and issued Exchange Agreement No. 24 which clarified
the use of the SICAD 1 mechanism. In January 2014, the government issued
Exchange Agreement No. 25, and significantly expanded the transactions that qualify
for use of SICAD 1 and stated that a new agency called the National Center of
Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX) would assume the role of CADIVI, which historically
controlled the sale and purchase of foreign currency in Venezuela. In February
2014, the Venezuelan government signed into law a plan to open a new exchange
control mechanism (“SICAD 2”), and indicated that the official rate of 6.3 BsF
per USD would increasingly be reserved for the settlement of USD denominated
obligations related to purchases of “essential goods and services.” In March
2014, the Venezuelan government published operating rules for SICAD 2 in
Exchange Agreement No. 27. SICAD 2 began operating on March 24, 2014. In March
2014, the company adopted the SICAD 1 rate of 10.7 BsF per USD. The SICAD 1 rate is more representative of the exchange rate
that will be used for the periodic auctions in SICAD
1 for many of the goods and services sold by the company’s Venezuelan
operations. In the first quarter of 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax loss
of $31 million as a result of the devaluation in Other (income) and expense in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At September 30, 2014, the company’s
net asset position in Venezuela was $40 million. The company’s operations in Venezuela comprised
less than 1 percent of total 2013 and 2012 revenue, respectively.
 
       In
January 2014, the Argentinian government devalued its currency from 6
pesos to the U.S. dollar to 8 pesos to the U.S. dollar. This devaluation did
not have a material impact given the size of the company’s operations in
Argentina (less than 1 percent of total 2013 revenue).
  
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2013 Annual Report, on pages 65 to 67,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 65 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
nine months ended, or as of, as applicable, September 30, 2014, those amounts
are $10.8 billion for net cash from operating activities, $9.6 billion of cash
and marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. In October 2014, the term of the five-year global credit facility
was extended by one year, and now expires on November 10, 2019. 
 
      The major rating agencies’ ratings
on the company’s debt securities at September 30, 2014 appear in the table below.
The agency ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2013. The company does
not have “ratings trigger” provisions in its debt covenants or documentation,
which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to
accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The
company’s contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain
standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if
the company’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At September
30, 2014, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position
was $322 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject
to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the
company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no
other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating,
would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

        Free
cash flow of $5,783 million for the first nine months of 2014 decreased $837
million year to year. The decrease was driven primarily by cash tax payments of
$4.6 billion, which were higher year to year $1.5 billion; excluding the impact
of cash tax payments, free cash flow increased approximately $700 million in
the first nine months of 2014. Year-to-date capital expenditures of $2,803
million included investments in SoftLayer of approximately $350 million – a
good example of where the company is shifting spending in the base to strategic
areas. In the first nine months of 2014, the company continued to focus its
cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $3.2 billion in
dividends and $13.5 billion in gross common stock repurchases. 
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2013 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe
downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in note 13, “Contingencies,” in this
Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $600 million in 2014. Cash disbursements related to all
retirement-related plans is expected to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2014.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum
contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent
remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.  
 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity
options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional
funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit
facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany
loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.  
 
        The company does earn a significant amount
of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The company’s policy is to indefinitely
reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and
accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a
portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional
U.S tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any,
associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the
company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign

       The increase in revenue
in the third quarter, as compared to the same period in 2013, was due to:
 
·        
Growth in internal revenue of 16.7
percent, due to increases in used equipment sales revenue (up 19.3 percent to
$492 million) and in financing revenue (up 6.1 percent to $106 million);
partially offset by
 
·        
A decline in external revenue of
3.2 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) due to a decrease in equipment
sales revenue (down 15.9 percent to $109 million), partially offset by an
increase in financing revenue (up 1.3 percent to $377 million).
 
       The increase in revenue
in the first nine months, as compared to the same period in 2013, was due to:
 
·        
Growth in external revenue of 1.0
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) due to an increase in financing
revenue (up 3.3 percent to $1,161 million), partially offset by a decrease in
equipment sales revenue (down 6.2 percent to $340 million); and
 
·        
Growth in internal revenue of 16.7
percent, due to increases in used equipment sales revenue (up 19.9 percent to
$1,586 million) and in financing revenue (up 2.8 percent to $314 million).
 
       The increases in external
financing revenue in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2014,
compared to the same periods in 2013, were due to an increase in the average
asset balance, partially offset by lower asset yields. The increases in internal
financing revenue in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2014,
compared to the same periods in 2013, were due to higher average asset balances.

        
       Global Financing gross
profit increased 7.9 percent and 12.1 percent in the third quarter and for the
first nine months, respectively, of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013,
due to an increase in used equipment sales gross profit, partially offset by a
decrease in financing gross profit. The gross profit margin increased 0.6
points and 1.8 points, in the third quarter and for the first nine months,
respectively, of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, due to a margin
increase in used equipment sales, partially offset by a margin decrease in
financing.
 
       Global Financing
pre-tax income decreased 3.7 percent to $475 million in the third quarter, compared
to the same period in 2013, due to increases in financing receivables
provisions ($53 million) and in selling, general and administrative expenses
($19 million), partially offset by higher gross profit ($52 million). Pre-tax
income increased 5.2 percent to $1,664 million in the first nine months of 2014,
compared to the same period in 2013, due to higher gross profit ($252 million),
partially offset

by increases in financing receivables
provisions ($129 million) and in selling, general and administrative expenses
($43 million). The increases in financing receivables provisions for both
periods were due to higher specific reserve requirements in the current year.
 
      The decrease in return
on equity in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period of 2013,
was due to a higher average equity balance and the decrease in after-tax
income.  The decrease in return on equity in the first nine months of 2014, compared
to the same period of 2013, was due to a higher average equity balance,
partially offset by the increase in after-tax income.

intercompany loans and external debt. A portion of Global Financing debt is in
support  
of the company's internal business or
related to intercompany mark-up embedded in the Global Financing assets. Refer
to the table on page 84 for additional information.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and services, but also
include OEM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients’ total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for systems products, as well as loans
for systems, software and services with terms generally from one to seven
years. Global Financing’s client loans are primarily for software and services
and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the
associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks
in the loan agreements which include covenants to protect against credit
deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client financing also includes
internal activity as described on pages 33 and 34 of the 2013 IBM Annual
Report.
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.

81



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
        In addition to the actions previously described, in
certain circumstances, the company may take mitigation actions to transfer
credit risk to third parties.
 
       At September 30, 2014, substantially all financing
assets are IT related assets, and approximately 58 percent of the total
external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to
consumers.

      Cash
collections of both commercial financing and client financing assets exceeded
new financing originations in the first nine months of 2014 which resulted in a
net decline of financing assets from December 31, 2013. Cash collections of
both commercial financing and client financing assets exceeded new financing
originations in the third quarter of 2014, which resulted in a net decrease in
financing assets in this period. The increase in originations in both periods
was due to improving volumes in commercial financing. Internal loan financing with Global Services is executed
under a loan facility and is not considered originations.
 
      
 Cash generated by Global Financing was
deployed to pay intercompany payables and dividends to IBM as well as business
partners and OEM suppliers.

       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.2 percent at December 31, 2013, to 1.8 percent at
September 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in specific reserve
requirements. Specific reserves increased 51 percent from $279 million at
December 31, 2013, to $423 million at September 30, 2014. Unallocated reserves
decreased 12 percent from $113 million at December 31, 2013, to
$99 million at September 30, 2014, due to the decline in gross financing
receivables.   
 

82



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

       Global Financing’s bad debt expense was $66 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $12 million for the
same period in 2013.  Global Financing’s bad debt expense was $164 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $35 million for the same
period in 2013.  The year-to-year increases in bad debt expense for both
periods were due to higher specific reserve requirements, primarily in China
and Latin America, in the current year. 
  
Residual
Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment
returned at the end of a lease, represented 55.5 percent and 56.6  percent of
Global Financing's revenue in the third quarter and first nine months,
respectively, of 2014, and 53.5 percent and 54.1 percent in the third quarter
and first nine months, respectively, of 2013.  The increases in both periods
were due to a higher volume of used equipment sales for internal transactions.
The gross profit margins on equipment sales were 60.0 percent and 52.8 percent
in the third quarter, respectively, of 2014 and 2013.  The gross profit margins
were 65.2 percent and 57.0 percent in the first nine months of 2014 and 2013,
respectively.  The increases in the gross profit margin for both periods were
driven by a margin increase in internal equipment sales and a shift in mix
toward higher margin internal equipment sales,
partially offset by a margin decrease in external equipment sales.
 
       The
table on page 84 presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value
for sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2014 and
September 30, 2014. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a
percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of when the
unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30,
2014 is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of
the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While
primarily focused on IBM products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM
products. These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments
as provided for by accounting standards in the determination of lease
classifications for the covered equipment and provide protection against risk
of loss arising from declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease
payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a
sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate
asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were
$103 million and $80 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively
and $306 million for both of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2014
and 2013. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of direct
financing leases were $52 million and $55 million for the financing
transactions originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively and $154 million and $170 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed
future values at the scheduled end of lease were $6 million for the
financing transactions originated in both of the quarters ended September 30,
2014 and 2013, and $18 million and $19 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.6
million for both of the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, and $1.8
million and $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

        The company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of
approximately 7 to 1. In the third quarter of 2014, the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates on equity late in the quarter was the primary driver of
the increase in the debt-to-equity ratio versus the company’s target. The debt
used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and
external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to
substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing receivable
and are based on arm's-length pricing. Both assets and debt are presented in
the Global Financing balance sheet on page 81.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s
external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing
Results of Operations” on page 80 and in Segment Information on pages 28 and
29.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of Global Services’
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Financing for the last 2 quarters and 4 quarters, for the three months ended
September 30, and for the nine months ended September 30, respectively.
 
Looking
Forward
 
        Global Financing's
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s
assets and new financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed
to the company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing
assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term
commercial paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A
protracted period where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely
lead to a slowdown in originations.  
 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As previously discussed, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global Financing has policies in
place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies,
combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent
management of the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty
with respect to the global economy.
