NOTE 1: BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
Sono-Tek Corporation (the “Company”, “Sono-Tek”, “We”
or “Our”) is the world leader in the design and manufacture of ultrasonic coating systems for applying precise, thin
film coatings to protect, strengthen or smooth surfaces on parts and components for the microelectronics/electronics, alternative
energy, medical, industrial and emerging research & development/other markets. We design and manufacture custom-engineered
ultrasonic coating systems and also provide patented nozzles and generators for manufacturers’ equipment.
 
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information. Accordingly, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments considered necessary
for a fair presentation (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been included. The results for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of what the results will be for the fiscal year. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended February 28,
2019 (“fiscal year 2019”) contained in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The
Company’s current fiscal year ends on February 29, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”).
 
NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist
of money market mutual funds, short term commercial paper and short-term certificates of deposit with original maturities of 90
days or less.
 
Consolidation - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company, include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sono-Tek Industrial Park, LLC (“SIP”).
SIP operates as a real estate holding company for the Company’s real estate operations.
 
Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock.
 
Equipment, Furnishings and Leasehold Improvements – Equipment,
furnishings and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment and furnishings is computed by use of the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The
Company follows the guidance in the “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Topic” of the Accounting Standards Codification
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. This guidance establishes a common definition for fair
value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The guidance defines fair value
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Additionally, the guidance requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets.
 
Level 2: Observable market-based
inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
 
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which
there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.
 

5 
 

 
The fair values of financial assets
of the Company were determined using the following categories at November 30, 2019 and February 28, 2019, respectively:
 

 
Marketable Securities include mutual
funds, certificates of deposit and US Treasury securities of $3,739,935 and $2,365,706 that are considered to be highly liquid
and easily tradeable as of November 30, 2019, and February 28, 2019, respectively. These securities are valued using inputs observable
in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as Level 1 within the Company’s fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s marketable securities are considered to be available-for-sale investments as defined under ASC 320 “Investments
– Debt and Equity Securities.”
 
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset
and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of "temporary differences"
by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.
 
Intangible Assets - Include costs of patent applications which
are deferred and charged to operations over seventeen years for domestic patents and twelve years for foreign patents. The accumulated
amortization of patents is $168,516 and $160,433 at November 30, 2019 and February 28, 2019, respectively. Annual amortization
expense of such intangible assets is expected to be approximately $11,000 per year for the next five years.
 
Interim Reporting - The attached summary condensed consolidated financial
information does not include all disclosures required to be included in a complete set of financial statements prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Such disclosures were included with the financial
statements of the Company at February 28, 2019, and included in its report on Form 10-K. Such statements should be read in conjunction
with the data herein.
 
The financial information reflects all adjustments, normal and recurring, which,
in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The results for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
year.
 
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for raw materials, subassemblies and work-in-progress and
the specific identification method for finished goods.
 
Land and Buildings – Land and buildings are stated at cost.
Buildings are being depreciated by use of the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of forty years.
 
Long-Lived Assets - The Company periodically evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying
value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable
and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
the fair market value of the long-lived asset. Fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
 
Management Estimates - The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Marketable Securities - The Company adopted ASU 2016-01, “Financial
Instruments – Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” ASU 2016-01 requires
equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of
the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities
to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate
presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates
the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value
that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The Company has evaluated the potential
impact this standard may have on the condensed consolidated financial statements and the fair value allowance of the securities
from the prior year has been reclassified to Retained Earnings from Other Accumulated Comprehensive Income. The unrealized loss
on the marketable securities during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2018 has been disclosed a separate line item
on the Income Statement.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements-
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency
and comparability among organizations by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases
with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either operating or financing, with such classification affecting
the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 had no material impact
on the Company’s financial statements.
 
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive
Income (Topic 220), “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”. ASU
2018-02 was issued to allow the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for the stranded
tax effect resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things,
reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the re-evaluation of any deferred tax assets and liabilities at
the lowered tax rate which potentially could leave a disproportionate tax effect in accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU
2018-02 allows for the election to reclassify these stranded tax effects to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 is effective for all
entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for reporting periods for which financials statements have
not yet been issued. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 had no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
 
Other than Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-02
discussed above, all new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective have been deemed to be not applicable to the Company.
Hence, the adoption of these new accounting pronouncements, once effective, is not expected to have an impact on the Company.
 
Reclassifications – Where appropriate, certain reclassifications
have been made to the prior period to conform to the presentations of the current period.
 
NOTE 3: REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606),
to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International
Financial Reporting Standards. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services
and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for such goods or services.
In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
 
The new revenue standard is principle based and interpretation of those principles
may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances. It is possible that interpretation, industry practice, and
guidance may evolve as companies and the accounting profession work to implement this new standard. The implementation of the standard
did not have a material impact on the financial statements.

A majority of the Company’s sales revenue is derived primarily from
short term contracts with customers, which, on average, are in effect for less than twelve months. Sales revenue from manufactured
equipment transferred at a single point in time accounts for a majority of the Company’s revenue.
 
Sales revenue is recognized when control of the Company’s manufactured equipment
is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive based upon the agreed
transaction price. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied when its customers take control of the purchased equipment,
which is based on the contract terms. Based on prior experience, the Company reasonably estimates its sales returns and warranty
reserves. Sales are presented net of discounts and allowances. Discounts and allowances are determined when a sale is negotiated.
The Company does not grant its customers or independent representatives, the ability to return equipment nor does it grant price
adjustments after a sale is complete.
 
The Company does not capitalize any sales commission costs related to the acquisition
of a contract. All commissions related to a performance obligation that are satisfied at a point in time are expensed when the
customer takes control of the purchased equipment.
 
At November 30, 2019, the Company had received $1,954,000 in cash deposits, and
had issued Letters of Credit in the amount of $659,000 to secure these cash deposits. The Company was utilizing $659,000 of its
available credit line to collateralize these letters of credit. The Company’s inventory included approximately $707,000 directly
related to servicing these customer contracts.
 
NOTE 4: INVENTORIES
 
Inventories consist of the following:
 

 
NOTE 5: STOCK OPTIONS
 
Stock Options – Under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan
("2013 Plan"), options can be granted to officers, directors, consultants and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. Under the 2013 Plan options expire ten years after the date of
grant. As of November 30, 2019, there were 546,667 options outstanding under the 2013 Plan.
 
Under the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended ("2003 Plan"),
until May 2013, options were available to be granted to officers, directors, consultants and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. As of November 30, 2019, there were 50,000 options outstanding
under the 2003 Plan, under which no additional options may be granted.
 
During the nine months ended November 30, 2019, 228,833 options were exercised
on a cashless basis into 126,268 shares of common stock.
 
NOTE 6: STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
 
The Company adopted ASC 718, “Share Based Payments.” which requires
companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards.
 
During the three months ended November 30, 2019, the Company granted options to
acquire 7,500 shares to employees exercisable at $2.10 and options for 100,000 shares to an officer with an exercise price of $2.65.
The options granted to employees vest over three years and expire in ten years. The options granted to the officer vested upon
grant and expire in ten years. All of the options granted by the Company during the three months ended November 30, 2019 had a
combined weighted average grant date fair value of $0.32 per share.
 

8 
 

 
During the nine months ended November 30, 2019, the Company granted options to acquire
17,500 shares to employees exercisable at prices ranging from $2.10 to $2.65, options to acquire 20,000 shares to the non-employee
members of the board of directors with an exercise price of $2.65 and options for 200,000 shares to an officer and director exercisable
at prices of ranging from $2.45 to $2.65. The options granted to employees and directors vest over three years and expire in ten
years. The options granted to the officer vested upon grant and expire in ten years. All of the options granted by the Company
during the nine months ended November 30, 2019 had a combined weighted average grant date fair value of $0.34 per share.
 
The weighted-average fair value of options are estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. The weighted-average Black-Scholes assumptions are as follows:
 

 
In computing the impact, the fair value of each option is estimated on
the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate;
volatility; and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment
awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management
judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company’s stock-based compensation
expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate
and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company’s forfeiture rate, the Company analyzed
its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options, and the number of vested options as a percentage of total
options outstanding. If the Company’s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company
reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what
the Company has recorded in the current period.
 
For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, net income
and earnings per share reflect the actual deduction for stock-based compensation expense. The impact of applying ASC 718 approximated
$38,000 and $7,000 in additional compensation expense during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
impact of applying ASC 718 approximated $82,000 and $23,000 in additional compensation expense during the nine months ended November
30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Such amounts are included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations.
The expense for stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense item.
 
NOTE 7: EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
The denominators for the calculation of diluted earnings per share at November 30,
2019 and 2018 are calculated as follows:
 

 

9 
 

 
NOTE 8: LONG TERM DEBT
 
Long-term debt consists of the following:
 

 
NOTE 9: REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT
 
The Company has a $1,500,000 revolving line of credit at prime which was 4.75% at
November 30, 2019. The revolving credit line is collateralized by the Company’s accounts receivable and inventory. The line
of credit is payable on demand and must be retired for a 30-day period, once annually. If the Company fails to perform the 30-day
annual pay down or if the bank elects to terminate the credit line, the bank may, at its option, convert the outstanding balance
to a 36-month term note with payments including interest in 36 equal installments.
 
As of November 30, 2019, $659,000 of the Company’s credit line was being utilized
to collateralize letters of credit issued to customers that have remitted cash deposits to the Company on existing orders. The
letters of credit expire in 2020. As of November 30, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit and the
unused portion of the credit line was $841,000 as of November 30, 2019.
 
NOTE 10: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Other than the letters of credit disclosed in Note 9, the Company did not have any
material commitments or contingencies as of November 30, 2019.
 
NOTE 11: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
The Company has evaluated subsequent events for disclosure purposes.

ITEM 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We discuss expectations regarding our future performance, such as our business
outlook, in our annual and quarterly reports, news releases, and other written and oral statements. These “forward-looking
statements” are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently
uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations and could
cause actual results to differ materially. These factors include, among other considerations, general economic and business conditions;
political, regulatory, tax, competitive and technological developments affecting our operations or the demand for our products,
including the imposition of tariffs; timely development and market acceptance of new products and continued customer validation
of our coating technologies; adequacy of financing; capacity additions, the ability to enforce patents; maintenance of operating
leverage; maintenance of increased order backlog; consummation of order proposals; completion of large orders on schedule and on
budget; continued sales growth in the medical and alternative energy markets; successful transition from primarily selling ultrasonic
nozzles and components to a more complex business providing complete machine solutions and higher value subsystems; and realization
of quarterly and annual revenues within forecasted range.
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
OVERVIEW
Founded in 1975, Sono-Tek Corporation designs and manufactures ultrasonic
coating systems that apply precise, thin film coatings to a multitude of products for the microelectronics/electronics, alternative
energy, medical and industrial markets, including specialized glass applications in construction and automotive. We also sell our
products to emerging research and development and other markets. We have invested significant resources to enhance our market diversity.
Using our core ultrasonic coating technology, we have increased our portfolio of products, the industries we serve, and the countries
in which we sell our products.
Our ultrasonic nozzle systems use high frequency, ultrasonic vibrations that
atomize liquids into minute drops that can be applied to surfaces at low velocity providing thin layers of protective materials
over a surface such as glass. Our solutions are environmentally-friendly, efficient and highly reliable. They enable dramatic reductions
in overspray, savings in raw material, water and energy usage and provide improved process repeatability, transfer efficiency,
high uniformity and reduced emissions.
We believe product superiority is imperative in all that we produce and that
it is developed through the extensive experience we have in the coatings industry, our proprietary manufacturing know-how and skills
and our unique work force we have built over the years. Our growth strategy is focused on leveraging our innovative technologies,
proprietary know-how, unique talent and experience, and global reach to further develop thin film coating technologies that enable
better outcomes for our customers’ products and processes.
We are a global business with approximately 65% of our sales generated from
outside the United States in the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Our direct sales team and our distributor and sales representative
network are located in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Over the last few years, we have expanded our sales capabilities
by increasing the size of our direct sales force and adding new distributors and sales representatives (“reps”). Of
note, we have implemented demonstration labs in several areas of Asia and Europe, in addition to our headquarters lab in New York,
that are used to train our distributors and reps. These labs are also valuable for demonstrating to prospective customers the capabilities
of our equipment and enable us to develop custom solutions to meet their needs.
Over the last few years, we have shifted our business from primarily selling
our ultrasonic nozzles and components to a more complex business providing complete machine solutions and higher value subsystems
to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). The range for our average unit selling price has broadened as a result
to $50 thousand per unit to over $240 thousand per unit. As a result, we can experience wide variations in both order flow and
shipments from quarter to quarter.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights (compared with
the third quarter of fiscal 2019 unless otherwise noted) We refer to the three-month periods ended November 30, 2019 and 2018
as the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
 


 
•
Net sales were $3,672,000, up 16% or $517,000, primarily driven by increased sales for widetrack integrated coating systems in the float glass market, and increased sales of our SonoBraze product for the manufacturing of heat exchangers and condensers. 

 

11 
 

 


 
•
Gross profit margin was 48.9% compared with 41.1%.  Improvement is
    primarily due to a shift in sales to countries other than China, change in product mix, and increased sales volume of
    integrated coating systems and multi-axis coating systems.

 


 
•
Operating income increased to $270,000, compared with operating income of $50,000. Growth in revenue and gross profit improved operating income during the quarter.

 

Nine Month Fiscal 2020 Highlights (compared with
the first nine months of fiscal 2019 unless otherwise noted) We refer to the nine-month periods ended November 30, 2019 and
2018 as the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
 

 


 
•
Gross profit margin was 47.2% compared with 45.1%.  Improvement is
    primarily due to a shift in sales to countries other than China,  change in product mix, and increased sales volume of
    integrated coating systems and multi-axis coating systems.

 


 
•
Operating income increased to $367,000 compared with $96,000.  Growth in revenue and gross profit were key factors in the improvement of operating income during the quarter.  

 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Sales
 
Product Sales:
 

 
Sales growth was driven by demand for our more complex, highly-engineered and higher
value multi-axis and integrated coating machines, primarily for the Electronics/Microelectronics and Medical markets in the first
nine months of fiscal 2020. This equipment’s average selling price can range from $100 thousand to over $300 thousand per
unit and is typically ordered in one-or two-unit volumes. Growth in these product categories more than offset the decline in OEM
Systems, greatly influenced by our strategy to offer customers full coating solutions at higher price points compared to smaller
revenue OEM packages.
 
Market Sales:
 

 

12 
 

 
Customer use of our application process development laboratories, located throughout
the world, continue to reach record levels in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, which we believe demonstrates the success of
our strategy to provide excellent application engineering expertise as well as paid coating services to prospects and customers
to validate the capabilities of our coating technologies for their uses. These service-based customers are guided by our applications
engineering team, to develop successful coating processes for their unique needs. Upon achieving coating results that meet the
application requirements, the customer's next step is typically to purchase the newly defined coating solution. We believe a high
percentage of prospects and customers that use our lab services to develop their products results in sales of our ultrasonic coating
solutions.
 
We experienced a significant increase in the Electronics/Microelectronics market, primarily as a result of sales to the semiconductor market. Sono-Tek continues to make significant investment in both
personnel and equipment for focused application engineering expertise in this area.
 
The medical market showed an increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 which
was primarily influenced by strong sales of our equipment to be used for stent coating.
 
Geographic Sales:
 

 
In both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020, approximately 65%
of sales originated outside of the United States and Canada compared with 62% in the prior-year fiscal periods. The strong increase
in sales to Latin America was primarily the result of a significant custom designed multi-axis medical device coating system, and
a steady increase of fluxing systems sold into Mexico.
 
Gross Profit:
 

 
Gross profit increased $501,000, or 39%, to $1,797,000 for the third quarter of
fiscal 2020 compared with $1,296,000 in the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 48.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020,
compared with 41.1% in the prior year period.
 
Gross profit increased $737,000, or 19%, to $4,649,000 for the first nine months
of fiscal 2020 compared with $3,912,000 in the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 47.2% for the first nine months of fiscal
2020, compared with 45.1% in the prior year period.
 
The improvement in gross profit margin for the third quarter and the first nine
months of fiscal 2020, is partially due to a shift in sales to countries other than China. In the prior fiscal year, our gross
profit margin was negatively impacted as a result of our pricing strategy to establish a foothold in the fuel cell market in China.
In addition, the shift of sales away from China, has reduced the deep discounts required to sell in China and the avoidance of
tariffs which have had a negative impact on our margins.

In addition, in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020, our gross
profit margins were partially improved due to increased sales of our widetrack systems and medicoat stent coating equipment, both
of these product lines traditionally have had higher profit margins compared to our other products.
 
Operating Expenses:
 

 
Research and Product Development:
For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, research and product development costs increased
primarily due to an increase in research and development materials.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, research and product development
costs increased $41,000 as a result of higher salary expense and related health insurance costs from the addition of personnel
and increased research and development materials expense. These expenses were partially offset by decreases in depreciation and
travel expense.
 
Marketing and Selling:
Higher marketing and selling costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were the
result of increases in salaries and related health insurance premiums, international commission expense and trade show expense.
 
Higher marketing and selling costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 were
due to increased salaries, health insurance premiums and trade show expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases
in travel expense and international distributor training expense.
 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expended approximately $229,000 for
commissions as compared with $116,000 for the prior year fiscal period, an increase of $113,000. For the first nine months of
fiscal 2020, we expended approximately $505,000 for commissions as compared with $325,000 for the prior year fiscal period,
an increase of $180,000. The increase in commission expense, in both periods, is primarily the result of an increase in
international sales being generated by our external distributors. Our external distributors are commissioned at a higher rate
than our in house sales team.
 
General and Administrative:
Higher general and administrative costs in the third quarter and the first nine
months of fiscal 2020 were the result of increases in health insurance premiums, corporate expense and stock-based compensation
expense. These increases were partially offset by lower professional fees, supplies and other miscellaneous expenses.
 
Health Insurance Premiums:
The Company’s health insurance program requires employee contributions. In
the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company’s net health insurance expense was approximately $94,000 as compared with
$88,000 for the prior year fiscal period, an increase of $6,000 or 7%.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, the Company’s net health insurance
expense was approximately $285,000 as compared with $234,000 for the prior year fiscal period, an increase of $51,000 or 22%. The
increase in health insurance expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to the timing of the Company’s
insurance program renewal and eligible employee enrollment.
 
Operating Income:
Our operating income increased $220,000, to $270,000 in the third quarter of fiscal
2020, compared with $50,000 for the prior year period. Growth in revenue and gross profit were key factors in the improvement of
operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating margin for the quarter increased to 7.4% compared with 1.6% in
the prior year period.
 

14 
 

 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, operating income increased $271,000,
to $367,000 compared with $96,000 in the prior year period. Growth in revenue and related growth in gross profit were key
factors in the improvement of operating income in the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Operating margin for the first nine
months of fiscal 2020 increased to 3.7% compared with 1.1% in the prior year period. We continue to invest in research and
product development, as well as marketing and selling activities as well as professional and other staffing to support our
anticipated future market opportunities.
 
Interest Expense:
Interest expense was $8,000 in the third fiscal quarter of 2020 compared with $10,000
for the prior-year period. For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, interest expense was $25,000 compared with $31,000 for the
prior year period. Interest expense is directly related to the mortgage on our industrial park.
 
Interest and Dividend Income:
Interest and dividend income decreased $12,000 to $21,000 in the third quarter of
fiscal 2020 as compared with $33,000 for the prior year period. For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, interest and dividend
income decreased $28,000 to $77,000 as compared with $105,000 in the prior year period. The decrease in interest and dividend income,
in both periods, is due to the reallocation of our investments into US Treasury securities and certificates of deposit.
 
Our present investment policy is to invest excess cash in highly liquid, low
risk US Treasury securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds. At November 30, 2019, the majority of our holdings
are rated at or above investment grade.
 
Net unrealized loss on marketable securities:
The Company adopted ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall: Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. ASU 2016-01 requires
the Company to measure its equity investments at fair value and changes in fair value are to be recognized in net income. Further
information is available in NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES in our financial statements.
 
In the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019, net income and earnings
per share reflect the actual deduction of $59,000 and $189,000, respectively, for the unrealized loss on our marketable securities.
 
In the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2020, there was no unrealized gain or loss recorded
for the Company’s marketable securities. Our present investment
policy is to invest excess cash in highly liquid, low risk US Treasury securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
Unrealized gains or losses, if any, are considered to be immaterial.
 
Other Income:
Included in other income is the net revenue related to the rental of the Company’s
real estate.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company’s rental revenue was $20,000,
expenses were $13,000 and net revenue was $7,000. This compares with the third quarter of fiscal 2019 when rental revenue was $22,000,
expenses were $13,000 and net revenue was $9,000.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, the Company’s rental revenue was
$60,000, expenses were $41,000 and net revenue was $19,000. This compares with the first nine months of fiscal 2019 when rental
revenue was $63,000, expenses were $43,000 and net revenue was $20,000.
 
Income Tax Expense:
We recorded income tax expense of $10,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared
with $3,000 for the prior year period.
 
We recorded income tax expense of $23,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2020
compared with $28,000 for the prior year period.
 
Net Income:
Net income increased by $260,000 to $280,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020
compared with $20,000 for the prior fiscal period.
 
Net income increased by $319,000 to $420,000 for the first nine months of fiscal
2020 compared with $101,000 for the prior year period.

Fiscal Year 2020 Outlook
 
We expect that a significant portion of our backlog of $5,402,000, as of
November 30, 2019, will ship during the fiscal year ending February 29, 2020. However, shipments are dependent upon customer
acceptance test schedules for some of our more complex and customized equipment orders. Based on our existing backlog, we
expect that our current fiscal year sales will grow in the range of 15% to 25%. Furthermore, we expect that this increased
sales volume will expand margins and drive stronger earnings. Part of our anticipated growth is due to a $1,650,000 order for
one of Sono-Tek’s newly developed Robotic Coating Platforms called OMNIbot. OMNIbot is a product line that will allow
us to pursue additional prospects for customers’ six-axis robotic coating needs, which presents an opportunity for
additional growth.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
Working Capital – Our working capital increased $272,000 to
$6,696,000 at November 30, 2019 from $6,424,000 at February 28, 2019. The increase in working capital was mostly the result
of the current period's net income and noncash charges partially offset by purchases of equipment and repayment of long-term debt.
 
The Company aggregates cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in managing
its balance sheet and liquidity. For purposes of the following analysis, the total is referred to as “Cash.” At November
30, 2019 and February 28, 2019, our working capital included:
 

 
The following table summarizes the accounts and the major reasons for the $509,000
increase in “Cash”:
 
 

 
Stockholders’ Equity – Stockholder’s Equity
increased $501,000 to $9,086,000 at November 30, 2019, from $8,585,000 at February 28, 2019. The increase was a result of
the current period’s net income of $420,000 and stock-based compensation expense of $81,000.
 
Operating Activities – We generated $1,023,000
of cash in our operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared with $88,000 in the first nine months of
fiscal 2019. The increase in cash generated by operating activities was mostly the result of increased accounts payable,
accrued expenses, customer deposits and a decrease in accounts receivable. These sources of cash were partially offset by
increased inventories and a decrease in prepaid expenses directly related to inventory.
 
Investing Activities – For the first nine months of
fiscal 2020, cash used by investing activities was $1,766,000 compared with using $361,000 of cash for the first nine months of
fiscal 2019. For the first nine months of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we used $392,000 and $487,000, respectively, for the purchase
or manufacture of equipment, furnishings and leasehold improvements. For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, we used $1,374,000
for the purchase of marketable securities and for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we received $126,000 from the sale of marketable
securities.
 

16 
 

 
Financing Activities – In the first nine months of
fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we used $122,000 and $117,000 in cash, respectively, for the repayment of our note payable.
 
Net (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents – In the first nine
months of fiscal 2020 our cash balance decreased by $865,000 compared with a decrease of $390,000 in the first nine months of fiscal
2019. In the first nine months of fiscal 2020, our operating activities generated $1,023,000 of cash. In addition, we used $392,000
for the purchase or manufacture of equipment, furnishings and leasehold improvements, used $1,374,000 for the purchase of marketable
securities and used $122,000 for the repayment of our note payable.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results
of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
on contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions and conditions.
 
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant
judgments and uncertainties, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
The Company believes that critical accounting policies are limited to those described below. For a detailed discussion on the application
of these and other accounting policies see Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Form 10-K
for the year ended February 28, 2019.
 
Accounting for Income Taxes
As part of the process of preparing the Company’s condensed consolidated financial
statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes. Management judgment is required in determining the provision
for the deferred tax asset.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The computation of the expense associated with stock-based compensation requires
the use of a valuation model. ASC 718 is a complex accounting standard, the application of which requires significant judgment
and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives,
and expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation. The Company currently uses a Black-Scholes option pricing
model to calculate the fair value of its stock options. The Company primarily uses historical data to determine the assumptions
to be used in the Black-Scholes model and has no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ materially from historical
data. However, changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility and future stock award exercise experience could
result in a change in the assumptions used to value awards in the future and may result in a material change to the fair value
calculation of stock-based awards. ASC 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income. Although
every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, significant unanticipated changes in those estimates,
interpretations and assumptions may result in recording stock option expense that may materially impact our financial statements
for each respective reporting period.
 
IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
For information regarding new accounting pronouncements and their effect on the
Company, see “New Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 of the unaudited notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.
 
ITEM 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk
 
The Company does not issue or invest in financial instruments or derivatives for
trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted in the United States, and, as
such, are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk. All of our sales transactions are completed in US dollars.
 
Although the Company's assets included $2,279,000 in cash and $3,740,000 in marketable
securities, the market rate risk associated with changing interest rates in the United States is not material.
 

17 
 

 
ITEM 4 – Controls and Procedures
 
The Company has established and maintains “disclosure controls and
procedures” (as those terms are defined in Rules 13a –15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Christopher L. Coccio, Chief Executive Officer (principal executive) and Stephen J. Bagley,
Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer) of the Company, have evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of November 30, 2019. Based on this evaluation, they have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding timely disclosure.
 
In addition, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls
over financial reporting during the third fiscal quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, internal controls over financial reporting.
