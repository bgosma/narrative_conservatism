STATEMENTS

Note 1.Basis of Presentation

 



The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Good Times Restaurants Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bad Daddy’s International,
LLC (“BDI”), BD of Colorado, LLC (“BD of Colo”), Bad Daddy’s Franchise Development, LLC (“BDFD”),
and Good Times Drive Thru, Inc. (“Drive Thru”), (together referred to as the “Company”, “we”
or “us”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
BD of Colo was formed by Good Times Restaurants
Inc. in 2013 to develop Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants in the state of Colorado. Subsequently, BDI and BDFD were acquired
by Good Times Restaurants Inc. on May 7, 2015. Combined, these entities compose our Bad Daddy’s operating segment, which
as of December 31, 2019, operates thirty-two company-owned and five joint-venture full-service small-box casual dining restaurants
under the name Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar, primarily located in Colorado and in the Southeast region of the United States, franchises
one restaurant in South Carolina, and licenses the Bad Daddy’s brand for use at an airport Bad Daddy’s restaurant under
third-party operations and ownership.
 
Drive Thru commenced operations in 1986
and as of December 31, 2019, operates eighteen Company-owned and seven joint-venture drive-thru fast food hamburger restaurants
under the name Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard, all of which are located in Colorado. In addition, Drive Thru has eight
franchisee-owned restaurants, with six operating in Colorado and two in Wyoming.
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices of the United
States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements contain all of the normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal quarters ended
December 31, 2019 and December 25, 2018. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 29, 2020. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September
24, 2019 is derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles. As a result, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2019.
 
Fiscal Year – The Company’s
fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending on the last Tuesday of September. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company’s
quarterly periods consist of 13 weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the first quarter, making such
quarter consist of 14 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2020 ended on December 31, 2019 and consisted of 14 weeks. The first quarter
of fiscal 2019 ended on December 25, 2018 and consisted of 13 weeks.
 
Advertising Costs – We utilize
Advertising Funds to administer certain advertising programs for both the Bad Daddy’s and Good Times brands that benefit
both us and our franchisees.   We and our franchisees are required to contribute a percentage of gross sales to the fund. 
As the contributions to these funds are designated and segregated for advertising. We consolidate the Advertising Funds into our
financial statements whereby contributions from franchisees, when received, are recorded and included as a component of franchise
revenues.  As we intend to utilize all of the advertising contributions towards advertising expenditures, we recognize costs
equal to franchisee contributions to the advertising funds on a quarterly basis. Contributions to the Advertising Funds from our
franchisees were $58,000 and $67,000 for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and December 25, 2018, respectively.
 
Reclassification – Certain
prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect
on the net loss.
 

Note 2.Updates to Significant Accounting Policies

 
Leases
 
On September 25, 2019, the first day of
fiscal year 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policy for leases. For the
impact of the adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements see Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements and for
additional information about our lease arrangements see Note 11, Leases in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements.
 
The Company determines if a contract contains
a lease at inception. The Company's material long-term operating lease agreements are for the land and buildings for our restaurants
as well as our corporate office. The lease term begins on the date that the Company takes possession under the lease, including
the pre-opening period during construction, when in most cases the Company is not making rent payments (“Rent Holiday”).
 

 7 
Table of Contents 


 
Operating lease assets and liabilities
are recognized at the lease commencement date for material leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Operating lease liabilities
represent the present value of future minimum lease payments. Since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, our operating lease
liabilities are calculated using our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized borrowing over the term of
each individual lease. Minimum lease payments include only fixed lease components of the agreement, as well as variable rate payments
that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date.
 
Operating lease assets represent our right
to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, initial
direct costs and lease incentives. Lease incentives are recognized when earned and reduce our operating lease asset related to
the lease. They are amortized through the operating lease assets as reductions of rent expense over the lease term.
 
Operating lease expense is recognized on
a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of the Company’s operating leases contain clauses that provide for contingent
rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. Variable lease payments that do not depend on
a rate or index, escalation in the index subsequent to the initial measurement, payments associated with non-lease components such
as common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, and short-term lease payments (leases with a term with 12 months or
less) are expensed as incurred or when the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent is considered
probable.
 

Note 3.Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 
Leases
 
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 Leases
(Topic 842) on September 25, 2019, the first day of fiscal year 2020. This update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance
sheet the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of more than twelve months. This update also requires
additional disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This standard is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
 
We elected the optional transition method
option to apply the standard as of the effective date and therefore, we will not apply the standard to the comparative periods
presented in our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this standard had a significant impact on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet as we recognized the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases. The adoption
had an immaterial impact on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, cash flows and overall liquidity.
 
We elected to utilize the three practical
expedients permitted within the standard, which eliminates the requirement to reassess the conclusions about historical lease identifications,
lease classifications, and initial direct costs. We did not elect the hindsight practical expedient, which permits the use of hindsight
when determining lease terms and impairments of right-of-use assets. Additionally, we elected to utilize the short-term lease exception
policy, which allows us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to leases with a term of 12 months or less.
 
The effect of the changes made to the Company's
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 25, 2019 for the adoption of ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) are as follows:
 
(Tabular dollar amounts in thousands)
 

 
The Company reviewed all other recently
issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 4.Revenue

 
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenues consist primarily of sales from
restaurant operations; franchise revenue, which includes franchisee contributions to advertising funds. Revenues associated with
gift card breakage are immaterial to our financials. The Company recognizes revenue, pursuant to the new and updated standards,
when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer, typically a restaurant
customer or a franchisee/licensee.
 
The Company recognizes revenues in the
form of restaurant sales at the time of the sale when payment is made by the customer, as the Company has completed its performance
obligation, namely the provision of food and beverage, and the accompanying customer service, during the customer’s visit
to the restaurant. The Company sells gift cards to customers and recognizes revenue from gift cards primarily in the form of restaurant
revenue. Gift Card breakage, which is recognized when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed is remote, is determined based
upon the Company’s historic redemption patterns, and is immaterial to our overall financial statements.
 
Revenues we receive from our franchise
and license agreements include sales-based royalties, and from our franchise agreements also may include advertising fund contributions,
area development fees, and franchisee fees. We recognize sales-based royalties from franchisees and licensees as the underlying
sales occur. We similarly recognize advertising fund contributions from franchisees as the underlying sales occur. The Company
also provides its franchisees with services associated with opening new restaurants and operating them under franchise and development
agreements in exchange for area development and franchise fees. The Company would capitalize these fees upon receipt from the franchisee
and then would amortize those over the contracted franchise term as the services comprising the performance obligations are satisfied.
We have not received material development or franchise fees in the years presented, and the primary performance obligations under
existing franchise and development agreements have been satisfied prior to the earliest period presented in our financial statements.
 

Note 5.Goodwill and Intangible Assets

 
The following table presents goodwill and
intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 and September 24, 2019 (in thousands):
 

 
The Company had no goodwill impairment
losses in the periods presented in the above table or any prior periods.
 
There were no impairments to intangible
assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The aggregate amortization expense related to these intangible assets subject
to amortization was $10,000 for the quarter December 31, 2019.
 
The estimated aggregate future amortization
expense as of December 31, 2019 is as follows (in thousands):
 

 

Note 6.Common Stock

 
On January 26, 2015, the Company filed
a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which was declared effective
by the SEC on March 25, 2015. The registration statement allows the Company to issue common stock from time to time up to an aggregate
amount of $75 million, of which $22,688,052 has been issued.

Note 7.Stock-Based Compensation

 
The Company has traditionally maintained
incentive compensation plans that include provision for the issuance of equity-based awards. The Company established the 2008 Omnibus
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan in 2008 (the “2008 Plan”) and has outstanding awards that were issued under the
2008 Plan. Subsequently, the 2008 Plan expired in 2018 and the Company established a new plan, the 2018 Omnibus Equity Incentive
Plan (the “2018 Plan”) during the third fiscal quarter of 2018, pursuant to shareholder approval. Future awards will
be issued under the 2018 plan.
 
Stock-based compensation is measured at
the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period
(generally the vesting period of the grant). The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as forfeitures occur.
 
Our net loss for the quarter ended December
31, 2019 and December 25, 2018 includes $75,000 and $112,000, respectively, of compensation costs related to our stock-based compensation
arrangements.
 
Stock Option awards
 
The Company measures the compensation cost
associated with stock option awards by estimating the fair value of the award as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. The Company believes that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate
in calculating the fair values of the Company’s stock options and stock awards granted during the quarter ended December
31, 2019. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the employees
who receive equity awards.
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2019,
there were no incentive stock options granted.
 
During the quarter ended December 25, 2018,
the Company granted a total of 99,832 incentive stock options, from available shares under its 2018 Plan, with exercise prices
between $4.66 and $5.00 and per-share weighted average fair values between $2.68 and $3.16.
 
In addition to the exercise and
grant date prices of the stock option awards, certain weighted average assumptions that were used to estimate the fair value of
stock option grants are listed in the following table:
 

 
We estimate expected volatility based on
historical weekly price changes of our common stock for a period equal to the current expected term of the options. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the United States treasury yields in effect at the time of grant corresponding with the expected term
of the options. The expected option term is the number of years we estimate that options will be outstanding prior to exercise
considering vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns.
 
The following table summarizes stock option
activity for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 under all plans:
 

 
As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate
intrinsic value of the outstanding and exercisable options was $2,000 and $2,000, respectively. Only options whose exercise price
is below the current market price of the underlying stock are included in the intrinsic value calculation.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the total remaining
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was $319,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of approximately 2 years.
 
There were 15,646 stock options exercised
that resulted in an issuance of 2,413 shares during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 with no proceeds in conjunction with the
termination of the Company’s CEO pursuant to a severance and separation agreement. There were 667 stock options exercised
during the quarter ended December 25, 2018 with proceeds of approximately $3,000.

Restricted Stock Units
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2019,
the Company granted a total of 46,336 restricted stock units from available shares under its 2018 Plan. The shares were issued
with a grant date fair market value of $1.54 which is equal to the closing price of the stock on the date of the grant. The restricted
stock units vest three years following the grant date.
 
During the quarter ended December 25, 2018,
the Company granted a total of 79,988 shares of restricted stock from available shares under its 2008 Plan, as amended. The shares
were issued with a grant date fair market value of $3.95 which is equal to the closing price of the stock on the date of the grant.
The restricted stock grant vests over three years following the grant date.
 
A summary of the status of non-vested restricted
stock as of December 31, 2019 is presented below.
 

 
As of December 31, 2019, there was $313,000
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of approximately 1.2 years.
 

Note 8.Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt

 
Cadence Credit Facility
 
The Company maintains a credit agreement
with Cadence Bank (“Cadence”) pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence agreed to loan the Company up to $17,000,000 with
a maturity date of December 31, 2021 (the “Cadence Credit Facility”). On February 21, 2019 the Cadence Credit Facility
was amended, in connection with the RGWP Repurchase (see Note 8 to the financial statements), to retroactively attribute EBITDA
previously attributed to non-controlling interests to the Company for purposes of certain financial covenants. On December 9, 2019
the Cadence Credit Facility was amended in connection with the separation of the Company’s former CEO, to amend the definition
of “Consolidated EBITDA” for the purposes of financial covenants, to require certain installment payments, and to permit
the company to make “Restricted Payments” (as defined in the Cadence Credit Facility). In the form of repurchases or
redemptions of certain equity interests of the Company from former directors and officers of the Company in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $100,000. As amended by the various amendments, the Cadence Credit Facility accrues commitment fees on the daily
unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25%. All borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest
at a variable rate based upon the Company’s election of (i) 2.5% plus the base rate, which is the highest of the (a) Federal
Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Cadence bank publicly-announced prime rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250%
floor, plus 3.5%. Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company selects to pay interest based on the base
rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it selects to pay interest based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average
interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility was 5.275%.
 
The Cadence Credit Facility, as amended,
contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement
of this type, including covenants setting a maximum leverage ratio of 5.35:1, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1 and
minimum liquidity of $2,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Cadence Credit
Facility.
 
As a result of entering into the Cadence
Credit Facility and various amendments, the Company has paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately
$292,000 since the inception of the credit facility and is amortizing these costs over the term of the credit agreement.
 
The obligations under the Cadence Credit
Facility are collateralized by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding
balance on borrowings against the facility was $14,350,000. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced
by the outstanding face value of any letters of credit issued under the facility. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding face
value of such letters of credit was $157,500.
 

 11 
Table of Contents 


 
Principal payments on the Cadence Credit
Facility are required beginning on March 31, 2020 in $250,000 installments on the last business day each of March, June, September,
and December in each calendar year. The total loan commitment is permanently reduced by the corresponding amount of each such repayment
on such date. New borrowings are permitted up to the amount of the loan commitment. The note matures and is due in its entirety
on December 31, 2021.
 

Note 9.Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

 
Our basic earnings per share calculation
is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Our diluted earnings per share calculation is computed
based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been
outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive securities for this calculation consist
of in-the-money outstanding stock options, restricted stock grants and warrants (which were assumed to have been exercised at the
average market price of the common shares during the reporting period). The treasury stock method is used to measure the dilutive
impact of in-the-money stock options. Options and restricted stock units for 804,051 and 900,307 shares of common stock were not
included in computing diluted EPS for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and December 25, 2018, respectively, because their effects
were anti-dilutive.
 

Note 10.Contingent Liabilities and Liquidity

 
We remain contingently liable on various
leases underlying restaurants that were previously sold to franchisees. We have never experienced any losses related to these contingent
lease liabilities, however if a franchisee defaults on the payments under the leases, we would be liable for the lease payments
as the assignor or sub-lessor of the lease. Currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any leases in default by the
franchisees, however there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future which could have a material effect on our future
operating results.
 
Additionally, in the normal course of business,
there may be various claims in process, matters in litigation, and other contingencies brought against the company by employees,
vendors, customers, franchisees, or other parties. Evaluating these contingencies is a complex process that may involve substantial
judgment on the potential outcome of such matters, and the ultimate outcome of such contingencies may differ from our current analysis.
We review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures related to such contingent liabilities in consultation with legal counsel. While
it is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims with certainty, it is management’s opinion that potential losses
associated with such contingencies would be immaterial to our financial statements.
 

Note 11.Leases

 
The Company determines if a contract contains
a lease at inception. The Company's material long-term operating lease agreements are for the land and buildings for our restaurants
as well as our corporate office. The initial lease terms range from 10 years to 20 years, most of which include renewal options
of 10 to 15 years. The lease term is generally the minimum of the noncancelable period or the lease term including renewal options
which are reasonably certain of being exercised up to a term of approximately 20 years.
 
Some of the leases provide for base rent,
plus additional rent based on gross sales, as defined in each lease agreement. The Company is also generally obligated to pay certain
real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges, and various other expenses related to properties, which are expensed
as incurred.

quarter ended December 31, 2019:

As previously disclosed in our 2019 Annual
Report on Form 10-K and under the previous lease accounting, future minimum rent payments for our operating leases for each of
the next five years and in total are as follows as of September 24, 2019:
 

 
The above future minimum rental amounts
exclude the amortization of deferred lease incentives, renewal options that are not reasonably assured of renewal, and contingent
rent. The Company generally has escalating rents over the term of the leases and records rent expense on a straight-line basis.
 

Note 12.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

 
Long-Lived Assets. We review
our long-lived assets including land, property and equipment for impairment when there are factors that indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recovery of assets at the individual restaurant level and typically include
an analysis of historical cash flows, future operating plans, and cash flow projections in assessing whether there are indicators
of impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the net book value of the assets of an individual
restaurant to the fair value of those assets. This impairment process involves significant judgment in the use of estimates and
assumptions pertaining to future projections and operating results.
 
Given the results of our analysis at September
24, 2019, we identified five restaurants where the expected future cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value
of the associated assets.
 
Two of these restaurants are Good Times
restaurants in the greater Denver metropolitan area. We recorded a non-cash charge of $391,000, related to the impairment of these
restaurants in the fiscal quarter ending September 24, 2019. In July of 2019, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for
one of these two restaurants whereby the Company, upon lease commencement subject to due diligence provisions, will receive sublease
income substantially equal to its cash lease costs associated with this location. We continued to operate the restaurant until
December 31, 2019 and the sublease commenced in early February 2020.

Table of Contents 


 
Three of these restaurants are Bad Daddy’s
restaurants, two in the Denver/front-range communities of Colorado and Greenville, South Carolina. We recorded non-cash charges
of $2,380,000 related to the impairment of these restaurants during the fiscal quarter ending September 24, 2019.
 
Trademarks. Trademarks have
been determined to have an indefinite life. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment annually and on an interim basis as events
and circumstances warrant by comparing the fair value of the trademarks with their carrying amount. There was no impairment required
to the acquired trademarks as of December 31, 2019 and December 25, 2018.
 
Goodwill. Goodwill represents
the excess of cost over fair value of the assets of businesses the Company acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather, the
Company is required to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indications of impairment arise. The Company
considers its operations to be comprised of two reporting units: (1) Good Times restaurants and (2) Bad Daddy’s restaurants.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $96,000 of goodwill attributable to the Good Times reporting unit and $15,054,000 of goodwill
attributable to its Bad Daddy’s reporting unit. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized as of December 31, 2019 and
December 25, 2018.
 

Note 13.Income Taxes

 
We account for income taxes using the liability
method, whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated
realizable value. The deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valuation allowances are adjusted as
necessary.
 
The Company has significant net operating
loss carry-forwards from prior years and incurred additional net operating losses during the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and
December 25, 2018. These losses resulted in an increase in the related deferred tax assets; however, full valuation allowances
were made which reduced these deferred tax assets to zero; therefore, no income tax provision or benefit was recognized for the
quarter ended December 31, 2019 and December 25, 2018 resulting in an effective income tax rate of 0% for both periods.
 
The Company is subject to taxation in various
jurisdictions within the U.S. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years
2016 through 2019. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does
not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results
of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company’s
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. No accrual for interest
and penalties was considered necessary as of December 31, 2019.
 

Note 14.Non-controlling Interests

 
Non-controlling interests are presented
as a separate item in the stockholders’ equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The amount of consolidated
net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests is presented on the face of the condensed consolidated statement of
operations. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions,
while changes in ownership interest that do result in deconsolidation of a subsidiary require gain or loss recognition based on
the fair value on the deconsolidation date.
 
The equity interests of the unrelated limited
partners and members are shown on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the stockholders’ equity section as a non-controlling
interest and is adjusted each period to reflect the limited partners’ and members’ share of the net income or loss
as well as any cash contributions or distributions to or from the limited partners and members for the period. The limited partners’
and members’ share of the net income or loss in the subsidiary is shown as non-controlling interest income or expense in
the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated.
 
The following table summarizes the activity
in non-controlling interests during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands):
 

 
Our non-controlling interests consist of
one joint venture partnership involving seven Good Times restaurants and five joint-venture partnerships involving five Bad Daddy’s
restaurants.

Note 15.Segment Reporting

 
All of our Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar
restaurants (Bad Daddy’s) compete in the full-service upscale casual dining industry while our Good Times Burgers and Frozen
Custard restaurants (Good Times) compete in the quick-service drive-through dining industry. We believe that providing this additional
financial information for each of our brands will provide a better understanding of our overall operating results. Income (loss)
from operations represents revenues less restaurant operating costs and expenses, directly allocable general and administrative
expenses, and other restaurant-level expenses directly associated with each brand including depreciation and amortization, pre-opening
costs and losses or gains on disposal of property and equipment. Unallocated corporate capital expenditures are presented below
as reconciling items to the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.
 
The following tables present information about our reportable

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
This Form 10-Q contains or incorporates
by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the disclosure
of risk factors in the Company’s form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2019. Also, documents subsequently filed
by us with the SEC and incorporated herein by reference may contain forward-looking statements. We caution investors that any forward-looking
statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to the following:
 

(I)We compete with numerous well-established competitors who have substantially
greater financial resources and longer operating histories than we do. Competitors have increasingly offered selected food items
and combination meals, including hamburgers, at discounted prices, and continued discounting by competitors may adversely affect
revenues and profitability of Company restaurants.
 

(II)We may be negatively impacted if we experience same store sales declines.
Same store sales comparisons will be dependent, among other things, on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and
existing menu items. No assurances can be given that such advertising and promotions will in fact be successful.
 
We may also be negatively impacted by other
factors common to the restaurant industry such as: changes in consumer tastes away from red meat and fried foods; increases in
the cost of food, paper, labor, health care, workers' compensation or energy; inadequate number of hourly paid employees; and/or
decreases in the availability of affordable capital resources. We caution the reader that such risk factors are not exhaustive,
particularly with respect to future filings. For further discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2019.

Results
of Operations
 
The following presents certain historical
financial information of our operations. This financial information includes results for our quarter ended December 31, 2019 and
December 25, 2018.
 
Net Revenues. Net revenues
for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 increased $5,449,000 or 21.5% to $30,814,000 from $25,365,000 for the quarter ended December
25, 2018. Bad Daddy’s concept revenues increased $4,561,000 while our Good Times concept revenues increased $888,000.
 
Bad Daddy’s restaurant sales increased
$4,563,000 to $22,813,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 from $18,250,000 for the quarter ended December 25, 2018, primarily
attributable to the four new restaurants opened in fiscal 2019 and two new restaurants opened in the quarter ended December 31,
2019, and the impact of the 53rd week of the fiscal year. We estimate the impact of the extra week of sales to be approximately
$2,015,000. Bad Daddy’s same store restaurant sales decreased 3.4% during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to
the same prior-year quarter. Bad Daddy’s restaurants are included in same store sales after they have been open a full eighteen
months. The average menu price increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 over the same prior-year quarter was approximately
2.5%. There were twenty-five restaurants included in the same store sales base at the end of the quarter. Additionally, net revenues
were reduced by $2,000 in lower franchise royalties and license fees compared to the prior-year quarter. Franchise revenues in
the current and prior year quarters each include franchisee advertising contributions of $4,000.

Good Times restaurant sales increased $883,000
to $7,780,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 from $6,897,000 for the quarter ended December 25, 2018. Good Times same
store restaurant sales increased 5.8% during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same prior-year quarter and benefitted
from an extra operating week which we estimate contributed approximately $460,000.The average menu price increase for the quarter
ended December 31, 2019 over the same prior-year quarter was approximately 5.7%. Franchise revenues increased $5,000 for the quarter
ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same prior year period. Franchise revenues for the current and prior year quarters include
franchisee advertising contributions of $55,000 and $63,000, respectively.
 
Restaurant Operating Costs
 
Food and Packaging Costs.
Food and packaging costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 increased $1,509,000 to $9,032,000 (29.5% of restaurant sales)
from $7,523,000 (29.9% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
Bad Daddy’s food and packaging costs
were $6,618,000 (29.0% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, up from $5,269,000 (28.9% of restaurant sales)
for the quarter ended December 25, 2018. This increase is primarily due to a greater number of operating restaurants during the
current quarter versus the same quarter in the prior year. The increase as a percent of sales is due to purchase price increases
in all of our primary proteins, mostly offset by year-over-year increases in menu prices.
 
Good Times food and packaging costs were
$2,414,000 (31.0% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, up from $2,254,000 (32.7% of restaurant sales)
for the quarter ended December 25, 2018. This decrease as a percent of sales is due primarily to the impact of higher menu pricing
and menu engineering, which offset purchase price increases on our primary ingredients.
 
Payroll and Other Employee Benefit
Costs. Payroll and other employee benefit costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 increased $2,266,000 to $11,819,000
(38.6% of restaurant sales) from $9,553,000 (38.0% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
Bad Daddy’s payroll and other employee
benefit costs were $8,841,000 (38.8% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 up from $6,982,000 (38.3% of
restaurant sales) in the same prior year period. The $1,859,000 increase was primarily attributable to the four new restaurants
opened in fiscal 2019 and two new restaurants opened in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. As a percent of sales, payroll and
employee benefits costs increased by 0.5%, as increased wages, particularly for kitchen workers, increased in all states due to
a competitive market for workers, and due to statutory wage increases for front-of-house employees in Colorado, all of which combined
exceeded the impact of our year-over-year menu price increases.
 
Good Times payroll and other employee benefit
costs were $2,978,000 (38.3% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, up from $2,571,000 (37.3% of restaurant
sales) in the same prior-year period. The $407,000 increase was partially attributable to the increase in same store sales as well
as an increase to the average wage paid to our employees. As a percent of sales, payroll and employee benefits costs increased
by 1.0%, primarily related to the average wage paid to our employees, which increased approximately 9.5% in the quarter ended December
31, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. This average wage increase is attributable to a very competitive labor market
in Colorado and statutory increases in the minimum wage rate.
 
Occupancy Costs. Occupancy
costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 increased $473,000 to $2,438,000 (8.0% of restaurant sales) from $1,965,000 (7.8%
of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
Bad Daddy’s occupancy costs were
$1,644,000 (7.2% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 up from $1,277,000 (7.0% of restaurant sales) in
the same prior year period. The $367,000 increase was primarily attributable to the four new restaurants opened in fiscal 2019
and two new restaurants opened in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The increase as a percentage of sales was due to general
increases in our operating lease costs.
 
Good Times occupancy costs were $794,000
(10.2% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, up from $688,000 (10.0% of restaurant sales) in the same prior
year period. The $106,000 increase was primarily attributable to an $84,000 increase in our operating lease costs.
 
Other Operating Costs. Other
operating costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, increased $606,000 to $3,276,000 (10.7% of restaurant sales) from $2,670,000
(10.6% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
Bad Daddy’s other operating costs
were $2,565,000 (11.2% of restaurant sales) for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 up from $2,041,000 (11.2% of restaurant sales)
in the same prior year period. The $524,000 increase was primarily attributable to the four new restaurants opened in fiscal 2019
and two new restaurants opened in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The percentage increase was primarily attributable to approximately
$131,000 of increased commissions paid to delivery service providers in the current year compared to the prior year, offset by
decreases in other general restaurant supplies and expenses.

Table of Contents 

 
Good Times other operating costs were $711,000
(9.1% of restaurant sales) in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, up from $629,000 (9.1% of restaurant sales) in the same prior
year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximate $40,000 increase in commissions paid to delivery service
providers offset by decreases in other general restaurant supplies and expenses.
 
New Store Preopening Costs.
In the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $802,000 of preopening costs compared to $627,000 for the quarter ended December
25, 2018. All of the preopening costs are related to our Bad Daddy’s restaurants.
 
Preopening costs in the current quarter
are primarily attributable to four restaurants: two that opened late during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and two restaurants
that opened during the current quarter. In the prior-year period, pre-opening costs are related to the one Bad Daddy’s restaurant
opened during the first fiscal quarter of 2019, one that opened during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and two that opened during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Preopening costs typically occur over a period of approximately five months. Although the exact
timing varies by location, we typically spend approximately $275,000 to $350,000 per location.
 
Depreciation and Amortization Costs.
Depreciation and amortization costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, increased $45,000 from $1,034,000 in the quarter ended
December 25, 2018 to $1,079,000.
 
Bad Daddy’s depreciation costs increased
$51,000 from $816,000 in the quarter ended December 25, 2018 to $867,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily attributable to the four new restaurants opened in fiscal 2019 and two new restaurants opened in the quarter ended
December 31, 2019, partially offset by the reduced depreciation resulting from asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2019. There were five more Bad Daddy’s restaurants open at the end of the current fiscal quarter compared
to the prior year fiscal quarter.
 
Good Times depreciation costs decreased
$6,000 from $218,000 in the quarter ended December 25, 2018 to $212,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 2019.
 
General and Administrative Costs.
General and administrative costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, increased $239,000 to $2,213,000 (7.2% of total revenue)
from $$1,974,000 (7.8%) of total revenues) for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
The $239,000 increase in general and administrative
expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to:
 

·Increase in training and recruiting costs of $55,000

·Increase in expected employee medical claims costs of $50,000

·Increase in costs associated with district management of $72,000, of which approximately $20,000
is related to the extra operating week in the current quarter and the remainder is primarily related to additional district management
for our east coast Bad Daddy’s markets,

·Increase in professional fees of $139,000

·Decrease of $37,000 in incentive stock compensation costs

·Net decreases in all other expenses of $40,000
 
For the balance of the fiscal year, we
expect general and administrative costs to continue to be stable or decline slightly from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 as we focus
on reducing turnover and associated training costs.
 
Advertising Costs. Advertising
costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, decreased $77,000 to $546,000 (1.8% of total revenue) from $623,000 (2.5% of total
revenue) for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
Bad Daddy’s advertising costs were
$235,000 (1.0% of total revenue) in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to $251,000 (1.4% of total revenue) in the same
prior year period. The $16,000 decrease was primarily attributable to rolling over a media buy in the prior year quarter ending
December 25, 2018 in the Colorado market that was incurred by those restaurants, partially offset by an increase in advertising
fund contributions related to the four new restaurants opened in fiscal 2019 and two new restaurants opened in the quarter ended
December 31, 2019. The current and prior year quarters include advertising costs of $4,000 of costs associated with franchise advertising
contributions.
 
Bad Daddy’s advertising costs consist
primarily of contributions made to the advertising materials fund based on a percentage of restaurant sales as well as local store
marketing efforts.
 
Good Times advertising costs were $311,000
(3.9% of total revenue) in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to $372,000 (5.3% of total revenue) in the same prior year
period. This $61,000 decline is due primarily to reduced contributions made to the regional advertising cooperative. The current
and prior year quarters include advertising costs of $55,000 and $63,000, respectively, of costs associated with franchise advertising
contributions.

Table of Contents 

 
Good Times advertising costs consists primarily
of contributions made to the advertising materials fund and a regional advertising cooperative based on a percentage of restaurant
sales which are used to provide television and radio advertising, social media and on-site and point-of-purchase. The percentage
contribution paid to the regional advertising cooperative was reduced at the start of the current fiscal year associated with a
change in expected media mix. Advertising costs are presented gross, with franchisee contributions to the fund being recognized
as a component of franchise revenues. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect advertising costs to remain relatively stable
at approximately 3.9% of total revenue for the Good Times segment.
 
Franchise Costs. Franchise
costs were $0 and $7,000 for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and December 25, 2018, respectively. The costs are primarily
related to the Good Times franchised restaurants. We currently have minimal direct costs associated with maintaining our franchise
systems as those employees overseeing franchisee relations primarily perform responsibilities associated with company operations
 
Gain on Restaurant Asset Disposals.
The gain on restaurant asset disposals for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 was $19,000 compared to a gain of $30,000 in the
quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
$9,000 of the gain in the current and prior
years is related to deferred gains on previous sale lease-back transactions on two Good Times restaurants. The additional gain
of $10,000 in the current year is related to the sale of miscellaneous restaurant equipment. The additional gain of $21,000 in
the prior year is related to insurance claim reimbursements where assets were destroyed.
 
Loss from Operations. The
loss from operations was $372,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $581,000 in the quarter ended December
25, 2018.
 
The change in the loss from operations
for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 is due primarily due to matters discussed in the "Net Revenues,” "Restaurant
Operating Costs," "General and Administrative Costs," and “Advertising Costs” sections above.
 
Net Loss. The net loss was
$599,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $742,000 in the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
The change from the quarter ended December
31, 2019 to the quarter ended December 25, 2018 was primarily attributable to the matters discussed in the "Net Revenues,"
"Restaurant Operating Costs," "General and Administrative Costs," and “Advertising Costs” sections
above as well as an increase in net interest expense of $67,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same prior
year period.
 
Income Attributable to Non-Controlling
Interests. The non-controlling interest represents the limited partners’ or members’ share of income in the
Good Times and Bad Daddy’s joint-venture restaurants.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2019,
the income attributable to non-controlling interests was $212,000 compared to $309,000 for the quarter ended December 25, 2018.
 
$133,000 of the current quarter’s
income is attributable to the BDI joint-venture restaurants, compared to $250,000 in the same prior year period. This $117,000
decrease is primarily due to the elimination of non-controlling interests beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2019 associated
with the repurchase of interests in the three Raleigh area restaurants. $79,000 of the current quarter’s income is attributable
to the Good Times joint-venture restaurants, compared to $59,000 in the same prior year period.
 
Adjusted EBITDA
 
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income
taxes and depreciation and amortization.
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus
non-cash stock-based compensation expense, preopening expense, non-recurring acquisition costs, GAAP rent in excess of cash rent,
and non-cash disposal of assets. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required
by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and
investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. Our management
uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation
and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.
 
We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the
Company's financial measures with other fast casual restaurants, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.
In addition, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses similar to
those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that
our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable
to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same
fashion.
 


 19 
Table of Contents 

 
Our management does not consider EBITDA
or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation
of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in
the Company's financial statements. Some of these limitations are:
 

·Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements,
for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

·Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our
working capital needs;

·Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements
necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;

·although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements
for such replacements;

·stock based compensation expense is and will remain a key element of our
overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing performance
for a particular period;

·Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting
from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

·other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently
than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
 
Because of these limitations, Adjusted
EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We
compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure.
You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure
to evaluate our business.
 
The following table reconciles net loss
to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) for the fiscal third quarters:
 


 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Cash and Working Capital
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had a working
capital deficit of $7,753,000. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to
customers the same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within a few days of the related sale, and we typically
have two to four weeks to pay our vendors. The working capital deficit may increase when new Bad Daddy’s and Good Times restaurants
are opened. We believe that with our ability to access the Cadence Bank credit facility in addition to cash flow generated from
our existing restaurants, that we will have sufficient capital to meet our working capital, long term debt obligations and recurring
capital expenditure needs in fiscal 2020. As of December 31, 2019, we had no commitments outstanding related to construction contracts
for Bad Daddy’s restaurants currently under development.
 
Consistent with many other restaurant and
retail store operations, we typically use operating lease arrangements for our restaurants. We believe that our operating lease
arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. Effective September 25, 2019,
the first day of fiscal year 2020, our existing lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as operating
lease assets and lease liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, "Leases (Topic
842)". See Note 2, Updates to Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11, Leases, in the notes to our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for more information.

Financing
 
The Company maintains a credit agreement
with Cadence Bank (“Cadence”) pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence agreed to loan the Company up to $17,000,000 with
a maturity date of December 31, 2021 (the “Cadence Credit Facility”). On February 21, 2019 the Cadence Credit Facility
was amended, in connection with the RGWP Repurchase (see Note 8 to the financial statements), to retroactively attribute EBITDA
previously attributed to non-controlling interests to the Company for purposes of certain financial covenants. On December 9, 2019
the Cadence Credit Facility was amended in connection with the separation of the Company’s former CEO, to amend the definition
of “Consolidated EBITDA” for the purposes of financial covenants, to require certain installment payments, and to permit
the company to make “Restricted Payments” (as defined in the Cadence Credit Facility). In the form of repurchases or
redemptions of certain equity interests of the Company from former directors and officers of the Company in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $100,000. As amended by the various amendments, the Cadence Credit Facility accrues commitment fees on the daily
unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25%. All borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest
at a variable rate based upon the Company’s election of (i) 2.5% plus the base rate, which is the highest of the (a) Federal
Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Cadence bank publicly-announced prime rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0%, or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250%
floor, plus 3.5%. Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company selects to pay interest based on the base
rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it selects to pay interest based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average
interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility was 5.275%.
 
The Cadence Credit Facility, as amended,
contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement
of this type, including covenants setting a maximum leverage ratio of 5.35:1, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1 and
minimum liquidity of $2,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Cadence Credit
Facility.
 
As a result of entering into the Cadence
Credit Facility and various amendments, the Company has paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately
$292,000 since the inception of the credit facility and is amortizing these costs over the term of the credit agreement.
 
The obligations under the Cadence Credit
Facility are collateralized by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding
balance on borrowings against the facility was $14,350,000. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced
by the outstanding face value of any letters of credit issued under the facility. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding face
value of such letters of credit was $157,500.
 
Principal payments on the Cadence Credit
Facility are required beginning on March 31, 2020 in $250,000 installments on the last business day each of March, June, September,
and December in each calendar year. The total loan commitment is permanently reduced by the corresponding amount of each such repayment
on such date.  New borrowings are permitted up to the amount of the loan commitment.  The note matures and is due in
its entirety on December 31, 2021.

of fiscal 2020 primarily include normal recurring capital expenditures for existing Good Times and Bad Daddy’s restaurants.

Contingencies
 
We remain contingently liable on various
leases underlying restaurants that were previously sold to franchisees. We have never experienced any losses related to these contingent
lease liabilities, however if a franchisee defaults on the payments under the leases, we would be liable for the lease payments
as the assignor or sublessor of the lease. Currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any leases in default under
which we are contingently liable, however there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future, which could have a material
effect on our future operating results.
 
Additionally, in the normal course of business,
there may be various claims in process, matters in litigation, and other contingencies brought against the company by employees,
vendors, customers, franchisees, or other parties. Evaluating these contingencies is a complex process that may involve substantial
judgment on the potential outcome of such matters, and the ultimate outcome of such contingencies may differ from our current analysis.
We review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures related to such contingent liabilities in consultation with legal counsel. While
it is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims with certainty, it is management’s opinion that potential losses
associated with such contingencies would be immaterial to our financial statements.
 
Impact of Inflation
 
The total menu price increases at our Good
Times restaurants during fiscal 2019 were approximately 4.4%, and we raised menu prices approximately 4.0% during the first quarter
of fiscal 2020. The total menu increases taken at our Bad Daddy’s restaurants during fiscal 2019 were approximately 1.5%
on average. We raised menu prices during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 approximately 2.4%. Commodity prices have increased since
the end of fiscal 2019 and have been elevated in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
When combined with anticipated menu price increases, we expect Good Times’ and Bad Daddy’s’ food and packaging
costs to be relatively consistent or slightly elevated compared with the current quarter, as a percentage of sales during the remainder
of fiscal 2020.
 
Seasonality
 
Revenues of the Company are subject to
seasonal fluctuations based primarily on weather conditions adversely affecting Colorado restaurant sales in December, January,
February and March.
