Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
1. Basis of Presentation:  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto are
unaudited. In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), these statements include all adjustments, which are
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs,
expenses and gains and losses not affecting retained earnings that are reported
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual
results may be different. See the companys 2006 Annual Report for a discussion
of the companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in
this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys 2006 Annual
Report.
 
In the first quarter of
2007, the company changed the presentation of revenue and cost in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings to reflect the categories of Services, Sales
and Financing. Previously, the presentation included Global Services, Hardware,
Software, Global Financing and an Other category. In the past, these categories
were aligned with the companys reportable segment presentation of external
revenue and cost. However, as the company moves toward delivering solutions
which bring integrated software and services capabilities to its clients, the
alignment between segments and categories will diverge. Therefore, there are
situations where the Services segments could include software revenue, and
conversely, the Software segment may have services revenue. The change was made
to avoid possible confusion between the segment revenue and cost presentation
and the required category presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The change only impacts the
format for the presentation of the companys revenue and cost in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings and does not reflect any change in the
companys reportable segment results or in the companys organizational structure.
The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. The
management discussion and analysis of revenue and gross profit from continuing
operations will focus on the segment view, as this is how the business is
managed and is the best reflection of the companys operating results and
strategy.
 
Within the financial tables
in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of
rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated
from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
 
2. Accounting Changes:  In
February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which
will become effective in 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities
to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally
accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is
irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. The
company will adopt this Statement in fiscal year 2008 and does not expect the
adoption of this Statement to have a material effect on the companys
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In September 2006, the FASB
finalized SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which will become effective
in 2008. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements;
however, it does not require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of
SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively to fair value measurements and
disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and is not expected to have
a material effect on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In the first quarter of
2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial
Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, that provides guidance on
accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 156, separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially
measured at fair value, if practicable. Subsequent to initial recognition, the
company may use either the amortization method or the fair value measurement
method to account for servicing assets and servicing liabilities within the
scope of this Statement. The adoption of this Statement did not have a material
effect on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In the first quarter of
2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instrumentsan amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140, which
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid
 
8





 
financial instrument that
contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.  The
adoption of this Statement did not have a material effect on the companys
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. FIN 48
clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law.
This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. See Note 3
below for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the
companys Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
 
3. FIN
48:  As highlighted in Note 2 above, the company
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.
 
The cumulative effect of
adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in tax reserves and an increase of $117 million
to the January 1, 2007 Retained earnings balance. Upon adoption, the liability
for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions at January 1, 2007 was
$2,414 million. This liability can be reduced by $458 million of offsetting tax
benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing
adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. The net amount of
$1,956 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the companys effective
tax rate. In addition, consistent with the provisions of FIN 48, the company
reclassified $1,971 million of income tax liabilities from current to
non-current liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one
year of the balance sheet date. These non-current income tax liabilities are
recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position.
 
Interest and penalties
related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense. The
balance of accrued interest and penalties recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position at January 1, 2007 was $126 million; of this
amount, $95 million was also reclassified from current to non-current liabilities
upon adoption of FIN 48.
 
With limited exception, the
company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2000. During the
first quarter of 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced its audit of
the companys U.S. income tax returns for 2004 and 2005. The company
anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end of 2008. The company
does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits within the next 12 months.
 
For the three month and nine
month periods ending September 30, 2007, there were no material changes related
to tax reserves that impacted the companys effective tax rate.

The reduction in pre-tax
stock-based compensation cost for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2007, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year,
was principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants
($51 million and $91 million, respectively) offset by an increase related to
restricted and performance-based stock units ($16 million and $11 million,
respectively). The effects on stock-based compensation cost related to the
formation of a joint venture based on the companys Printing Systems Division
are included in Other (income) and expense above and in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007.
 
As
of September 30, 2007, the balance of $1,165 million of total unrecognized
compensation costs related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.
 
There were no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at September 30, 2007
and 2006.
 
6. Retirement-Related

In 2007, the
company expects to contribute to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans approximately
$584 million, of which $556 million is the legally mandated minimum
contribution for the companys non-U.S. Plans. In the first nine months of 2007,
the company contributed approximately $383 million to its non-U.S. Plans, as
compared to $1,676 million contributed in the first nine months of 2006.
 
During the
second quarter of 2007, the company initiated changes to the investment
strategy of its U.S. defined benefit plan:
 
                  The 2007 target
asset allocation was modified, primarily by reducing public equity securities and
increasing debt securities from 33 percent to 43 percent of total plan assets;
 
                  Duration of debt
securities was increased; and
 
11





 
                  The use of
derivatives, including interest rate swaps and swaptions, was increased in the
fixed income portfolio to further mitigate the effects of future interest rate
changes on the level of pension surplus.
 
These changes,
which were completed in the third quarter, are designed to reduce the potential
negative impact that equity markets or interest rates might have on the funded
status of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. These changes are not expected
to impact the expected long-term rate of return on assets of 8.0 percent. (See
Note V, Retirement-Related Benefits, pages 107 through 109 in the companys
2006 Annual Report for additional information).

The company received a $23.8
million subsidy in the third quarter of 2007 and $38.4 million for the first nine
months of 2007 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by the company
to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the remainder is
contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the participants. For
further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 110
in the companys 2006 Annual Report.
 
In addition, the company
made a $500 million voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. nonpension
postretirement plan in March of 2007. This advance funding was in addition to
ongoing contributions of approximately $400 million that will be made in 2007
which will be utilized to pay current year benefits. The $500 million
contribution will be used to fund benefit payments in future years.
 
7. Accelerated Share
Repurchase:  In May 2007, IBM International Group, a
wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the company (the Foreign Subsidiary)
repurchased 118.8 million shares of common stock for $12.5 billion under
accelerated share repurchase agreements with three banks (the Accelerated
Repurchase).
 
Pursuant to the Accelerated
Repurchase agreements, executed on May 25, 2007, the Foreign Subsidiary paid an
initial purchase price of $105.18 per share for the repurchase. The initial
purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the volume weighted average
price of IBM common stock over a settlement period of three months for each of
the banks. The adjustment will also reflect certain other amounts including the
banks carrying costs, compensation for ordinary dividends declared by the
company during the settlement period and interest benefits for receiving the
$12.5 billion payment in advance of the anticipated purchases by each bank of
shares in the open market during its settlement period. The adjustment amount
can be settled in cash, registered shares or unregistered shares at the Foreign
Subsidiarys option. Under the Accelerated Repurchase, the Foreign Subsidiary
will have a separate settlement with each of the three banks. The first
settlement occurred on September 6, 2007, resulting in a settlement payment to
the bank of $151.8 million. The amount was paid in cash at the election of the
Foreign Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the Accelerated
Repurchase and was recorded as an adjustment to Stockholders equity in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on the settlement date.
 
12





 
The
remaining two settlements are expected to occur in December 2007 and March 2008,
and any amounts to be paid or received by
the Foreign Subsidiary under any of the settlement alternatives in connection
with the price adjustment will be recorded as an adjustment to Stockholders
equity in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on each of the
settlement dates.
 
The
estimated fair value of the cash settlement and share settlement alternatives
under the Accelerated Repurchase as of September 30, 2007 would result in the
payment of approximately $764 million or 6.7 million registered shares, or 6.8
million unregistered shares respectively, by the Foreign Subsidiary. In
comparison, each $1 increase in the volume weighted average share price would
increase these estimates by approximately $79.2 million or approximately 0.7
million registered and unregistered shares under the cash settlement and share
settlement alternatives, respectively. The Foreign Subsidiary cannot be
required to deliver more than 238 million shares if it elects the share
settlement options for the two remaining settlements, regardless of the volume
weighted average share price.
 
8. Acquisitions:  During
the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the company completed eight
acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $838 million. The closing of the Telelogic
AB acquisition, announced in the second quarter, is conditioned upon
satisfactory completion of regulatory reviews in the European Union. Regulatory
reviews in the U.S. have been completed.
 
The
Software segment completed six acquisitions: in the first quarter, Consul Risk
Management International BV and Vallent Corporation, both privately held
companies. Four acquisitions were completed in the third quarter: Watchfire
Corporation, WebDialogs Inc. and Princeton Softech Inc., all privately held
companies, and DataMirror Corporation, a publicly held company. Each
acquisition further complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of
product offerings.
 
Global
Technology Services (GTS) completed two acquisitions in the first quarter:
Softek Storage Solutions Corporation (Softek) and DM Information Systems, Ltd.
(DMIS), both privately held companies. Softek augments the companys unified
data mobility offerings and worldwide delivery expertise for managing data in
storage array, host and virtualized IT environments. DMIS will enhance and
complement the companys Technology Service offerings.
 
Purchase
price consideration was paid in cash. These acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
The
table below reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the
resulting purchase price allocations as of September 30, 2007.

The acquisitions were
accounted for as purchase transactions, and accordingly, the assets and
liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that generated the
goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired companies and IBM
and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify as an
amortizable intangible asset. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax
purposes. The overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable
intangible assets acquired is 4.5 years. With the exception of goodwill, these
identified intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives.
Goodwill of $700 million was assigned to the Software ($636 million) and Global
Technology Services ($64 million) segments.

9. Printing
Systems Divestiture:  In January 2007, the company announced an
agreement with Ricoh Company Limited (Ricoh), a publicly traded company, to
form a joint venture company based on IBMs Printing System Division (a
division of the Systems and Technology segment). See Note X, Subsequent Events
in the companys 2006 Annual Report.
 
The
company initially created a wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoPrint Solutions
Company, LLC (InfoPrint), by contributing specific assets and liabilities from
its printer business. The companys Printing System Division generated
approximately $1 billion of revenue in 2006. The InfoPrint portfolio includes
solutions for production printing for enterprises and commercial printers as
well as solutions for office workgroup environments and industrial segments. On
June 1, 2007 (closing date), the company divested 51 percent of its interest
in InfoPrint to Ricoh. The company will divest its remaining 49 percent
ownership to Ricoh quarterly over the next three years from the closing date.
At September 30, 2007, the companys ownership in InfoPrint is 44.9 percent.
 
The
total consideration the company agreed to on January 24, 2007 (the date the
definitive agreement was signed) was $725 million which was paid in cash to the
company on the closing date. The cash received was consideration for the
initial 51 percent acquisition of InfoPrint by Ricoh as well as a prepayment
for the remaining 49 percent to be acquired and certain royalties and services
to be provided by the company to InfoPrint. Final consideration for this
transaction will be determined at the end of the three-year period based upon
the participation in the profits and losses recorded by the equity partners. The
company evaluated its ownership and participation in InfoPrint under the
requirements of FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The
company concluded that InfoPrint meets the requirements of a variable interest
entity, the company is not the primary beneficiary of the entity and that
deconsolidation of the applicable net assets was appropriate. The companys
investment in InfoPrint will be accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.
 
The
company will provide maintenance services for one year, certain hardware
products for three years and other information technology and business process
services to InfoPrint for up to five years. The company assessed the fair value
of these arrangements, and, as a result, deferred $274 million of the proceeds.
This amount will be recorded as revenue, primarily in the companys services
segments, as services are provided to InfoPrint.
 
The
royalty agreements are related to the use of certain of the companys
trademarks for up to ten years. The company assessed the fair value of these
royalty agreements, and, as a result, deferred $116 million of the proceeds. This
amount will be recognized as Intellectual property and custom development
income as it is earned in subsequent periods.
 
Net
assets contributed, transaction related expenses and provisions were $90
million, resulting in an expected total pre-tax gain of $245 million, of which
$81 million was recorded in Other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings in the second quarter of 2007.
 
The
deferred pre-tax gain of $164 million was primarily related to: (1) the
transfer of the companys remaining 49 percent interest in InfoPrint to Ricoh,
and, (2) the transfer of certain maintenance services employees to InfoPrint. The
company will recognize this amount over a three year period as the remaining
ownership interest is divested and the employees are transferred. The pre-tax
gain will be recorded in Other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.

(a)  Other intangibles are primarily acquired
proprietary and non-proprietary business processes, methodologies and systems.
 
The net
carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $40 million during the first nine
months of 2007 primarily due to the amortization of existing intangible asset
balances, partially offset by net increases in software capitalization and
acquired  intangible assets. The
aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $295 million and $875
million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively,
versus $259 million and $790 million for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2006, respectively. In addition, in the first nine months of 2007,
the company retired $797 million of fully amortized intangible assets,
impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this
amount.
 
The
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to
intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position is estimated to be the following at September 30, 2007:
 




2007 (for Q4)

11. Segments:  The tables on pages 57 and 58 of this Form
10-Q reflect the results of the companys reportable segments consistent with
the management system used by the companys chief operating decision maker.
These results are not necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
For example, employee retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial
assumptions on a country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments based
on headcount. A different result could occur for any segment if actuarial
assumptions unique to each segment were used. Performance measurement is based
on income before income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in
part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating
resources to, each of the segments.

The other adjustments column in the table above principally includes the
reclassification of non-current to current and foreign currency translation
adjustments. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007,
net adjustments were recorded to (1) increase  previously recorded liabilities for actions
taken prior to 1994 ($7.8 million); (2) reduce previously recorded liabilities
for actions taken in the second quarter of 2005 ($3.1 million), second-quarter
2002 ($1.1 million) and fourth-quarter 2002 ($0.5 million). Of the net increase
of $3.1 million, $4.6 million was included in Selling, general and administrative
expense and a $1.5 million reduction was recorded in Other (income) and
expense. In addition, interest expense (accretion) of $22.4 million was
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense and $3.1 million was
recorded in Other (income) and expense.

13. Contingencies:  The
company is involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations and
proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its
business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property
(IP), product liability, employment, benefits, securities, and environmental
matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties,
including competitors, partners, clients, current or former employees,
government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the
locations in which the company does business. The following is a summary of
some of the more significant legal matters involving the company.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in
Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and focus
the issues in the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for summary
judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its
decision. On August 10, 2007, the court in another suit, The SCO Group, Inc. v.
Novell, Inc., issued a decision and order determining, among other things, that
Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights, and obligating SCO to
recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of
UNIX license agreements. At the request of the court in SCO v. IBM, on August
31, 2007, each of the parties filed a status report with the court concerning
the effect of the August 10th Novell ruling on the SCO v. IBM case, including
the pending motions. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy
protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed.
 
In
May 2005, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the companys motion to review and
reverse a Louisiana state courts certification of a nationwide class in a case
filed against the company in 1995. The class consists of certain former
employees who left the company in 1992, and their spouses, claiming damages
based on the companys termination of an education assistance program. On July
3, 2007, the company and the plaintiffs filed a proposed class settlement
agreement with the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, where the legal action was filed. On October 1, 2007, the
Court gave its final approval of the proposed settlement pursuant to which IBM
will pay certain amounts to eligible individuals who took or would have taken
an education course within a specified period after departing the company. As
part of the settlement, IBM will also make contributions to support engineering
education for women and minorities. Class members have until mid-December 2007
to file an appeal of the Courts order approving the settlement.
 
In
July 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York related to the companys disclosures concerning
first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity compensation. Pursuant
to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006, the two lawsuits were
consolidated into a single action captioned In re International Business
Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs filed a corrected
consolidated amended complaint dated May 19, 2006, in which they named the
company and IBMs Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as
defendants and alleged that defendants made certain misrepresentations and
omissions in violation of Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 20, 2006, the Court
denied a Motion to Dismiss that was filed by IBM. On March 12, 2007, the plaintiffs
class was certified; class notifications were mailed on or about May 30, 2007.
 
In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea announced it
had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several companies, including
IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and LG Electronics,
which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and had also charged
employees of some of those entities with, among other things, bribery of
certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea and bid rigging.
IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in these matters. A
number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM employees, were
subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM were also
required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different times,
covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance, which
barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter.
 
On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc.
(PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. IBM filed its amended complaint on August 17, 2007 and asserted claims
for patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, copyright infringement,
tortious interference and breach of contract in
 
17





 
connection
with PSIs development and marketing of a computer system that PSI says is
compatible with IBMs S/390 and System z architectures. IBM also sought a
declaratory judgment that its refusal to license its patents to PSI and certain
of its software for use on PSI systems does not violate the antitrust laws. IBM
seeks damages and injunctive relief. On September 21, 2007, PSI answered the
amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against IBM for alleged
monopolization and attempted monopolization, tying, violations of New York and
California statutes proscribing unfair competition, tortious interference with
the acquisition of PSI by a third party and promissory estoppel. PSI also
sought declaratory judgments of noninfringement of IBMs patents and patent
invalidity. Discovery is proceeding and the court has ordered that the case be
ready for trial in the Fall of 2008.
 
In
October 2003, a purported collective action lawsuit was filed against IBM in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by ten
former IBM employees alleging, on behalf of themselves and allegedly similarly
situated former employees, that the company engaged in a pattern and practice
of discriminating against employees on the basis of age when it terminated
employees, both in connection with reductions in force and individualized
determinations. Initially, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit on the
basis of release agreements signed by all the plaintiffs. On appeal, the Ninth
Circuit reversed the trial courts finding that the release barred these
claims, and in January 2007, after denial of IBMs petition for rehearing, the
matter was returned to the trial court for further proceedings. On October 3,
2007, the court dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs claim for relief under the
Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and dismissed with leave to amend
plaintiffs claim asserting disparate impact age discrimination with respect to
individualized terminations.
 
The
company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought in Tokyo District Court by
Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover losses that it allegedly
suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy)
proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo Leasing amounts for
which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others liable. The claims in this
suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the
importation of computer software. The total amounts related to these matters
are approximately $2  billion, including
amounts currently in litigation and other amounts. In addition, the company has
received an income tax assessment from Mexican authorities relating to the
deductibility of certain warranty payments. In response, the company has filed
an appeal in the Mexican Federal Fiscal court. The total potential amount
related to this matter for all applicable years is approximately $500 million. The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that these amounts are
not meaningful indicators of liability.
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5), the
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are
reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the
impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other
information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities for the
above items, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended
September 30, 2007, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Based on its experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed
in the matters referred to above are not a meaningful indicator of the
potential liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are
inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of
the matters previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend
itself vigorously in all such matters, it is possible that the companys
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these
matters.
 
Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any
 
18





 
such
remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies
may have on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique
facts and circumstances of the particular matter which may give rise to
additional factors.
 
14. Commitments:    The companys extended lines of credit
include unused amounts of $4,358 million and $2,895 million at September
30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. A portion of these amounts was
available to the companys business partners to support their working capital
needs. In addition, the company committed to provide future financing to its
customers in connection with customer purchase agreements for approximately $2,919
million and $2,496 million at September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
respectively.
 
The company
has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee or
indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5 by requiring a guarantor to
disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the
guarantors performance is remote. The following is a description of
arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
The company is
a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to
indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these
obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company,
under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against
losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such
matters as title to the assets sold, certain IP rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making an adverse claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically
allow the company to challenge the other partys claims. Further, the companys
obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or
amount, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third
parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It is not
possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these
or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a
material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In addition,
the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum
potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $30 million and
$32 million at September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

The decrease
in the warranty liability balance was primarily driven by a reduction in
estimated future costs as a result of the divestiture of the companys Personal
Computing business to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) in April 2005.
 
15. Subsequent
Events:  On
October 22, 2007, IBM International Group Capital LLC, an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, issued $1.5 billion of 5-year term
notes. The proceeds from this debt issue will be utilized to reduce the 364-day
floating rate term loan associated with the second-quarter accelerated share
repurchase. (See Note 7 on pages 12 and 13 for additional information).
 
On October 30,
2007, the company announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly
dividend of $0.40 per common share. The dividend is payable December 10, 2007
to shareholders of record on November 9, 2007.

The following Results of
  Continuing Operations discussion does not include the hard disk drive (HDD)
  business that the company sold to Hitachi, Ltd. on December 31, 2002. The HDD
  business was accounted for as a discontinued operation under generally
  accepted accounting principles. There was a $1 million loss from Discontinued
  Operations in the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 versus no gain
  or loss in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006.

3.0 percent adjusted for
  currency



 
Within the
Management Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at
constant currency are made so that the financial results can be viewed without
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby
facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the companys business performance.
 
In the third
quarter, total revenue increased 6.6 percent as reported, 3.0 percent adjusted
for currency, versus the third quarter of 2006. Pre-tax income from continuing
operations was $3,280 million, up 3.3 percent compared to the prior year. Diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.68 in the quarter, an
increase of 15.9 percent year-to-year.
 
As the quarter
developed, the company took actions to effectively manage its business in an
uncertain economic environment, including a disciplined focus on spending and
productivity, while maintaining investments in high growth areas.
 
The third
quarter financial results were driven by strong revenue growth in Global
Services. Total revenue growth in the services businesses was 13.8 percent, the
best overall growth rate in four years. These results reflect the actions that the
company has been taking to accelerate its services revenue growth, while continuing
to improve profitability. Global Business Services increased 15.9 percent and
Global Technology Services grew 12.8 percent versus the prior year.
 
Software segment
revenue increased 6.5 percent year-to-year. Performance was good in small and
medium-sized transactions ($1 million or less), however, clients deferred
several large deals late in the quarter. The Systems and Technology business
was impacted by product transitions and a difficult year-to-year compare in System
z. Revenue decreased 10.4 percent, 6.0 percent excluding the divested printing
business (see Note 9 on page 14). Global Financing revenue increased 6.1
percent driven by improved used equipment sales.
 
Geographic results
were balanced led by Asia Pacific which grew 9.4 percent (6 percent adjusted
for currency); Europe grew 11.3 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) and
Americas had revenue growth of 3.8 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency).
In addition, the company continued to benefit from its investments and strong
growth in its emerging country
 
20





 
markets where
revenue grew 19.3 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency). Revenue growth by
industry sector was mixed with strong growth in Public, up 11.2 percent (8
percent adjusted for currency) and Communications, up 10.4 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency). The Financial Services sector, the largest of the
companys industry sectors, was weaker, growing 5.4 percent (1 percent adjusted
for currency) driven by the U.S.
 
The gross
profit margin was 41.3 percent in the third quarter versus 42.0 percent in the third
quarter of 2006. The decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily driven
by a mix shift among the segments and a lower margin in the Software business. Global
Financings margin declined 4.0 points primarily due to used equipment sales
margins.
 
Total expense
and other income increased over the year-earlier period by 5.7 percent. The rate
of growth declined from prior periods. The increase was primarily due to
continuing investments in acquisitions, currency impacts and interest expense which
was driven by the debt related to the accelerated share repurchase in the
second quarter. The ratio of Total expense to revenue decreased 0.3 points to 27.7
percent for the third quarter versus the comparable period of 2006.
 
The effective
tax rate for the third quarter of 2007 was 28.0 percent versus 30.0 percent in
the third quarter of 2006.
 
Cash flow from
operating activities was $4,484 million, an increase of $476 million versus the
third quarter of 2006 and an improvement of $1,040 million compared to the second
quarter of 2007.
 
Total Global
Services signings were $11.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007 as compared
to $10.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The estimated
total Global Services backlog was $116 billion at September 30, 2007, flat
versus June 30, 2007 and an increase of $7 billion versus September 30, 2006.

**     4.2 percent adjusted for currency
 
For the first nine months of
2007, total revenue increased 7.3 percent as reported, 4.2 percent adjusted for
currency, versus the prior year. Pre-tax income from continuing operations was
$9,001 million, a 5.9 percent increase compared to the first nine months of
2006. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.42,
reflecting a 16.0 percent improvement year-to-year. In the second
quarter, the company executed a $12.5 billion accelerated share repurchase,
and, in total, repurchased approximately nine percent of the common shares
outstanding at March 31, 2007.
 
Revenue performance in the
first nine months was led by both Global Services businesses and Software.
Geographically, Asia Pacific had the strongest performance, with improvement in
Europe as well. Performance in the emerging country markets remains very
strong, with revenue growth of 24.9 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first nine months of 2007 versus the first nine months of 2006.
 
21





 
The gross profit margin for
the first nine months of 2007 was 41.1 percent, an improvement of 0.3 points
versus the prior year. The continued focus on productivity initiatives in Global
Services, combined with an improved hardware margin, has led to the overall
margin improvement.
 
Total expense and other
income increased 9.2 percent in the first nine months of 2007. This increase
was primarily driven by the continuing investments to drive future business
growth and develop higher value capabilities. In addition, interest expense
increased $189 million primarily driven by the debt related to the
accelerated share repurchase.
 
The effective tax rate for
the first nine months of 2007 was 28.2 percent versus 30.0 percent for the
comparable period in 2006.
 
For the first nine months of
2007, cash flow from operating activities was $10,943 million, an increase of $1,259
million versus the first nine months of 2006.
 
Assets increased $5,375 million
from December 31, 2006 to September 30, 2007 primarily due to the effects of
currency (approximately $3,400 million). Cash and cash equivalents and
Marketable securities increased $3,166 million, Prepaid pension assets
increased $1,277 million, Investments and sundry assets increased $626 million,
prepaid expenses increased $601 million, Goodwill increased $989 million and Plant,
rental machines and other property  net increased $397 million during the
first nine months of 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decline
in short-term financing receivables of $1,566 million and a decline of $603 million
in accounts receivable during the first nine months of 2007.
 
Liabilities increased $13,335
million from December 31, 2006 driven by an increase in short- and long-term
debt, primarily related to the accelerated share repurchase.
 
Stockholders equity declined
$7,960 million in the first nine months of 2007 primarily due to the companys
common stock repurchases, including the accelerated share repurchase
transaction, partially offset by an increase in Retained earnings of $4,866
million and an increase in Common stock of $3,434 million.

The companys two services segments, Global Technology Services and
Global Business Services, had combined revenue of $13.7 billion, an increase of
13.8 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and $39.2
billion, an increase of 10.5 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first nine months of 2007, respectively, when compared to same periods of 2006.
The company has made considerable progress implementing its strategies across
the global services offerings. The actions taken have resulted in strong and
balanced contribution across all geographies, industry segments and business
lines.
 
Global
Technology Services (GTS) revenue increased 12.8 percent (9 percent adjusted
for currency) and 10.0 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively, versus the third quarter
and first nine months of 2006. GTS delivered double-digit revenue growth across
all geographies, business lines and sectors. Total signings in GTS increased 12
percent in the third quarter of 2007, with longer term signings increasing 19
percent while shorter term signings decreased 3 percent.
 
Strategic
Outsourcing (SO) revenue was up 10.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency)
in the third quarter and 8.0 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first nine months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006.
Revenue growth was driven by a combination of good signings performance over
the past twelve months, continued lower base erosion and sales of new business
into existing accounts. SO signings in the third quarter of 2007 increased 46
percent when compared to the third quarter of 2006.
 
Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue was up 26.7 percent (22 percent
adjusted for currency) year to year. For the first nine months of 2007, BTO
revenue increased 13.4 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) versus the
first nine months of 2006. Third quarter BTO signings declined 66 percent year
to year. Signings in this business can be inconsistent period to period.
 
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 14.9 percent (11 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter and 14.0 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first nine months of 2007 when compared to the same periods in
2006. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased signings in 2006 and the
first half of 2007 as well as contribution from the acquisition of Internet
Security Systems (ISS). ITS signings in the quarter decreased 3 percent year to
year.
 
Maintenance
revenue increased 13.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) and 9.7
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in the prior year. The  maintenance business continues to benefit
from providing availability services on non-IBM IT equipment. Services provided
to InfoPrint Solutions drove 7 points of the revenue growth in the quarter and
3 points of growth for the first nine months. See note 9 on page 14 for
additional information on this services agreement.
 
24





 
Global
Business Services (GBS) revenue increased 15.9 percent (12 percent adjusted for
currency) and 11.6 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively, versus the year ago
periods. Revenue increased in all geographies and sectors, with the strongest growth
in Communications, Distribution, Public and Small and Medium Businesses. From
an offering perspective, Financial Management Services, Human Capital
Management and Supply Chain were the strongest. In addition, good progress has
been made in the Application Management Business and the company continues to
have success building out its global capabilities. Total signings in GBS
increased 13 percent in the third quarter of 2007. Longer term signings
increased 80 percent while shorter term signings decreased 6 percent. Although
down this quarter, shorter term signings have increased 6 percent over the
trailing twelve months.

Technology Services gross profit increased 14.1 percent in the third quarter
and 10.4 percent in the first nine months of 2007 compared to the same periods
of 2006, with gross profit margins improving 0.3 points and 0.1 points,
respectively. The GTS segment pre-tax margin was 10.8 percent in the third
quarter of 2007, an improvement of 1.2 points versus third-quarter 2006 and 2.2
points from the second quarter of 2007. The margin improvement is driven
primarily by the benefits from restructuring, productivity improvements and
revenue growth. The segment pre-tax margin for the first nine months of 2007
decreased 0.6 points year to year to 9.1 percent, reflecting increased
investments in sales and delivery, the impact of acquisitions and restructuring
costs.
 
Transformation
actions taken in Global Business Services over the past two years have resulted
in profitable growth. GBS gross profit increased 16.2 percent to $1.1 billion
for the third quarter and 17.1 percent to $3.1 billion for the first nine
months of 2007 versus the same periods of 2006. Gross profit margins improved
0.1 points and 1.1 points year to year in the third quarter and first nine
months, respectively. Segment pre-tax margin was 10.7 percent in the third
quarter and 10.5 percent in the first nine months of 2007, an improvement of
1.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively, versus the prior year periods. This is
the ninth consecutive quarter of pre-tax margin improvement in GBS. The margin expansion
has been driven primarily by revenue growth, on-going productivity and
utilization initiatives and good expense management.

Global
Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients
commitment under a Global Services contract. Signings are used by management to
assess period performance of Global Services management. There are no
third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management is an approximation of constant currency,
and involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients
commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence
of termination charges or wind-down costs. For example, for longer term
contracts that require significant upfront investment by the company, the
portions of these contracts that are a signing are those periods in which there
is a significant economic impact on the client if the commitment is not
achieved, usually through a termination charge or the client incurring
significant wind-down costs as a result of the termination. For shorter term
contracts that do not require significant upfront investments, a signing is
usually equal to the full contract value. Longer term contracts represent SO
and BTO contracts as well as GBS contracts with the U.S. Federal government and
its agencies and Application Management Services (AMS) for custom and legacy
applications. Shorter term contracts represent the remaining GBS offerings of
Consulting and Systems Integration, AMS
for packaged applications and ITS contracts. These amounts have been
adjusted to exclude the impact of year to year currency changes.
 
Signings
include SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions and increases in
scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value.
Maintenance is not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be
more steady-state, where revenues equal renewals, and therefore, the company
does not think they are as useful a predictor of future performance.
 
Backlog
includes SO, BTO, ITS, GBS, and Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a
statement of overall work under contract and therefore does include
Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by
several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts,
periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and currency
assumptions used to approximate constant currency.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincident to an acquisition or divestiture.

Systems
and Technology revenue decreased 10.4 percent (13 percent adjusted for
currency) and 2.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in
2006. On June 1, 2007, the company completed the divestiture of its printing
business. This results in the loss of approximately $250 million of Systems and
Technology revenue per quarter. See Note 9 on page 14 for additional
information regarding this divestiture. Systems and Technology revenue,
excluding the printing business, declined 6.0 percent in the third quarter and was
essentially flat in the first nine months of 2007.
 
System
z revenue decreased 31.1 percent and 8.7 percent (34 percent and
12 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2007 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2006,
respectively. System z MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments decreased
21 percent in the third quarter while increasing 7 percent for the first nine
months of 2007 versus the comparable periods of 2006. The System z revenue decline
in the quarter was against a particularly strong third quarter 2006 revenue
growth of 25 percent; in addition, a number of large deals did not close in
September. The company has had a long and successful technology cycle in System
z, with eight consecutive quarters of MIPS growth prior to this quarter, and
continues to work with its clients to help them manage their computing
requirements and provide them attractive migration offerings to transition to
the next generation products.
 
System i revenue decreased 20.7 percent and 16.6 percent (23 percent
and 19 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2007 versus the same periods in 2006. The company introduced
POWER6 technology on the high-end platform late in the third quarter of 2007.

revenue increased 6.0 percent and 8.4 percent (3 percent and 6 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2007
versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, respectively, primarily
driven by strength in mid-range POWER6 servers, which increased 28 percent and
9 percent in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively. This
was the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth for System p, with
particular strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific. The POWER6 microprocessor
more than doubles the clock speed versus the previous generation. It also provides
leading edge energy management and enhanced virtualization capabilities.
 
27





 
System x revenue increased 4.9 percent
and 8.2 percent (1 percent and 5 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007 versus the third quarter and first nine
months of 2006. Revenue performance was driven by System x server products
which grew 6 percent and 9 percent in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2007. In addition, System x blades revenue grew 8 percent in both the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2007. The new x86 servers with quad-core
processors and BladeCenter S for the SMB market are scheduled for fourth
quarter availability.
 
System
Storage revenue increased 1.3 percent and 2.2 percent (declined 2 percent
and 1 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2007 versus the comparable periods in 2006. The increases were driven by
growth in tape products (7 percent in third quarter and 9 percent in the first nine
months of 2007), while external disk products declined 3 percent for the third
quarter of 2007 and 2 percent in the first nine months of 2007.
 
Microelectronics
revenue decreased 15.0 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively, for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007 versus the comparable periods of 2006,
driven by reduced demand for game processors. The company is pursuing
opportunities in other high growth segments, including wired and wireless
communications.
 
Retail Store
Solutions revenue increased 29.2 percent and 18.5 percent (26 percent and 15
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2007 versus the same periods in 2006, primarily due to the continued roll out of
new programmable point-of-sale solutions to large retail clients.

The decrease in gross profit
for the third quarter of 2007 versus the same period of 2006 was primarily due
to the decrease in revenue in System z. The increase in gross profit for the
first nine months of 2007 versus the first nine months of 2006 was primarily
due to improved margins in System z and revenue growth and improved margins in System
p.
 
Overall, gross margin in the
third quarter increased 0.3 points versus the prior year. System p performance
contributed 1.3 points to the overall margin improvement. Margins also improved
in System z, System x and Retail Store Solutions in the third quarter versus
the prior year. These improvements were offset by lower margins in System
Storage and System i which impacted the overall margin by 0.5 points and 0.3
points, respectively. In the first nine months of 2007, gross margin increased 1.2
points compared to the first nine months of 2006. System p and System z
contributed 1.1 points and 0.9 points, respectively, to this improvement,
driven primarily by margin improvements. This was offset by lower margins in
System Storage, System i and System x which impacted the overall margin by 0.5
points, 0.3 points and 0.2 points, respectively.
 
Systems and Technologys
pre-tax margin decreased 0.2 points and increased 1.5 points in the third
quarter and first nine months, respectively, versus the prior year periods.

Software
segment revenue increased 6.5 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) and 9.3
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006. In the third
quarter, the company had good performance in small (under $500 thousand) and
medium ($500 thousand to $1 million) sized transactions, but overall revenue
growth was impacted by a number of large transactions that clients deferred
late in the quarter. Revenue growth was driven by Key Branded Middleware.
 
Key
Branded Middleware grew 8.0 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter of 2007 and 15.5 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first nine months of 2007, when compared to the same periods in 2006. The
company continues to invest in its Key Branded Middleware products and expects
the majority of its software revenue growth to come from this portion of the
software portfolio.
 
Revenue
from the WebSphere family of products increased 10.3 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency) and 17.0 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency) in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, respectively. The WebSphere

Management revenue increased 9.4 percent and 16.3 percent (5 percent and 12
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2007, respectively, versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2006.
Information Management software is increasingly important in todays digital
world. With the growth in Web-based applications, the ability to collect,
analyze and act on data is critical to the success of the companys clients. In
the third quarter, the company completed the acquisitions of DataMirror
Corporation and Princeton Softech Inc. These acquisitions will enhance the
companys Information on Demand initiative, which is aimed at the growing
market opportunity around helping clients use information as a competitive and
strategic business asset.

(6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2007, respectively, versus the same periods in 2006. Third-quarter revenue performance
was led by double-digit growth in the Lotus Notes Domino product family. Lotus
software is well established as a tool for providing improved workplace

Revenue increased in all
geographies in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2007 when
compared to the same periods in 2006. Adjusted for currency, growth was led by strong
performance in Asia Pacific in both periods.
 
Americas revenue increased 3.8
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) in the quarter. Revenue increased in
the U.S. 2.9 percent, Canada increased 11.6 percent (4 percent adjusted for
currency) and Latin America increased 0.9 percent (decreased 6 percent adjusted
for currency). Double digit revenue growth in the Public sector was partially
offset by decreased revenue in the Financial Services and Communications
sectors.
 
Europe/Middle East/Africa
(EMEA) revenue increased 11.3 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter of 2007 when compared to the third quarter of 2006. In the major
countries, Germany increased 14.7 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency),
Spain increased 14.1 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), the U.K.
increased 10.2 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency), France increased 9.8
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and Italy increased 3.6 percent
(decreased 4 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Asia Pacific revenue
increased 9.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of
2007 versus the third quarter of 2006. The company is capitalizing on a strong
economy and received solid contributions from the India, ASEAN, China and
Australia/New Zealand regions. Japan revenue decreased 0.6 percent (flat
adjusted for currency) with growth in services and software being offset by a decline
in revenue from systems.
 
Across the geographies, the
emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 19.3
percent (10 percent adjusted for currency). These emerging countries are
leading the growth in the global economies and the company has been investing
to capture this growth. Russia increased 21.4 percent (21 percent adjusted for
currency), India increased 47.7 percent (30 percent adjusted for currency) and
China increased 25.2 percent (21 percent adjusted for currency). The rate of
revenue growth in Brazil slowed to 3.1 percent (decreased 9 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter of 2007 versus a strong prior year
performance.
 
31





 
OEM revenue decreased 12.0
percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2007 when
compared to the third quarter of 2006, driven by game processors in the
Microelectronics business.
 
Americas
revenue for the first nine months of 2007 was $29.4 billion, an increase of 3.8
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) when compared to the same period of
2006. The U.S. increased 3.1 percent, Canada increased 4.6 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) and Latin America increased 7.7 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency).
 
EMEA
revenue was $23.9 billion, up 12.7 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first nine months of 2007 versus the same period in 2006. Revenue increased
in all major countries with Spain up 18.7 percent (10 percent adjusted for
currency), Germany 16.3 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency), the UK 12.4
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency), France 8.2 percent (flat adjusted
for currency) and Italy 7.1 percent (decreased 1 percent adjusted for
currency).
 
Asia
Pacific revenue increased 9.6 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) to
$14.0 billion in the first nine months of 2007 when compared to the first nine
months of 2006. Revenue, adjusted for currency, increased in all geographic
regions and was led by performance in Australia/New Zealand, ASEAN and the
emerging markets of China and India. Japan revenue decreased 0.8 percent as
reported but increased 2 percent when adjusted for currency.
 
Revenue
in the key emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew
24.9 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of
2007 versus the first nine months of 2006. Brazil revenue increased 12.7
percent (3 percent adjusted for currency), Russia 25.1 percent (25 percent
adjusted for currency), India 39.2 percent (29 percent adjusted for currency)
and China 30.8 percent (27 percent adjusted for currency).
 
OEM
revenue decreased 9.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
nine months of 2007 on a year to year basis as demand for game processors has
moderated versus prior year levels.
 
Expense
 
The
Total expense and other income to revenue ratio was 27.7 percent and 28.3
percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 versus 27.9 percent
and 27.8 percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006,
respectively. The decrease in the third quarter ratio was due to expense
growing slightly less than revenue in the quarter. The expense growth rate
improved in the third quarter versus prior periods as a result of the companys
actions to manage spending in the current environment. Total expense and other
income increased 5.7 percent and 9.2 percent in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2007, respectively, versus the same periods of 2006. The company is
continuing to make changes to the mix of its business, investing in higher
value capabilities, including strategic acquisitions, while divesting of
commoditizing businesses. This has contributed to higher gross margins, which have
increased over five points from 2002 to 2006. These higher value businesses
also require higher operating expenses reflecting the ongoing investment
required to develop and sell higher value capabilities. For additional
information regarding Total expense and other income, see the following

Total Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased
4.0 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) and 9.6 percent
(7 percent adjusted for currency), respectively, in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2007 versus the same periods in 2006. The third quarter
2007 increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by acquisitions (4
points) and the effects of currency (3 points). These increases were partially
offset by lower spending due to expense management actions focused on
productivity from sales teams, as well as support functions, and tightly
managed discretionary spending.
 
For the first nine months of 2007 versus the first nine months of 2006,
currency drove approximately 3 points of the increase in SG&A expense, acquisitions
related spending drove approximately 5 points and 2 points of growth was driven
by investments in the software and services businesses as well as emerging
markets. This reflects the continuing business mix shift to higher value
businesses which require higher operating expenses. The returns on these
investments are reflected in the momentum in key branded middleware offerings,
growth in emerging markets and improved Global Services signings. In addition,
Workforce reductionsongoing increased as the company addressed cost issues in
the Global Technology Services business, primarily in Strategic Outsourcing,
during the second quarter of 2007.

Other (income) and expense was income of $95 million in the third
quarter 2007 versus income of $174 million in the third quarter of 2006. The
company hedges its major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of
currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging
programs is primarily reflected in Other (income) and expense, as well as cost
of goods sold. This quarter, losses from derivatives resulted in $127 million
of year-to-year impact to Other (income) and expense. This decline was
partially offset by higher gains from foreign currency transactions in the
third quarter of 2007 versus third quarter of 2006.
 
The decline in Other (income) and expense for the first nine months of
2007 versus the first nine months of 2006 was primarily driven by the increase
in expense associated with hedging programs, partially offset by higher gains
from foreign currency transactions, the gain from the divestiture of the
printing business to Ricoh in the second-quarter 2007 (see Note 9 on page 14
for additional information) and sales of Lenovo stock in the first and second
quarter of 2007. As a result of the sale of Lenovo stock, the companys
ownership in Lenovo declined from 11.3 percent to 8.8 percent, with voting
ownership at 4.8 percent.

The decrease for the third quarter of 2007 versus the third quarter of
2006 was due to decreased spending in Systems & Technology ($63 million),
partially offset by increased spending in Software ($70 million) primarily
resulting from acquisitions. The increase for the first nine months of 2007
versus the first nine months of 2006 was due to increased spending in Software
($276 million) resulting from acquisitions, partially offset by lower spending
in Systems & Technology ($134 million) and other units ($96 million).

The increase in Interest

periods of 2006 was primarily due to the increase in debt to finance the
companys accelerated share repurchase agreements. See Note 7 on pages 12 and
13 for additional information regarding this transaction.
 
Interest expense is also presented as part of Cost of Financing in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related external borrowings are

approximately $332 million and $311 million associated with its
defined benefit pension plans for the third quarter of 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The comparable amount for the first nine months of 2007 and 2006
was costs of approximately $967 million and $985 million, respectively.
The cost of defined contribution plans increased approximately $38 million and
$107 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 versus the same
periods of 2006. The third quarter 2007 year-to-year increase approximately

Provision for
Income Taxes
 
The effective tax rates for the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 were
28.0 percent and 30.0 percent, respectively. The corresponding effective tax
rates for the first nine months of 2007 and 2006 were 28.2 percent and 30.0
percent, respectively. The decline in the rate was due to a more
favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, reinstatement of the U.S. research
tax credit passed by Congress in December 2006 and the second-quarter gain
associated with sale of the printing business.
 
With
limited exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
local or non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through
2000. The years subsequent to 2000 contain matters that could be subject to
differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates
to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax
returns for 2004 and 2005 in the first quarter of 2007. The company anticipates
that this audit will be completed by the end of 2008.
 
Earnings Per
Share
 
Basic
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common
shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards and convertible notes.

The weighted average number of common shares outstanding assuming
dilution during the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 was
128.5 million and 97.4 million lower than the same periods in 2006
primarily as a result of the companys common share repurchase program.
 
Results

There was a $1 million loss from Discontinued Operations in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2007 versus no loss in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2006.
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
The
assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant
part of IBMs financial position. Accordingly, although the financial
position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the companys consolidated
amounts including Global Financing, to the extent the Global Financing business
is a major driver of the Consolidated Financial Position, reference in the
narrative section will be made to a separate Global Financing
section in this Management Discussion on pages 45 to 50. The amounts
appearing in the separate Global Financing section are supplementary data
presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.
 
In the second
quarter, the company repurchased $14.6 billion of its outstanding common stock,
of which $2.1 billion was executed in open market transactions and the
remainder of $12.5 billion was repurchased through accelerated share repurchase
(ASR) agreements. Under the agreements, which were executed on May 25, 2007,
the company repurchased 118.8 million shares from three banks for an initial
price of $105.18 per share. The banks are expected to purchase an equivalent
number of shares in the open market during the next nine months. As discussed
in Note 7 on pages 12 and 13, the initial price of the ASR is subject to an
adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of the shares during this
period and this adjustment will be recorded in Stockholders equity in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on each of the settlement dates.
The first settlement occurred on September 6, 2007, resulting in a settlement
payment of $151.8 million.
 
The ASR transaction was guaranteed by the company and
was executed through IBM International Group (IIG), a wholly-owned, foreign
subsidiary of IBM. The formation of IIG enabled the company to create a
centralized foreign holding subsidiary to own most of its non-U.S. operations.
IIG funded the repurchases with $1 billion in cash and an $11.5 billion,
364-day floating rate term loan with a number of financial institutions. The
term loan was guaranteed by the company and carries an interest rate of the
LIBOR plus 10 basis points. Principal and interest on the loan will be paid by
IIG with cash generated by its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries. The execution
of the ASR enabled the company to achieve a substantial share reduction, a
lower cost of capital and an effective use of non-U.S. cash. Over time, the
companys cost of capital will vary with market conditions.
 
In the third quarter, IIG paid off approximately $500
million of the term loan associated with the ASR, and refinanced $4.6 billion
with $2.6 billion in long-term debt and $2.0 billion in commercial paper. In
addition, the company issued $3.0 billion in 10 year bonds.
 
As a result of these actions, the companys working
capital and current ratio (highlighted below) improved from June 30, 2007. At
June 30th, working capital was negative and the current ratio was
0.88 as a result of the ASR term loan which is classified as Short-term debt in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Current
assets increased $1,928 million due to:
 
                  An increase of $3,166 million in Cash and
cash equivalents and Marketable securities (see cash flow analysis on pages 39
and 40); and
 
                  An increase of $600 million in Prepaid
expenses and other current assets, primarily driven by Taxes ($193 million) and
deferred service arrangement transition costs ($114 million); partially offset
by
 
                  A decline of $2,047 million in short-term
receivables driven by decreases of $1,566 million in financing receivables and
$603 million in trade receivables due to collections of seasonally higher
year-end balances.
 
Current
liabilities increased $4,920 million as a result of:
 
                  An increase of $7,645 million in Short-term
debt driven by the 364-day term loan utilized to finance the accelerated share
repurchase agreements in the second quarter of 2007;
 
                  An increase of $842 million in Other current
accruals primarily resulting from an increase in derivative liabilities due to
changes in foreign currency rates; partially offset by
 
                  A decrease of $2,107 million in Taxes payable
primarily due to the adoption of FIN 48; consistent with the provisions of FIN
48, $2,066 million of income tax liabilities was reclassified from current to
non-current liabilities because payment is not anticipated within one year of
the balance sheet date; the balance of the reduction was related to payments in
the first nine months of 2007; and
 
                  A decrease of $1,231 million in Accounts
payable and a decrease of $201 million in Compensation and benefits, primarily
resulting from declines in balances from typically higher year-end levels.

Net
cash from operating activities increased $1,259 million compared to the first nine
months of 2006 driven by the following key factors:
 
                  Lower retirement-related plan funding of $793
million ($1,676 million funding of non-U.S. plans in 2006 versus $883 million
in 2007: $500 million in the U.S. for retiree medical and $383 million funding
for non-U.S. plans);
 
                  Increase in cash from deferred income ($620 million)
primarily driven by Global Technology Services, which includes approximately
$300 million as prepayment for future services related to the divestiture of
the printing business;
 
                  Increase in net income of $515 million; and
 
39





 
                  Lower restructuring payments of $198 million;
partially offset by
 
                  Decrease in cash driven by accounts payable
of $756 million mainly resulting from lower volumes in the first nine months of
2007.
 
Net
cash used in investing activities declined $142 million driven by:
 
                  An increase of $310 million in divestitures
driven by the divestiture of the printing business (see Note 9 on page 14 for
additional information); and
 
                  A decrease of $164 million in acquisitions; partially
offset by
 
                  An increase of $178 million in net capital
spending due to;
 
 $102 million increase in Plant, rental
machines and other property primarily driven by Global Technology Services, and
 
 $84 million increase in Investment in
software primarily due to increased capitalized software development.
 
                  An increase of $153 million in net purchases
of marketable securities and other investments mainly due to increased net purchases
from short-term marketable securities.
 
Net
cash used in financing activities decreased $3,782 million as a result of:
 
                  Increase of $13,185 million in net cash
proceeds from debt; and
 
                  Increase due to higher common stock
transactions  other ($2,629 million) primarily driven by stock option
exercises, partially offset by
 
                  Higher common stock repurchases ($11,669
million); and
 
                  Higher dividend payments ($362 million).

and
 
                  Increase of $625 million ($258 million due to

an increase of;
 
 $253 million in
deferred transition costs driven by an increase in long-term services
arrangements with clients; and

payable of $2,066 million resulting from the implementation of FIN 48 on
January 1, 2007. At this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably
reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual fiscal years beyond
12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes;
 
                  Growth of $478 million in non-current
deferred income primarily driven by Global Technology Services; and
 
                  Increase of $320 million in long-term
derivative liabilities due to changes in foreign currency rates.
 
Debt
 
The
companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are
executed to manage the companys overall asset and liability profile.
Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global
funding sources as needed.

* Non-Global Financing debt
is the companys total external debt less the Global Financing debt described
in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 46.
 
Non-Global
Financing debt increased $11,113 million and the debt-to-capitalization ratio
increased to 40.3 percent, primarily due to the financing of the companys accelerated
share repurchase agreements in the second quarter of 2007; non-Global Financing
debt decreased $268 million in the third quarter, and the
debt-to-capitalization ratio improved 6.4 points compared to the second quarter.
 
Equity
 
Stockholders
equity decreased $7,960 million primarily as a result of a decrease related to
net stock transactions of $14,214 million, driven by common stock repurchases
which resulted in an increase in Treasury stock at September 30, 2007.
 
This
reduction was offset by:
 
                  An increase of $4,866 million in retained
earnings primarily driven by net income of $6,466 million and the $117 million
cumulative catch adjustment to the retained earnings opening balance related to
the implementation of FIN 48, partially offset by dividends ($1,593 million);
and
 
                  An increase of $1,388 million in Accumulated
gains and (losses) not affecting retained earnings primarily resulting from the
amortization in the first nine months of 2007 of unrecognized pension costs ($722
million).

Looking Forward
 
The
following key drivers impacting IBMs business are described in more detail in
the 2006 IBM Annual Report on page 21.
 
        Economic environment and corporate spending
budgets
        Internal business transformation and global
integration initiatives
        Innovation initiatives
        Open standards
        Investing in growth opportunities
 
The
company has a significant global presence, operating in 170 countries, with more
than 60 percent of its revenue generated outside the U.S. In addition,
approximately 65 percent of the companys employees are located outside the
United States, including about 30 percent in Asia Pacific. This global reach
gives the company access to markets, with local management teams who understand
the clients and their challenges and who can respond to these opportunities
with value-add solutions. The companys broad mix of hardware, software and
services businesses provide a strong and balanced operational base for the
company.
 
The companys long-term
financial model objective is to generate 10 to 12 percent earnings per share
growth over the long term through a combination of revenue growth, margin
improvement and effective capital deployment to fund growth and provide returns
to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. In May, the
company met with investors and analysts and discussed a roadmap to deliver
earnings per share in 2010 in the range of $9  11 per share, or 10 to 16
percent compound growth from 2006. This included additional earnings growth
potential from a number of sources including growth initiatives, acquisitions
and the current projected impact of retirement related cost over this period.
 
The companys
performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 highlighted the
benefits of its global reach and the strength of its business model. The
financial results reflected solid progress on major elements of the long term
goals, however, the company measures the success of its business model over the
long term, not any individual quarter or year. The companys strategies,
investments and actions are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term
performance.
 
The
company will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions to expand its
capabilities. The company has a targeted acquisition strategy and has developed
the ability to efficiently acquire, integrate and accelerate new product and
service offerings. In addition, the company will continue to evaluate
underperforming and less strategic areas of its portfolio. The company also
continues to invest in emerging countries, to capture growth in these markets
and to gain access to their skill base to deliver global solutions.
 
Within
Software, the company expects its Key Branded Middleware products to benefit
from continued development and sales investments in key product technologies
such as SOA and Information on Demand. In addition, targeted acquisitions will
continue to broaden the companys software capabilities. Growth in Software
provides the company with a source of high margin revenue growth, and the
company expects its Software business to contribute a larger portion of the
companys profit over the next few years.
 
In
the third quarter, the companys Global Services businesses delivered strong results
reflecting the progress of the broad based improvements that have been
implemented over the past few years. Within Global Technology Services, the ITS
portfolio has been rebalanced, driving improved revenue performance, and the SO
business has been strengthened resulting in signings growth, lower levels of
erosion and growth from existing clients. Pre-tax profit margins have also
improved. Within Global Business Services, overall operations have been
transformed with a focus on improved profitability and growth  results have
been demonstrated through improvements in utilization, better contract quality
and increased profit margins. The overall Global Services business is
well-positioned going forward.
 
In
the Systems and Technology business, the company will focus its investments on
differentiating technologies with high-growth potential including POWER6,
blades, high-performance computing and energy efficiency. The transition to
POWER6 technology, which began with System p mid-range products in the second
quarter, continued with implementation on the System i platform in the third
quarter. System z is well into a very successful product cycle. Clients are
continuing to consolidate and virtualize their workloads and this trend is
positive for demand for the companys high-end servers. In the
 
42





 
fourth quarter, the company
will have new System x products available and will continue to work with System
z clients on migration offerings to new technology. As discussed in Note 9 on
page 14, the company has divested its printing business in a transaction with
Ricoh. Going forward, this divestiture results in the loss of approximately
$250 million of revenue per quarter in the Systems and Technology business.
 
Total expense and other income increased 9.2 percent
in the nine months of 2007. The growth rate moderated to 5.7 percent in the
third quarter due to focused actions the company implemented to manage expense.
The company will maintain this focus in the fourth quarter.
 
Total retirement-related
plan cost increased $93 million in the first nine months of 2007, as compared
with the first nine months of 2006, as discussed on page 36. For the full
year, the company estimates pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to increase
approximately $125 to $150 million when compared to 2006 versus its prior
estimate of approximately $100 million increase. The change in estimate is
primarily driven by currency impacts. This expected year-to-year change is
primarily driven by an increase in the cost of defined contribution plans. The
cost of defined benefit plans is estimated to be essentially flat year to year
as increases due to changes in the actuarial assumptions (used to determine
2007 expense) will be offset by expected savings due to better-than-expected
2006 return on asset performance.
 
The company expects
stock-based compensation expense to decline in 2007 when compared with 2006.
The anticipated decline is expected to be approximately $100 million on a
pre-tax basis. The companys prior estimate for this decline was less than $100
million.
 
The company expects that its
effective tax rate in 2007 will be approximately 28.2 percent. The rate will
change period-to-period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlements
of income tax audits, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix
of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
In 2006 and 2005, the
companys cash tax rate was approximately 16 percent.
 
The companys cash tax rate
represents the amount of income taxes paid during the year over Income from
continuing operations before income taxes. The company anticipates that its
cash tax rate will increase in the near term as the company has now fully
utilized its U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At September 30, 2007, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at
year-end 2006. The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to
limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in the 2006 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 83 to 86.
 
In the first nine months of
2007, the company earned approximately half of its pre-tax income from
continuing operations in countries other than the U.S. The company also
maintains hedging programs to limit the volatility of currency impacts on its
financial results. These hedging programs limit the impact of currency changes
on the companys financial results but do not eliminate them. In addition to
the translation of earnings and the companys hedging programs, the impact of
currency changes also may affect pricing and sourcing actions. For example, the
company may procure components and supplies in multiple functional currencies
and sell products and services in other currencies. Therefore, it is
impractical to quantify the impact of currency on these transactions and on
consolidated net income. Generally, the company believes that extended periods
of dollar weakness are positive for net income and extended periods of dollar
strength are negative, although the precise impact is difficult to assess.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking
prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into foreign
currency hedge contracts.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
On
pages 43 and 44 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report there is a discussion of the
companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. One
table, on page 43, includes each of the past five years of the companys
Net cash from operating activities, Cash and marketable securities and the size
of the companys global credit facilities. For the nine months ended or as of,
as applicable, September 30, 2007, those amounts are $10.9 billion, $13.8 billion
and $10 billion, respectively.
 
The major rating
agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at September 30, 2007 appear
in the table below. The Standard and Poors and Moodys Investors Services
ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2006. In May, Fitch Ratings lowered
its ratings on senior long-term debt from AA- to A+ and on commercial paper
from F1+ to F1. Fitch changed its ratings following the companys issuance of
new debt utilized to fund the accelerated share repurchase. The company has no
contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would
result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. The
company believes its earnings and cash flow growth provide sufficient
flexibility within the existing credit ratings to continue to execute its
current investment, dividend and acquisition strategies.

The
table appearing on page 44 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report presents the way
in which management reviews its cash flows for each of the past five years and
is accompanied by a description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and
reviewed. While the company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, on page 7
of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events underlying sources and
uses of cash in that format on pages 39 and 40 of this Form 10-Q, the
following is the management view of cash flows for the first nine months of
2007 and 2006 prepared in a manner consistent with the table on page 44 of
the 2006 IBM Annual Report:

From the perspective of how management views cash
flows, in the first nine months of 2007, Net cash from operating activities,
excluding Global Financing accounts receivable, was $8.7 billion, an increase
of $1.4 billion compared to the first nine months of 2006. In addition,
management also focuses on free cash flow which is defined as Net cash from
operating activities, excluding Global Financing accounts receivable, less
Capital expenditures, net. Free cash flow in the first nine months of 2007 was
$5.2 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion year-to-year. Cash performance in the
first nine months was
 
44





 
driven by the growth in net income from continuing
operations, continued focus on working capital including lower pension funding
year over year.
 
Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics
discussed above include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation or future pension funding requirements during periods of severe and
prolonged downturns in the capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an
adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely
described in Note 13 on pages 17 to 19 of this Form 10-Q. With respect to
pension funding, the company is not quantifying any future impact from pension
funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets.
 
Global Financing
 
Global Financing is a business segment within IBM that is measured as if it were a
standalone entity. Accordingly, the information presented in this section is
consistent with this separate company view.

Global Financing revenue increased 5.1 percent in the third quarter of
2007 versus the same period in 2006. External revenue increased 6.1 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency) driven by used equipment sales revenue of $166
million in 2007 versus $137 million in 2006. Internal revenue increased 3.2
percent driven by financing revenue of $175 million in 2007 versus $150 million
in 2006 due primarily to an increase in the average asset balance financed. This
increase is partially offset by used equipment sales of $173 million in 2007
versus $187 million in 2006, a decrease of 7.5 percent, due primarily to lower sales
to the Systems and Technology segment.
 
Global Financing revenue
increased 3.1 percent in the first nine months of 2007 versus the same period
in 2006. External revenue increased 5.1 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency) driven by used equipment sales of $489 million in 2007 versus $439
million in 2006, and financing revenue of $1,345 million in 2007 versus $1,305
million in 2006, an increase of 3.0 percent due to an increase in the average
external asset balance financed. Internal revenue decreased 0.2 percent driven
by used equipment sales of $527 million in the first nine months of 2007 versus
$605 million in the same period in 2006, a decrease of 12.9 percent, due
primarily to lower sales to the Systems and Technology segment. This decrease
is partially offset by internal financing revenue of $510 million in 2007
versus $434 million in 2006, due primarily to an increase in the average asset
balance financed.
 
Global Financing gross
profit increased $22 million or 4.6 percent for the third quarter and increased
$16 million or 1.0 percent in the first nine months of 2007 when compared to
the same periods last year. For the third quarter of 2007, the increase in
gross profit was primarily driven by used equipment sales gross profit of $134
million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $106 million in 2006, an increase
of 26.7 percent due to an increase in gross profit on internal used equipment
sales. The gross profit margin decreased 0.2 points driven by lower financing
margins due to higher borrowing costs, partially offset by the improvement in
internal equipment sales margins. For the first nine months of 2007, the
increase in gross profit was driven primarily by the increases in financing
revenue discussed above, partially offset by the higher borrowing costs. The
gross profit margin decreased 1.1 points driven by lower financing margins due
to higher borrowing costs, partially offset by an improvement in equipment
sales margins.
 
45





 
Global
Financing pre-tax income increased 1.1 percent for the third quarter and
decreased 2.2 percent in the first nine months of 2007 when compared to the
same periods last year. The increase in the third quarter was driven by the
increase in gross profit of $22 million discussed above, partially offset by an
increase in selling, general and administrative expense and other
income/expense of $18 million primarily due to less bad debt expense reductions
this year versus last year. The decrease in the first nine months of 2007 is
primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expense and
other income/expense of $39 million, partially offset by the increase in gross
profit of $16 million discussed above.
 
The
decrease in return-on-equity in the third quarter of 2007 versus the third
quarter of 2006, and for the first nine months of 2007 compared to the first
nine months of 2006, was primarily due to a higher average equity balance.

(c) These assets, along with all other financing
assets in this table, are leveraged at the value in the table using Global Financing
debt.
 
(d) Global Financing debt is comprised of
intercompany loans and external debt. The portion of Global Financing debt that
is in support of the companys internal business, or related to intercompany mark-up
embedded in the Global Financing assets, is eliminated in consolidation and
therefore does not appear on pages 6 and 42.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to originate client and
commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for end users consist
primarily of IBM
hardware, software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients total solutions
requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type, direct
financing and operating leases for equipment as well as loans for hardware,
software and services with terms generally for two to seven years. Global
Financings client loans are primarily for software and services and are
unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis in order to
mitigate the associated risk. Unsecured loan agreements include protective
 
46





 
language, security deposit advances and dollar limits on how much can
be financed in order to minimize credit risk. Client financing also includes
internal activity as described on page 49 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report.
 
Commercial financing receivables arise primarily from inventory and
accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subject to additional credit
actions in order to mitigate the associated risk.

Total new originations exceeded cash collections in the third quarter of
2007, which resulted in a net increase in financing assets from June 30, 2007.
The increase in originations for the three months ending September 30, 2007
versus 2006 was due to the increase in commercial financing originations,
partially offset by a decrease in client financing originations during the same
period. For the first nine months of 2007, new originations of client financing
assets exceeded cash collections; however, 
this was offset by cash collections of commercial financing assets
exceeding new financing originations, resulting in a net decline in financing
assets from December 31, 2006. The increase in originations was due to
improving volumes in both client and commercial financing for the first nine
months of 2007 versus 2006.
 
Cash generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay
intercompany payables and dividends to IBM.

The percentage of financing receivables reserved decreased from 1.5
percent at December 31, 2006 to 1.4 percent at September 30, 2007 due to the
disposition of previously reserved receivables combined with lower requirements
for additional reserves. Unallocated reserves decreased 14.5 percent from
$76 million at December 31, 2006 to $65 million at September 30,
2007. The decrease in unallocated reserves is due to the improved credit
quality of the portfolio, as well as the decline in gross financing
receivables. Specific reserves decreased 13.9 percent from $294 million at
December 31, 2006 to $253 million at September 30, 2007. The decrease in
specific reserves was due to the disposition of reserved receivables during the
period combined with lower requirements for additional specific reserves.
 
Global Financings bad debt expense was a reduction of $8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, compared with a reduction of
$27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The continued
reduction in bad debt expense was primarily attributed to the improved credit
quality of the portfolio.
 
Residual Value
 
Residual value is a risk unique to the
financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to
accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing
has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based
upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors
projections of future equipment values and compares them to the residual values
reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global
Financing optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced
from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease
arrangements with current clients. Sales of used equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at the end of a lease, represented 34.9 percent
and 35.4 percent of Global Financings revenue in the third quarter and first
nine months, respectively, of 2007 and 35.0 percent and 37.5 percent in the
third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2006. The decrease in the
third quarter of 2007 and the decrease for the first nine months of 2007 was
driven by a decline in internal used equipment sales. The gross margins on
these sales were 39.4 percent and 32.6 percent in the third quarter of 2007 and
2006, respectively. The increase is driven primarily by higher margin internal
used equipment sales. The gross margins were 42.0 percent and 38.1 percent for
the first nine months of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year to date increase
is also driven primarily by higher margin internal used equipment sales.
 
The following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed
residual value for sales-type and operating leases at December 31, 2006 and
September 30, 2007. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a
percentage of the related original amount financed, and a run out of when the
unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30,
2007 is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. The residual value guarantee
increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining the
classification of a lease as a sales-type lease or operating lease. The
aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees were $156 million
and $204 million for the financing transactions originated during the
quarters ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively, and
$473 million and $447 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed
future values at the scheduled end of lease were $8 million and
$10 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters
ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively, and $22 million
and $19 million for the financing transactions originated during the nine
months ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. The cost of
guarantees was $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 and
$1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, and
$2.9 million and $3.3 million for each of the nine months ended
September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.

Global Financing funds its operations primarily through borrowings
using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1. The debt is used
to fund Global Financing assets and is composed of intercompany loans and
external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to
substantially match the term and currency underlying the receivables. The
intercompany loans are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 46.
 
The Global Financing business provides funding predominantly for the
companys external clients but also provides intercompany financing for the
company (internal). As previously stated, the company manages and measures
Global Financing as if it were a standalone entity and accordingly, interest
expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and
internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations
on pages 45 and 46 and in Segment Information on pages 57 and 58.
 
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on pages 3 and 4,
however, the interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing
to the company is reclassified from Cost of Financing to Interest Expense.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Global Financing is a segment of the company and as such is supported
by the companys liquidity position and access to capital markets. Cash
generated from operations was deployed to reduce debt and pay dividends to the
company in order to maintain an appropriate debt to equity ratio.

Looking Forward
 
Given Global Financings mission of supporting IBMs hardware, software
and services businesses, originations for both client and commercial finance businesses
will be dependent upon the overall demand for IT hardware, software, and
services, as well as client participation rates.
 
Interest rates and the overall economy (including currency
fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit. The companys
interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the Global
Financing funding strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to changes
in interest rates. The companys policy of matching asset and liability
positions in foreign currencies will limit the impacts of currency
fluctuations.
 
The economy could impact the credit quality of the Global Financing
receivable portfolio and therefore the level of provision for bad debt. Global
Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies in both the
origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed above, Global Financing has historically been able to
manage residual value risk through both insight into the product cycles as well
as through its remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each of the key risks
involved in financing. These policies, combined with product and client
knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business going
forward, even during periods of economic uncertainty.

(1)        On April 24, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized $15.0 billion in
funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase program; the company
stated that it may repurchase shares on the open market or in private
transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions, depending on
market conditions. See Note 7 on pages 12 and 13 for additional information
regarding the accelerated share repurchase agreements executed in the second
quarter of 2007. The common stock repurchase program does not have an
expiration date. As discussed in Note 7, the company does not expect the
accelerated share repurchase agreements settlement periods to conclude until
March 2008. Until that time, the company does not plan to make additional stock
repurchases. Also, at this time, the company does not anticipate requesting Board
of Directors approval for additional funds for common stock repurchases prior
to April 2008. This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the
exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock options
or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with
employee equity awards.
 
(2)          The remaining authorization may be used for
the settlement of the accelerated share repurchase agreements or additional
common stock repurchases after the final settlement under the accelerated share
repurchase agreements. As discussed in Note 7 on pages 12 and 13, the company elected
a cash payment for the first settlement under the accelerated share repurchase
agreements in September 2007, resulting in a reduction of $151.8 million to the
remaining authorization.
