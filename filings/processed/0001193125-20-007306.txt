SCHMITT INDUSTRIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1:  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 Basis of Presentation  In the opinion of
management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Schmitt Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and contain all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly its financial position as of November 30, 2019 and its results of operations and its cash flows for the periods presented. The Consolidated Balance Sheet
at May 31, 2019 has been derived from the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. The accompanying unaudited financial statements and related notes should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be experienced for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2020.  As described in Note 8, the Company sold the Schmitt
Dynamic Balance Systems (“SBS”) business line on November 22, 2019. After the sale of the SBS business, based on the types of products and services sold, and an analysis of how the Chief Operating Decision Makers review, manage and
are compensated, the Company determined that it operates as one segment.  Principles of Consolidation 
These Consolidated Financial Statements include those of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc. and Schmitt
Industries (Canada) Limited. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Reclassification  Certain amounts in the prior period
Consolidated Balance Sheet have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current period.  Revenue Recognition 
The Company determines the amount of revenue it recognizes associated with the transfer of each product or service. For sales of products or delivery of
monitoring services to all customers, each transaction is evaluated to determine whether there is approval and commitment from both the Company and the customer for the transaction; whether the rights of each party are specifically identified;
whether the transaction has commercial substance; whether collectability from the customer is probable at the inception of the contract and whether the transaction amount is defined. If a transaction to sell products or provide monitoring services
meets all of the above criteria, revenue is recognized for the sales of product at the time of shipment or for monitoring services at the completion of the month in which monitoring services are provided. 
The Company incurs commissions associated with the sales of products, which are accrued and expensed at the time the product is shipped. These amounts are
recorded within general, administration and sales expense. The Company also incurs costs related to shipping and handling of its products, the costs of which are expensed as incurred as a component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling fees billed
to customers, which are recognized at the time of shipment as a component of net revenues, were $6,534 and $7,896 for the six months ended November 30, 2019 and November 30, 2018, respectively. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  The Company
generally invests its excess cash in money market funds. The Company’s investment policy also allows for cash to be invested in investment grade highly liquid securities, and the Company considers securities that are highly liquid, readily
convertible into cash and have original maturities of less than three months when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash consists of demand deposits in large financial institutions and money market funds. At times, balances may
exceed federally insured limits.  Restricted cash consists of an amount held in escrow related to the sale of the balancer business segment, as described
in Note 8. Once certain events are complete, the restrictions on this cash payment will be released. 
  Page 7 




The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported
within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of November 30, 2019 and May 31, 2019 to the sum of the same such amounts as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the respective periods then ended: 
Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended November 30, 2019 and year ended May 31, 2019: 
 
 Accounts Receivable  The
Company maintains credit limits for all customers based upon several factors, including but not limited to financial condition and stability, payment history, published credit reports and use of credit references. Management performs various
analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value. This review includes using accounts receivable agings, other operating trends and relevant business conditions, including general
economic factors, as they relate to each of the Company’s domestic and international customers. In the event there is doubt about whether a customer account is collectible, a reserve is provided. If these analyses lead management to the
conclusion that a customer account is uncollectible, the balance will be directly charged to bad debt expense. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $81,158 and $36,826 as of November 30, 2019 and May 31, 2019, respectively. 
Inventories  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
or net realizable value with cost determined on the average cost basis. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, which are related to the purchase or production of inventories. Write-downs, when required,
are made to reduce excess inventories to their net realizable values. Such estimates are based on assumptions regarding future demand and market conditions. If actual conditions become less favorable than the assumptions used, an additional
inventory write-down may be required. As of November 30, 2019 and May 31, 2019 inventories consisted of:   
 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of three to seven years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment; and twenty-five years for buildings and improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. As of November 30, 2019 and May 31,
2019, property and equipment consisted of:   
 Depreciation expense for the six months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 was $30,986 and $36,683, respectively. 
  Page 8 




Lease Accounting 
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or a service contract at inception. Where an arrangement is a lease the Company determines if it is an
operating lease or a finance lease. Subsequently, if the arrangement is modified the Company reevaluates the classification.  Buildings leased to others
under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment. See Note 6.  Intangible Assets 
Amortizable intangible assets, which include purchased technology and patents, are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to seventeen
years. As of November 30, 2019 and May 31, 2019, amortizable intangible assets were $2,200,883, and accumulated amortization was $1,860,989 and $1,808,698, respectively. Amortization expense for both the six months ended November 30,
2019 and 2018 was $52,291.  Customer Deposits and Prepayments 
Customer deposits and prepayments consists of amounts received from customers as prepayments for orders that have been received and have been produced but have
not yet shipped, credit balances for items returned by customers for which refunds have not yet been provided and deposits made by customers in advance of production. 
Use of Estimates  The preparation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  NOTE 2: 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In February
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing. The new standard requires companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposed a dual model for
recognizing expense. The Company adopted the standard as of June 1, 2019, with retroactive reporting for prior periods (the comparative option). Adoption of these accounting changes did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance
to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning in 2019. Adoption of these accounting changes did not have a
material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which
changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the
classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in 2019. Adoption of these accounting changes did not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.  In June 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance that expands the scope of Topic 718 to
include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of these accounting changes did not have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 3: 
STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  Stock-based
compensation includes expense charges for all stock-based awards to employees and directors granted under the Company’s stock option plan. Stock-based compensation recognized during the period is based on the portion of the grant date fair
value of the stock-based award that will vest during the period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is recognized using the straight-line method. 
Stock Options  The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option pricing model as its method of valuation for stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results. These variables
include, but are not limited to:   


 
•
 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently
available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award.   


 
•
 
 Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to
be outstanding. The Company determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and pre-vesting and post-vesting
forfeitures.   


 
•
 
 Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock (the “Common
Stock”) at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its Common Stock. The volatility factor the Company uses is based on its historical stock prices over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
award. These historical periods may exclude portions of time when unusual transactions occurred.   


 
•
 
 Expected Dividend Yield. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of 0.   


 
•
 
 Expected Forfeitures. The Company uses relevant historical data to estimate
pre-vesting option forfeitures. The Company records stock-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest. 
There were no options granted during the six months ended November 30, 2019. 
At November 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding stock options to purchase 236,666 shares of Common Stock all of which are vested and exercisable with a
weighted average exercise price of $2.35. As all options outstanding as of November 30, 2019 were fully vested, the Company estimates that $0 will be recorded as additional stock-based compensation expense during the year ending May 31,
2020.   

  Page 10 




Options granted, exercised, canceled and expired under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans
during the six months ended November 30, 2019 are summarized as follows:   
 Restricted Stock Units 
Service-based and market-based restricted stock units are granted to key employees and members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Service-based
restricted stock units generally fully vest on the first anniversary date of the award. Market-based restricted stock units are contingent on continued service and vest based on 15-day average closing price of
the Company’s Common Stock equal or exceeding certain targets established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  The lattice model
utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market conditions stipulated in the award and calculates the fair value of each restricted stock unit. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the
fair value of the restricted stock units: 
 During the six months ended November 30, 2019, three tranches of the market-based restricted stock units granted in
Fiscal 2019 vested.  During the six months ended November 30, 2019, 41,976 service-based restricted stock units were granted and 35,754 immediately
vested on the date of the grants.  Restricted stock unit activity under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans during the six months ended
November 30, 2019 is summarized as follows:   
 During the six months ended November 30, 2019, the Company issued 23,000 shares of common stock related to restricted
stock units which were granted, vested, and expensed in a prior period.  During the six months ended November 30, 2019, total restricted stock unit
compensation expense recognized was $192,602 and has been recorded as general, administration and sales expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Stock compensation expense related to
non-vested restricted stock units with a time vesting condition was $932.

NOTE 4: 
WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES AND RECONCILIATION  Basic net
income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, adjusted for
dilutive incremental shares attributed to outstanding options to purchase Common Stock and restricted stock units vested but not issued.    Common stock equivalents for stock options are computed using the treasury stock method.
In periods in which a net loss is incurred, no common stock equivalents are included since they are antidilutive and as such all stock options outstanding are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss in those periods. 
For the three and six months ended November 30, 2019, potentially dilutive securities consisted of options of 236,666 shares of Common Stock at prices
ranging from $1.70 to $3.65 per share. Of these potentially dilutive securities, none of the shares of Common Stock underlying the options are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the Company incurred a net loss from
continuing operations. In periods when a net loss is incurred in continuing operations, no Common Stock equivalents are included in the calculation of diluted net income or loss from discontinued operations or overall Company net income or loss
since they are antidilutive. As such, all stock options outstanding are excluded from the computation of diluted net income in those periods.  Basic
weighted average shares for the three and six months ended November 30 is as follows:   
 NOTE 5:  INCOME TAXES
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance that the
Company’s future operations will produce sufficient earnings to allow for the deferred tax asset to be fully utilized. The Company currently maintains a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. 
Each year the Company files income tax returns in the various national, state and local income taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax returns
are subject to examination and possible challenge by the taxing authorities. Positions challenged by the taxing authorities may be settled or appealed by the Company. As a result, there is an uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
Company’s financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 740. The Company applies this guidance by defining criteria that an individual income tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements and provides guidance on measurement, de-recognition, classification, accounting for interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
 Other long-term liabilities related to tax contingencies were $0 as of both November 30, 2019 and May 31, 2019. Interest and penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of the “Provision for income taxes.” The liability for payment of interest and penalties was $0 as of November 30, 2019 and May 31, 2019. 
  Page 12 




Several tax years are subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. In the United States, federal tax
years ended May 31, 2016 and after are subject to examination. In the United Kingdom, tax years for the years ended May 31, 2018 and after are subject to examination. 
Effective Tax Rate  The effective tax rate for the three
months ended November 30, 2019 was 1.5%. The effective tax rate on consolidated net income for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to changes in the deferred tax
valuation allowance and the impact of certain expenses not being deductible for income tax reporting purposes. Management believes the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020 will be approximately 1.6% due to the items noted above. 
NOTE 6:  LEASES 
On November 22, 2019, the Company entered in a commercial lease agreement, which will be accounted for pursuant to (ASU)
No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and will present property
revenues as other income, combined based upon the lease being determined to be the predominant component.  The lessor commercial agreement contains a 10-year term with a renewal option to extend, which will be considered a new, separate contract and will be recognized at the time the option is exercised on a straight-line basis over the renewal period, and early
termination options based on established terms specific to the individual agreement. Minimum future lease payments receivable are as follows:   
 NOTE 7:  CUSTOMER
CONCENTRATION  The Company’s largest 3 customers accounted for 14.6%, 10.1%, and 4.6% of our revenues, respectively, for the three months ended
November 30, 2019 and 14.8%, 10.3%, and 4.4% of our revenues, respectively, for the six months ended November 30, 2019.  NOTE 8: 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  On October 10, 2019, the
Company entered into an agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) to sell the Schmitt Dynamic Balance Systems (“SBS”) business line to Tosei Engineering Corp. and Tosei America, Inc. (collectively “Tosei” or Buyer) for a
purchase price of $10,500,000 in cash. The transaction closed on November 22, 2019 and included certain assets held by the U.S. parent company and all the outstanding stock of the UK subsidiary, Schmitt Europe Limited. As a result, the
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows relating to our SBS business line are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.    The purchase agreement contains customary
requirements of closing, including adjustments based on the final amount of working capital transferred to the Buyer. 
  Page 13 




The consideration included $9,940,000 in unrestricted cash from the Buyer at closing, plus $420,000 to be
placed into an escrow account, net of $140,000 in minimum cash settled via the funds flow at closing. Remaining escrow funds become unrestricted after certain events are completed and after one year from closing. The Purchase Agreement requires an
adjustment to purchase price after closing based on the difference between (a) the calculated amount of working capital at closing and (b) the target working capital of $4,200,000. The closing working capital calculation has not been
completed; however, the Company does not expect any resulting adjustment to be significant.  In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company
entered into a Transition Service Agreement (“TSA”) with the Buyer during the transition of certain accounting and treasury processes. The Company has collected $196,000 of cash on behalf of the Buyer via the TSA that is included in the
cash and cash equivalents and other accrued liabilities balances at November 30, 2019.  The following table summarizes the consideration and gain
recognized in the quarter ended November 30, 2019 associated with the sale of the SBS Business:   
 The following are the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale and included as a part of
discontinued operations:

The following is a composition of the line items constituting income from discontinued operations: 
 
 NOTE 9:  SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS  On December 3, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan to buy up to $2 million of
its Common Stock. The Company intends to purchase shares from time to time through open market and private transactions in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The plan is authorized through December 16, 2020. 
On December 17, 2019, the Company acquired 365,490 shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”) at $3.25 per share from Walter Brown Pistor (the
“Acquisition”).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements 
This Quarterly Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q (the “Report”), including “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Item 2, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding future events and the future
results of Schmitt Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions about the Company’s business. Words such as
“expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “sees,” “estimates” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted
in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in the “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
elsewhere in this Report as well as those discussed from time to time in the Company’s other Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions. Such
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of this Report. If we update or correct one or more forward-looking statements, investors and others should not conclude that we will make additional updates or corrections with respect to other forward-looking
statements.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Schmitt
Industries, Inc. (“Schmitt” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and sells high precision test and measurement products, solutions and services. As described under Note 8, on October 10, 2019, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell the Schmitt Dynamic Balance Systems (“SBS”) business line to Tosei Engineering Corp. and Tosei America, Inc. for a purchase price of $10,500,000 in cash (the“SBS Transaction”). The transaction closed on
November 22, 2019 and included certain assets held by the U.S. parent company and all the outstanding stock of the UK subsidiary, Schmitt Europe Limited. As a result, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows relating to our
SBS business line are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.  We provide the products and services through our
Acuity® and Xact® Product lines:   


 
•
 
 Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc., the Company manufacturers and sells
products in two core product lines, Acuity and Xact:   


 
•
 
 Acuity® sells products, solutions and services that
includes laser and white light sensor distance, measurement and dimensional sizing products;   


 
•
 
 Xact® product line includes ultrasonic-based remote tank
monitoring products and related monitoring revenues for markets in the Internet of Things (“IoT”) environment. The Xact products measure the fill levels of tanks holding propane, diesel and other tank-based liquids and the related
monitoring services, which includes transmission of fill data from the tanks via satellite to a secure web site for display.  The
accompanying unaudited financial information should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.

Critical Accounting Policies  There were no material
changes in our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2019, other than the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” which the Company adopted on June 1, 2019.

 Company revenue decreased $124,897 or 10.8%, to $1,033,102 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 as compared to
$1,157,999 in November 30, 2018, primarily due to a 18.8% decrease in Xact product revenue and a 31.6% decrease in Acuity product revenue. Company revenue decreased $276,242, or 11.5%, to $2,127,879 for the six months ended November 30,
2019 as compared to $2,404,121 in November 30, 2018, primarily due to a 44.8% decrease in Xact product revenue and a 15.2% decrease in Acuity product revenue. Xact customers intermittently purchase Xact products based on their respective
business needs and capital expenditure budgets, causing irregular product revenue over quarterly periods.  Revenue by product line for three and six
months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:   

  Page 18 




Gross Margin – Gross margin for the three months ended November 30, 2019 decreased to 37.7%
as compared to 41.6% for the three months ended November 30, 2018. The variances in gross margin between the periods presented were primarily due to unrecoverable inventory costs. Gross margin for the six months ended November 30, 2019
increased to 40.7% as compared to 40.0% for the six months ended November 30, 2018. The variances in gross margin between the periods presented were primarily influenced by favorable product mix shifts, the $70,000 sale of discontinued product

Disclosures about Market Risk  There have been no material changes to the information previously reported under Item 7A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.  Item 4. Controls
and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of November 30, 2019, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on the evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported in a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended
November 30, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting.
