AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 4, 2020 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018 Unaudited1.    Basis of PresentationBasis of Presentation: The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared by Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together “Plexus” or the “Company”) without audit and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the consolidated financial position of the Company as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the results of operations and shareholders' equity for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, and the cash flows for the same three month periods.The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30. The Company uses a “4-4-5” weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter. Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period. Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2020 includes 53 weeks; therefore, the first quarter of fiscal 2020 included 14 weeks while all other fiscal quarters presented herein included 13 weeks.Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations dealing with interim financial statements. However, the Company believes that the disclosures made in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services ("Topic 606"). On September 30, 2018, the Company adopted and applied Topic 606 to all contracts using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an increase to its fiscal 2019 beginning Retained earnings balance of $7.8 million.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (“Topic 842”), which is intended to improve financial reporting of lease transactions by requiring lessees to recognize most leases as a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by leases, but record expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. ASU 2016-02 also requires disclosures regarding the amount, timing and judgments related to accounting for an entity’s leases and related cash flows. On September 29, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which allows financial information for comparative periods prior to adoption not to be updated. The Company recognized right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, but the standard did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. ASC 842 provides optional practical expedients to assist with transition to the new standard. Management elected the package of practical expedients offered, which allows entities to not reassess: (i) whether any contracts prior to the adoption date are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) whether capitalized initial direct costs continue to meet the definition of initial direct costs under the new guidance.  For all new and modified leases after adoption, management elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all of the Company’s leases that qualify, in addition to the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components. Refer to Note 7, "Leases," for further information.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to the accounting for hedging activities. The pronouncement expands and refines hedge accounting, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the 7Table of Contentsassessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the impact of the new standard on future periods will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and required consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company believes that no other recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to its operations.2.    InventoriesInventories as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):In certain circumstances, per contractual terms, customer deposits are received by the Company to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks. The total amount of customer deposits related to inventory and included within current liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019 was $134.0 million and $136.5 million, respectively. 3.    Debt, Finance Lease Obligations and Other FinancingDebt, finance lease obligations and other financing as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “2018 NPA”) pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of $150.0 million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $100.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $50.0 million in principal amount of 4.22% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the “2018 Notes”), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole 8Table of Contentsor in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. As of January 4, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA.On May 15, 2019, the Company refinanced its then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility") by entering into a new 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively with the Prior Credit Facility, referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum commitment from $300.0 million to $350.0 million and extended the maturity from July 5, 2021 to May 15, 2024.  The maximum commitment under the Credit Facility may be further increased to $600.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions. During the three months ended January 4, 2020, the highest daily borrowing was $164.5 million; the average daily borrowings were $128.1 million. The Company borrowed $156.5 million and repaid $189.5 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility during the three months ended January 4, 2020. As of January 4, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Agreement, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.125% as of January 4, 2020. The fair value of the Company’s debt, excluding finance leases, was $219.4 million and $252.3 million as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The carrying value of the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, was $212.0 million and $245.0 million as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, the Company's debt would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 4, "Derivatives," for further information regarding the Company's fair value calculations and classifications.4.    DerivativesAll derivatives are recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. The Company uses derivatives to manage the variability of foreign currency obligations. The Company has cash flow hedges related to forecasted foreign currency obligations, in addition to non-designated hedges to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. The Company designates some foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency expenses. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows. In the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $1.6 million of unrealized gains, net of tax, related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Changes in the fair value of the non-designated derivatives related to recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are recorded in "Miscellaneous, net" in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts for its operations in Malaysia and Mexico on a rolling basis. The Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional value of $79.8 million as of January 4, 2020, and $80.0 million as of September 28, 2019. These forward currency contracts fix the exchange rates for the settlement of future foreign currency obligations that have yet to be realized. The total fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts was a $1.6 million asset as of January 4, 2020, and a $0.6 million liability as of September 28, 2019.The Company had additional forward currency exchange contracts outstanding as of January 4, 2020, with a notional value of $17.2 million; there were $34.4 million such contracts outstanding as of September 28, 2019. The Company did not designate these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to these contracts is recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as either a current or long-term asset or liability, depending on the term, and as an element of "Miscellaneous, net." The total fair value of these derivatives was a $0.1 million asset as of January 4, 2020, and a $0.9 million asset as of September 28, 2019.9Table of ContentsThe tables below present information regarding the fair values of derivative instruments and the effects of derivative instruments on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:Fair Value Measurements:Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The input levels are:Level 1:  Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2:  Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.10Table of ContentsLevel 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.The following table lists the fair values of liabilities of the Company’s derivatives as of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019, by input level:The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined using a market approach, which includes obtaining directly or indirectly observable values from third parties active in the relevant markets. Inputs in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts include prevailing forward and spot prices for currency and interest rate forward curves.5.    Income TaxesIncome tax expense for the three months ended January 4, 2020 was $3.3 million compared to $11.9 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018. The effective tax rates for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018 were 9.5% and 34.9%, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 4, 2020 decreased from the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to the additional impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of $7.0 million recorded during the three months ended December 29, 2018.  The Company also recorded a $1.9 million benefit related to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding foreign tax credits partially offset by $1.1 million of special tax items during the three months ended January 4, 2020. There were no material additions to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded for uncertain tax positions as of January 4, 2020. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties recorded for the three months ended January 4, 2020 was not material.One or more uncertain tax positions may be settled within the next 12 months. Settlement of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company is not currently under examination by taxing authorities in the U.S. The Company is under audit in various foreign jurisdictions but settlement is not expected to have a material impact.The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a net deferred tax asset will not be realized. During the three months ended January 4, 2020, the Company continued to record a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions within the EMEA segment and a partial valuation against its net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions within the AMER segment, as it was more likely than not that these assets would not be fully realized based primarily on historical performance. The Company will continue to provide a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward until it determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.11Table of Contents6.    Earnings Per ShareThe following is a reconciliation of the amounts utilized in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts): For the three months ended January 4, 2020 there were no antidilutive awards.  For the three months ended December 29, 2018 share-based awards for approximately 0.1 million shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were antidilutive.See also Note 12, "Shareholders' Equity," for information regarding the Company's share repurchase plans.7.    LeasesThe Company’s lease portfolio includes both real estate and non-real estate type leases which are accounted for as either finance or operating leases. Real estate leases generally include office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities and non-real estate leases generally include office equipment and vehicles. The Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 41 years. Renewal options that are deemed reasonably certain are included as part of the lease term for purposes of calculating the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liability. Variable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred and include certain index-based changes in rent, certain nonlease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components, as such non-lease components are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and included in the lease expense over the term of the lease. The Company uses a discount rate to calculate the ROU asset and lease liability. When the implicit rate is known or provided in the lease documents, the Company is required to use this rate. In cases in which the implicit rate is not known, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate.Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the date the Company takes possession of the leased assets with expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an estimated total term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, the Company's lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recorded $45.5 million of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, related to its existing operating lease portfolio. The Company also reclassified amounts previously held on the balance sheet to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities upon adoption due to existing arrangements subject to the new standard, including $30.2 million of prepaid leases in other non-current assets. The accounting for the Company’s finance leases remained substantially unchanged. In addition, the company recognized a $1.1 million reduction to retained earnings as a result of two existing build-to-suit arrangements for the facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico that were reassessed to be finance leases under the new standard. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 12Table of ContentsAs a result of the adoption, the following adjustments were made to the opening balances of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):The components of lease expense for three months ended January 4, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):Based on the nature of the ROU asset, amortization of finance right-of-use assets, operating lease expense and other lease expense are recorded within either cost of goods sold or selling and administrative expenses and interest on finance lease liabilities is recorded within interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other lease expense includes lease expense for leases with an estimated total term of twelve months or less and variable lease expense related to variations in lease payments as a result of a change in factors or circumstances occurring after the lease possession date.13Table of ContentsThe following tables sets forth the amount of lease assets and lease liabilities included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was (in thousands):Other information related to the Company’s leases was as follows:14Table of ContentsFuture minimum lease payments required under finance and operating leases as of January 4, 2020, were as follows (in thousands):As of January 4, 2020, the Company’s future operating leases that have not yet commenced are immaterial.Future minimum lease payments required under long-term operating and capital leases as of September 28, 2019, were as follows (in thousands):8.    Share-Based CompensationThe Company recognized $5.0 million and $4.8 million of compensation expense associated with share-based awards for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, respectively. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock-settled appreciation rights ("SARs"). The Company uses its stock price on grant date as the fair value assigned to restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Performance stock units ("PSUs") are payable in shares of the Company's common stock. Beginning for fiscal 2017 grants, PSUs vest based on the relative total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company's common stock as compared to the companies in the Russell 3000 index, a market condition, and the Company's economic return performance during the three year performance period, a performance condition. The Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of PSUs at the date of grant for PSUs that vest based on the relative TSR of the Company's common stock. The Company uses its stock price on grant date as the fair value assigned to PSUs that vest based on the Company's economic return performance. The number of shares that may be issued pursuant to PSUs ranges from zero to 0.5 million and is dependent upon the Company's TSR and economic return performance over the applicable performance periods.The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense over the share-based awards' vesting period. 15Table of ContentsPlexus Corp.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements9.    LitigationThe Company is party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material positive or adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.10.    Reportable SegmentsReportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or group, in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company’s resources on a regional basis. Net sales for the segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment’s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income (loss). A segment’s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses primarily represent corporate selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring costs and other charges, if any. These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm’s length transactions. The accounting policies for the segments are the same as for the Company taken as a whole.Information about the Company’s three reportable segments for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, respectively, is as follows (in thousands):16Table of Contents11.    GuaranteesThe Company offers certain indemnifications under its customer manufacturing agreements. In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers’ customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company’s negligence, misconduct, breach of contract, or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most agreements have contractual limits, some do not. However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company’s adherence to customers’ specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be used, by its customers. The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company. Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company’s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months. The Company’s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product. The Company’s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or caused other than by the Company.The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues. These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement and are included in the Company's accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in "other current accrued liabilities." The primary factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.Below is a table summarizing the activity related to the Company’s limited warranty liability for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018 (in thousands):12.    Shareholders' EquityOn August 20, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan under which the Company is authorized to repurchase $50.0 million of its common stock (the "2019 Program"). The 2019 Program commenced upon completion of the 2018 Program, as defined below. During the three months ended January 4, 2020, the Company repurchased 90,667 shares under the 2019 Program program for $6.3 million at an average price of $69.82 per share. As of January 4, 2020, $40.4 million of authority remained under the 2019 Program.17Table of ContentsPlexus Corp.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsOn February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan under which the Company was authorized to repurchase $200.0 million of its common stock (the "2018 Program").  During the three months ended December 29, 2018, the Company repurchased 869,949 shares under the 2018 Program program for $50.1 million, at an average price of $57.53 per share. The 2018 Program was completed during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, when all share repurchase authority under it was exhausted.All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock.13.    Trade Accounts Receivable Sale ProgramsThe Company has Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) (the "MUFG RPA"), and HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA"), under which the Company may elect to sell receivables at a discount. These facilities are uncommitted facilities. The MUFG RPA was amended on December 23, 2019 to increase the maximum facility amount from $280.0 million to $340.0 million. The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of January 4, 2020 is $60.0 million. The MUFG RPA will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA discussed above.Transfers of receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the receivables less a discount. The sale discount is recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale.The Company sold $227.8 million and $232.5 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $226.6 million and $231.2 million, respectively. 14.    Revenue from Contracts with CustomersSignificant JudgmentsRevenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.The Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists and when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Contracts are accounted for when they have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.  The Company generally enters into a master services arrangement that establishes the framework under which business will be conducted. These arrangements represent the master terms and conditions of the Company's services that apply to individual orders, but they do not commit the customer to work with, or to continue to work with, the Company nor do they obligate the customer to any specific volume or pricing of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in appropriate situations. Customer purchase orders are received for specific quantities with predominantly fixed pricing and delivery requirements. Thus, for the majority of our contracts, there is no guarantee of any revenue to the Company until a customer submits a purchase order. As a result, the Company generally considers its arrangement with a customer to be the combination of the master services arrangement and the purchase order. Most of the Company's arrangements with customers create a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct.The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin.  18Table of ContentsDetermining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract by contract basis.Generally, there are no subjective customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to goods or services provided; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.The Company does not allow for a general right of return.  Net sales include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and out-of-pocket expenses.  The corresponding shipping and handling costs and out-of-pocket expenses are included in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from net sales.Contract CostsFor contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided.  The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date. There were no other costs to obtain or fulfill customer contracts. Disaggregated RevenueThe table below includes the Company’s revenue for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, respectively, disaggregated by geographic reportable segment and market sector (in thousands):19Table of ContentsFor the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, approximately 91% and 89%, respectively, of the Company's revenue was recognized as products and services were transferred over time, respectively.Contract BalancesThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, contract assets, and deferred revenue on the Company’s accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.Contract Assets:  For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, at which point the customer has been billed and the resulting asset is recorded within accounts receivable.  For performance obligations satisfied over time as work progresses, the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which results in the recognition of contract assets. The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's contract assets for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018 (in thousands):Deferred Revenue:  Deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract, which is included in other accrued liabilities. As of January 4, 2020 and September 28, 2019 the balance of prepayments from customers that remained in Other accrued liabilities was $74.8 million and $67.9 million, respectively.  The advance payment is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract, offset obsolete and excess inventory risks and to protect the company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.  Deferred revenue is recognized into revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met. For performance obligations satisfied over time, recognition will occur as work progresses; otherwise deferred revenue will be recognized based upon shipping terms. 15.    AcquisitionOn July 27, 2018, the Company purchased the assets of one of the business lines of Cascade Controls, Inc., a new product introduction company in Portland, Oregon, for $12.4 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. In the three months ended December 29, 2018, the Company received a $1.2 million purchase price adjustment as a result of a post-closing adjustment. 16.    Subsequent EventOn January 22, 2020, the Company announced the decision to close a leased facility within the AMER segment, and transition the service offerings to another Company-owned facility in the region to provide synergies and cost advantages of a campus environment. We are assessing the impacts of the announcement on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.20Table of ContentsITEM 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS"SAFE HARBOR" CAUTIONARY STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:The statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are guidance or which are not historical facts (such as statements in the future tense and statements including believe, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, goal, target and similar terms and concepts), including all discussions of periods which are not yet completed, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The following table presents selected consolidated financial data (dollars in millions, except per share data):Net sales. For the three months ended January 4, 2020, net sales increased $86.9 million, or 11.4%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. Net sales are analyzed by management by geographic segment, which reflects the Company's reportable segments, and by market sector. Management measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis. The Company’s global business development strategy is based on our targeted market sectors.A discussion of net sales by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):AMER. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the AMER segment decreased $0.4 million, or 0.1%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease in net sales was driven by a reduction in net sales of $16.9 million due to manufacturing transfers to our APAC segment and overall net decreased customer end-market demand in the Communications sector.  The decrease was mostly offset by a $52.6 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and an $11.7 million increase in production ramps for new customers. APAC. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the APAC segment increased $73.0 million, or 19.3%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase in net sales was driven by a $22.9 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers, a $16.9 million increase due to manufacturing transfers from our AMER segment and overall net increased customer end-market demand. The increase was partially offset by a $9.3 million decrease for end-of-life products. EMEA. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the EMEA segment increased $12.2 million, or 16.9%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase in net sales was the result of a $6.0 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and overall net increased customer end-market demand. 22Table of ContentsOur net sales by market sector is presented below (in millions):Healthcare/Life Sciences. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased $11.7 million, or 3.9%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase was driven by a $15.2 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and overall net increased customer end-market demand.  The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $6.4 million for end-of-life products.  Industrial/Commercial. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the Industrial/Commercial sector increased $90.9 million, or 41.5%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase was driven by a $28.0 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and overall net increased customer end-market demand. Aerospace/Defense. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the Aerospace/Defense sector increased $49.6 million, or 40.5%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase was driven by a $29.9 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers, a $5.1 million increase in production ramps for new customers and overall net increased customer end-market demand. Communications. Net sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 in the Communications sector decreased $65.3 million, or 53.0%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand. Cost of sales. Cost of sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased $80.0 million, or 11.5%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, labor costs and overhead. For the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, approximately 89% and 90%, respectively, of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes. Of these amounts, approximately 89% and 90%, respectively, of these costs in each period were related to material and component costs. As compared to the prior year period, the increase in cost of sales for the three months ended January 4, 2020 was primarily due to the increase in net sales and fixed costs to support new program ramps. Gross profit. Gross profit for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased $6.8 million, or 9.4%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. Gross margin of 9.3% decreased by 20 basis points as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The primary driver of the increase in gross profit was the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher fixed costs to support new program ramps and a negative shift in customer mix, which drove the decrease in gross margin.Operating income. Operating income for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased $2.9 million, or 7.8%, as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018 as a result of the increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in selling and administrative expenses  ("S&A") that was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense. Operating margin of 4.7% decreased 10 basis points compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018 primarily due to the decrease in gross margin as a result of the factors discussed above.23Table of ContentsA discussion of operating income by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):AMER. Operating income for the three months ended January 4, 2020 decreased $2.2 million as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018, primarily as a result of increased fixed costs to support new program ramps and an increase in S&A primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix. APAC. Operating income for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased $10.6 million as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales, partially offset by a negative shift in customer mix and increased fixed costs to support new program ramps.EMEA. Operating income for the three months ended January 4, 2020 decreased $1.3 million as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018, primarily as a result of increased fixed costs to support new program ramps and a negative shift in customer mix, partially offset by an increase in net sales. Other expense. Other expense for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased $2.8 million as compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018, primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million in interest expense and the impact of foreign exchange volatility, which resulted in a foreign exchange loss of $0.9 million during the three months ended January 4, 2020 as compared to a $0.2 million foreign exchange gain during the three months ended December 29, 2018.Income taxes. Income tax expense and effective income tax rates is presented below (dollars in millions): (1) We believe the non-GAAP presentation of income tax expense and the effective tax rate excluding special tax items provides additional insight into the change between comparative reporting periods by isolating the impact of these significant, special items. In addition, we believe that our income tax expense, as adjusted, and effective tax rate, as adjusted, enhance the ability of investors to analyze our operating performance and supplement, but do not replace, income tax expense and effective tax rate calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.For the three months ended January 4, 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.9 million benefit related to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding foreign tax credits partially offset by $1.1 million of other special tax items. For the three months ended December 29, 2018, we recorded a $7.0 million adjustment to income tax expense, inclusive of unrecognized tax benefits, as a result of proposed additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform").  24Table of ContentsIncome tax expense for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018 was $3.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of Tax Reform recorded in the three months ended December 29, 2018. During the three months ended January 4, 2020, we recorded a benefit related to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding foreign tax credits partially offset by special tax items.Our U.S. statutory tax rate for fiscal 2020 is 21%. Our effective tax rate varies from our blended U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings as well as a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary within our APAC segment, where we derive a significant portion of our earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate has been impacted by changes due to Tax Reform discussed above. Our effective tax rate may be impacted by disputes with taxing authorities, tax planning activities, adjustments to uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances. The estimated effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be between 13% and 15%.Net income. Net income for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased $8.8 million, or 39.6%, from the three months ended December 29, 2018 to $31.0 million. Net income increased primarily as a result of the increase in operating income and decrease in income tax expense as previously discussed.Diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased to $1.03 from $0.69 for the three months ended December 29, 2018, primarily as a result of increased net income due to the factors discussed above and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding due to repurchase activity under the Company's stock repurchase plans.Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return. We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "economic return." Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and economic return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance. In particular, we provide ROIC and economic return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and economic return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements. We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation, and certain compensation incentives are based on economic return performance.We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling two-quarter period for the first quarter. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt and operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way. ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").We review our internal calculation of WACC annually, and our estimated WACC is 8.8% for fiscal 2020. By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders. ROIC was 14.7% and 14.6% for the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, respectively. For a reconciliation of ROIC and economic return to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.Refer to the table below, which includes the calculation of ROIC and economic return (dollars in millions) for the indicated periods:25Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $255.1 million as of January 4, 2020, as compared to $226.3 million as of September 28, 2019. As of January 4, 2020, 94% of our cash balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. With the enactment of Tax Reform, we believe that our offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner than before Tax Reform. Currently, we believe that our cash balance, together with cash available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and potential share repurchases, if any, for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.Our future cash flows from operating activities will be reduced by $65.1 million due to cash payments for U.S. federal taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings that are payable over an eight year period that began in fiscal 2019 with the first payment. The table below provides the expected timing of these future cash outflows, in accordance with the following installment schedule for the remaining seven years (in millions):Cash Flows. The following table provides a summary of cash flows for the periods presented, excluding the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (in millions): Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $74.7 million for the three months ended January 4, 2020, as compared to cash flows used in operating activities of $33.3 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase was primarily due to cash flow improvements (reductions) of:•$63.0 million in accounts receivable cash flows, which resulted primarily from the timing of shipments.•$57.0 million in accounts payables cash flows driven by increased purchasing activity to support increased net sales. •$42.7 million in inventory cash flows driven by inventory management efforts.•$(25.4) million in customer deposit cash flows driven by a significant deposit received from one customer in the prior year.•$(16.6) million in other current and noncurrent liabilities cash flows driven by decreases in advance payments from customers and accrued salaries and wages due to timing of the quarter-end.26Table of ContentsThe following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days):We calculate days in accounts receivable and contract assets as each balance sheet item for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable, days in contract assets and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits. As of January 4, 2020, annualized cash cycle days decreased twelve days compared to December 29, 2018 due to the following factors:•Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended January 4, 2020 decreased 2 days compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of customer shipments with the additional week in the quarter.•Days in contract assets for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased 2 days compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018.  The increase is due to increased demand from customers with arrangements requiring revenue to be recognized over time as products are produced. •Days in inventory for the three months ended January 4, 2020 decreased eighteen days compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease is primarily attributable to inventory management efforts.•Days in accounts payable for the three months ended January 4, 2020 decreased 7 days compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease is primarily attributable to reduced purchasing activity in connection with our inventory management efforts.•Days in cash deposits for the three months ended January 4, 2020 increased 1 day compared to the three months ended December 29, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to significant deposits received from two customers to cover higher inventory balances. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow ("FCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures. FCF was $61.0 million for the three months ended January 4, 2020 compared to $(58.2) million for the three months ended December 29, 2018, an increase of $119.2 million.Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into ongoing financial performance. In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions. We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.27Table of ContentsA reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP follows (in millions):Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $13.4 million for the three months ended January 4, 2020 compared to $23.7 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to a $11.2 million decrease in capital expenditures, primarily due to the construction of a second manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, Mexico which was completed in the fiscal first quarter of 2020.We estimate funded capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $55.0 to $70.0 million, of which $13.7 million was utilized through the first three months of fiscal 2020. The remaining fiscal 2020 capital expenditures are anticipated to be used primarily to support new program ramps as well as to replace older equipment. We believe our estimated capital expenditures will continue to be funded from cash flows provided by operations, and may be supplemented by available cash or borrowings, if required.Financing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities were $33.1 million for the three months ended January 4, 2020 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $47.3 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $43.7 million decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock and a $9.1 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  This change was partially offset by an increase of $36.0 million in pay-downs on our revolving credit facility. On August 20, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase $50.0 million of its common stock (the "2019 Program"). The 2019 Program commenced upon completion of the 2018 Program, as defined below. During the three months ended January 4, 2020, the Company repurchased 90,667 shares under the 2019 Program for $6.3 million at an average price of $69.82. As of January 4, 2020, $40.4 million of authority remained under the 2019 Program.On February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan under which the Company was authorized to repurchase $200.0 million of its common stock (the "2018 Program"). During the three months ended December 29, 2018, the Company repurchased 869,949 shares under this program for $50.1 million, at an average price of $57.53 per share. The 2018 Program was completed during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, when all share repurchase authority under it was exhausted.All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock.On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “2018 NPA”) pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of $150.0 million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $100.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $50.0 million in principal amount of 4.22% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the “2018 Notes”), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. As of January 4, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA.On May 15, 2019, the Company refinanced its then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility") by entering into a new 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively with the Prior Credit Facility, referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum commitment from $300.0 million to $350.0 million and extended the maturity from July 5, 2021 to May 15, 2024.  The maximum commitment under the Credit Facility may be further increased to $600.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions. During the three months ended January 4, 2020, the highest daily borrowing was $164.5 million; the average daily borrowings were $128.1 million. The Company borrowed $156.5 million and repaid $189.5 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility during the three months ended January 4, 2020. As of January 4, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Agreement, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.175% as of January 4, 2020.28Table of ContentsThe Credit Agreement and the 2018 NPA allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases. We have not paid cash dividends in the past. However, the Board of Directors of the Company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.The Company has Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) (the "MUFG RPA"), and HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA"), under which the Company may elect to sell receivables at a discount. These facilities are uncommitted facilities. The MUFG RPA was amended on December 23, 2019 to increase the maximum facility amount from $280.0 million to $340.0 million. The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of January 4, 2020 is $60.0 million. The MUFG RPA will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA discussed above.The Company sold $227.8 million and $232.5 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during the three months ended January 4, 2020 and December 29, 2018, respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $226.6 million and $231.2 million, respectively. In all cases, the sale discount was recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale. For further information regarding the receivable sale programs, see Note 14, "Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs," in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months. If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms. 29Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONSOur disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in our SEC filings. Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 4, 2020 (dollars in millions):1)As of January 4, 2020, debt obligations includes $150.0 million in principal amount of 2018 Notes as well as interest; see Note 3, "Debt, Finance Lease Obligations and Other Financing," in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.2)As of January 4, 2020, purchase obligations consist primarily of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business.3)As of January 4, 2020, repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings consists of U.S. federal income taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings due to Tax Reform.

We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Foreign Currency RiskOur international operations create potential foreign exchange risk. Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges. Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated periods were as follows: The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above. Based on the Company’s overall currency exposure, as of January 4, 2020, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Interest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk. To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.As of January 4, 2020, our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on the Company's then-current leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of January 4, 2020, the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.10%. The Company is monitoring developments related to LIBOR; see also Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 for more information. Borrowings under the 2018 NPA are based on a fixed interest rate, thus mitigating much of our interest rate risk. Based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure, as of January 4, 2020, a 10.0% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESDisclosure Controls and ProceduresThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2020, other than explained below, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.32Table of ContentsEffective September 29, 2019, we adopted the new leasing standard under ASC 2016-02, Leasing, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of this guidance required changes to our processes, policies and internal controls to meet the impact of the new standard and disclosure requirements.33Table of ContentsPART II.     OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1A.Risk FactorsIn addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed herein, particularly those discussed in the “Safe Harbor” Cautionary Statement and "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part I, Item 2, see the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 that have had no material changes, except as set forth below.The impact of the coronavirus on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business.We are actively assessing and responding where possible to the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.  This includes evaluating the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus.  The significance of the impact on Plexus is yet uncertain; however, a material adverse effect on our employees, customers, suppliers, and logistics providers could have a material adverse effect on Plexus.  In addition, supply chain or logistics disruptions could materially impact our operations outside China since we purchase a meaningful level of components from Chinese suppliers for our sites in other countries.ITEM 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsThe following table provides the specified information about the repurchases of shares by the Company during the three months ended January 4, 2020. * On August 20, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan under which the Company is authorized to repurchase $50.0 million of its common stock (the "2019 Program").
