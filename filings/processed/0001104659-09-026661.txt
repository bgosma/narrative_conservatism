Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis of Presentation: 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto
are unaudited.  In the opinion
of the management of International Business Machines Corporation (the company),
these statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring
nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and gains and losses
not affecting retained earnings that are reported in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results may be different. See
the companys 2008 Annual Report for a discussion of the companys critical
accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should
be read in conjunction with the companys 2008 Annual Report.
 
Within
the financial tables in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not
add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages
presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
 
2. Accounting Changes:  In April 2009,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position
(FSP) Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 157-4 Determining Fair Value When
the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. Based on the
guidance, if an entity determines that the level of activity for an asset or
liability has significantly decreased and that a transaction is not orderly,
further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant
adjustment to the transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate
fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. This FSP is to be applied
prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15,
2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15,
2009. The company will adopt this FSP for its quarter ending June 30,
2009. There is no expected impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In
April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 Recognition and
Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. The guidance applies to
investments in debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairments may
be recorded. If an entitys management asserts that it does not have the intent
to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to
sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, then an entity may
separate other-than-temporary impairments into two components: 1) the amount
related to credit losses (recorded in earnings), and 2) all other amounts
(recorded in other comprehensive income). This FSP is to be applied
prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15,
2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15,
2009. The company will adopt this FSP for its quarter ending June 30,
2009. There is no expected impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In
April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board
(APB) 28-1 Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The
FSP amends SFAS No. 107 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments to require an entity to provide disclosures about fair value of
financial instruments in interim financial information. This FSP is to be
applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending
after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after
March 15, 2009. The company will include the required disclosures in its
quarter ending June 30, 2009.
 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business
Combinations, which became effective January 1, 2009 via prospective
application to business combinations. This Statement requires that the
acquisition method of accounting be applied to a broader set of business
combinations, amends the definition of a business combination, provides a
definition of a business, requires an acquirer to recognize an acquired
business at its fair value at the acquisition date and requires the assets and
liabilities assumed in a business combination to be measured and recognized at
their fair values as of the acquisition date (with limited exceptions). The
company adopted this Statement on January 1, 2009. There was no impact
upon adoption, and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and
significance of business combinations subject to this statement.
 
In
April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets
Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from
Contingencies. This FSP requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair
value if fair value can be reasonably estimated. If
 
7





Table of
Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
fair
value cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liability would generally be
recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies
and FASB Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a
Loss. Further, the FASB removed the subsequent accounting guidance for assets
and liabilities arising from contingencies from SFAS No. 141(R). The
requirements of this FSP carry forward without significant revision the
guidance on contingencies of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which
was superseded by SFAS No. 141(R) (see previous paragraph). The FSP
also eliminates the requirement to disclose an estimate of the range of
possible outcomes of recognized contingencies at the acquisition date. For
unrecognized contingencies, the FASB requires that entities include only the
disclosures required by SFAS No. 5. This FSP was adopted effective January 1,
2009. There was no impact upon adoption, and its effects on future periods will
depend on the nature and significance of business combinations subject to this
statement.
 
In
April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful
Life of Intangible Assets. The FSP states that in developing assumptions about
renewal or extension options used to determine the useful life of an intangible
asset, an entity needs to consider its own historical experience adjusted for
entity-specific factors. In the absence of that experience, an entity shall
consider the assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or
extension options. This FSP is to be applied to intangible assets acquired
after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this FSP did not have an impact on
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51.
This Statement requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a
subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance
on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling
interest and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires
additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of
the controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition
provisions of SFAS No. 160, the company adopted the Statement on January 1,
2009 via retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure
requirements. Noncontrolling interests of $119 million at December 31, 2008
were reclassified from the Liabilities section to the Stockholders Equity
section in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of January 1,
2009. Noncontrolling interest amounts of $2 million and $12 million, net of
tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2008,
respectively, are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings due to immateriality, but are reflected within the other (income) and
expense line item.
 
In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.
SFAS No. 161 expands the current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, such that
entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on an interim basis and annual
basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives; how derivatives and
related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and how
derivatives and related hedged items affect the entitys financial position,
financial results and cash flow. Pursuant to the transition provisions of the
Statement, the company adopted SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009. The
required disclosures are presented in Note 6 on a prospective basis. This Statement
does not impact the consolidated financial results as it is disclosure-only in
nature.
 
In
February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 157. FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157
Fair Value Measurements from 2008 to 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities on January 1, 2009 did not have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3 for SFAS No. 157
disclosures.
 
In
June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1, Determining
Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating Securities, which became effective in 2009 via retrospective
application. Under the FSP, unvested share-based payment awards that contain
non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating
securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share (EPS)
pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per
share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to
dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in
undistributed earnings. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees
prior to December 31, 2007 are considered participating securities as they
receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalents at the same rate as common stock.
RSUs granted after December 31, 2007 do not receive dividend equivalents
and are not considered participating securities. The company retrospectively
adopted the FSP on January 1, 2009. The impact of adopting the FSP

In
November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 08-7, Accounting for
Defensive Intangible Assets. A defensive intangible asset is an asset acquired
in a business combination or in an asset acquisition that an entity does not
intend to actively use. According to the guidance, defensive intangible assets
are considered to be a separate unit of account and valued based on their
highest and best use from the perspective of an external market participant.
The company adopted EITF 08-7 on January 1, 2009. There was no impact upon
adoption, and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance
of the business combinations subject to this statement.
 
In
December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP amends SFAS No. 132(R),
Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits to
require more detailed disclosures about the fair value measurements of
employers plan assets including (a) investment policies and strategies; (b) major
categories of plan assets; (c) information about valuation techniques and
inputs to those techniques, including the fair value hierarchy classifications
(as defined by SFAS No. 157) of the major categories of plan assets; (d) the
effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level
3) on changes in plan assets; and (e) significant concentrations of risk
within plan assets. The disclosures required by the FSP will be included in the
companys year ending 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements. This Statement
does not impact the consolidated financial results as it is disclosure-only in
nature.

At March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
 
Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Nonrecurring Basis
 
In the fourth quarter of
2008, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $81 million
for an equity method investment. The resulting investment which was classified
as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy was valued using a discounted cash flow
model. The valuation inputs included an estimate of future cash flows,
expectations about possible variations in the amount and timing of cash flows
and a discount rate based on the risk-adjusted cost of capital. Potential
results were assigned probabilities that resulted in a weighted average or
most-likely discounted cash flow fair value as of December 31, 2008. The
fair value of the investment after impairment was $7 million at December 31,
2008. In the first quarter of 2009, the balance of this investment was further
reduced by an additional impairment of $3 million and other adjustments
primarily related to dividends. The balance of this investment was zero at March 31,
2009.

is reflected net of unearned income of $1,005 million and $1,049 million
and of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $217 million and $217 million at
those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables relate to loans that are provided by Global
Financing primarily to the companys clients to finance the purchase of the
companys software and services. Separate contractual relationships on these
financing arrangements are for terms ranging from two to seven years. Each
financing contract is priced independently at competitive market rates. The
company has a history of enforcing the terms of these separate financing
agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $257 million and $373 million at March 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of March 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008.

6. Derivatives
and Hedging Transactions:
 
The company operates in
multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the
global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the
impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a
lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The
company limits these risks by following established risk management policies
and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective,
financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For
interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements
between the interest rates associated with the companys lease and other
financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt.
Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of
derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties
to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To
mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy of only
entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based
upon their credit ratings and other factors. The companys established policies
and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions include
reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing
the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain
of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the
arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the
maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.
 
11





Table of Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
The aggregate fair value
of derivative instruments in net asset positions as of March 31, 2009 was
$1,762 million. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date as a result of the counterparties failing to perform as
contracted. This exposure is reduced by $822 million of liabilities included in
master netting arrangements with those counterparties.
 
The company employs derivative instruments to hedge
the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency
exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect
to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, expose the company to liquidity risk as the
derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not
offset by the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors
the cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these
hedging relationships by de-designating the derivative instrument to manage
this liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company
may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in fair value of the
de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity. The
company expended $144 million related to maturities of derivative instruments
that existed in qualifying net investment hedge relationships in the three
months ending March 31, 2009. At March 31, 2009, the company had net
assets of $149 million, representing the fair value of derivative instruments
in qualifying net investment hedge relationships. The weighted-average
remaining maturity of these instruments at March 31, 2009 was
approximately two years. In addition, at March 31, 2009, the company had
net liabilities of $699 million representing the fair value of derivative
instruments that were previously designated in qualifying net investment
hedging relationships but were de-designated prior to March 31, 2009; of
this amount $406 million is expected to mature over the next twelve months. The
notional amount of these instruments at March 31, 2009 was $7,712 million
including original and offsetting transactions.
 
In its hedging programs,
the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and
currency swaps, depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not
party to leveraged derivatives or derivatives with contingent credit features.
 
A brief description of
the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings
 
The company issues debt
in the global capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan
portfolio. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate
mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce
overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges). At March 31, 2009, the total notional amount of the
companys interest rate swaps was $6,807 million.
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to
interest rate volatility on forecasted debt issuances. To manage this risk, the
company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the
interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at March 31, 2009.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net
Investment)
 
A significant portion of
the companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a
hedge of net investment to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of
major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also
uses currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk
management purpose. At March 31, 2009, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1,000 million.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
The companys operations generate
significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In
 
12





Table of Contents
 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and
in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively
employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These
forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of
time over which the company is hedging its exposure to the variability in
future cash flows is approximately four years. At March 31, 2009, the
total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of
forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $19,122 million with a
weighted-average remaining maturity of 488 days.
 
Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign
currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional
currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. At March 31, 2009, the total notional amount of cross-currency
swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was
$300 million.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency
Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its
Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers
principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective
manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to
economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion
of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these
forward and swap contracts are generally less than two years. The changes in
the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are
generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2009, the total notional
amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency
exposure was $8,957 million.
 
Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to
equity price changes related to certain obligations to employees. These equity
exposures are primarily related to market price movements in certain broad
equity market indices and in the companys own stock. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling, general
and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes
equity derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge
the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives
are linked to the total return on certain broad equity market indices or the
total return on the companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value
with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2009, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments in economic hedges of equity risk was $465 million.
 
Other Risks
 
The company holds
warrants to purchase approximately 0.5 million shares of common stock in
connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they
contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the
changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The company is exposed to
a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms.
The company utilizes credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit
exposures. These derivatives have terms of one year or less. The swaps are
recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company does not have
any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at March 31,
2009.

provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument
related risk management activity as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2009:

At March 31, 2009,
in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost
transactions, the company recorded net gains of $661 million (before taxes), in
accumulated gains and (losses) not affecting retained earnings. Of this amount,
$531 million of gains are expected to be reclassified to net income within the
next twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the
underlying anticipated transactions. At March 31, 2009, net losses of approximately $16 million (before taxes), were recorded
in accumulated gains and (losses) not affecting retained earnings in connection
with cash flow hedges of the companys borrowings. Of this amount, $13 million
of losses are expected to be reclassified to net income within the next twelve
months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying
transactions.
 
For the three months ending
March 31, 2009, there were no significant gains or losses recognized in
earnings representing hedge ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness (for fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying
exposure that did not or was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor
are there any anticipated in the normal course of business.
 
7. Stock-Based Compensation:  Stock-based compensation cost is measured at
grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the
employee requisite service period. The following table presents total
stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings:

The
reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2009, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior
year, was principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock option
grants ($41 million) partially offset by an increase related to restricted and
performance-based stock units ($9 million).
 
As
of March 31, 2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $949
million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years.
 
There
was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31,
2009 and 2008.
 
8. Retirement-Related
Benefits:  The company
offers defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, as
well as nonpension postretirement plans primarily consisting of retiree medical
benefits. The following table provides the total retirement-related benefit

The company received a $13.2 million subsidy in the
first quarter of 2009 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by
the company to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the
remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the
participants.  For further information
related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see pages 115 and 116 in
the companys 2008 Annual Report.
 
9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
Acquisitions: During the three months ended March 31,
2009, the company did not complete any acquisitions.
 
Divestitures: On March 16, 2009, the company
completed the sale of certain processes, resources, assets and third-party
contracts related to its core logistics operations to Geodis. The company
received cash proceeds of $365 million and recognized a net gain of $298
million on the transaction. The gain was net of the fair value of certain
contractual terms, certain transaction costs and related real estate charges.
As part of this transaction, the company will outsource its logistics
operations to Geodis which will enable the company to leverage industry-leading
skills and scale and improve the productivity of the companys supply chain.

intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business
processes, methodologies and systems, and impacts from currency translation.
 
The
net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $157 million during the
first quarter of 2009, primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles.
The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $312 million and $317 million
for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition,
in the first quarter, the company retired $264 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.
 
The
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to
intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial

12. Segments:  The table on page 52 of
this Form 10-Q reflects the results of the companys reportable segments
consistent with the management system used by the companys chief operating
decision maker. These results are not necessarily a depiction that is in
conformity with GAAP. For example, employee
retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial assumptions on a
country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments based on headcount.  Different results could occur if actuarial
assumptions that are unique to the segments were used. Performance measurement
is based on income before income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are
used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in
allocating resources to, each of the segments.
 
13.
Contingencies:  The company is
involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters
and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its
business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property
(IP), product liability, employment, benefits, securities, foreign operations
and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of
different parties, including competitors, partners, clients, current or former
employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives
of the locations in which the company does business.
 
The
following is a summary of some of the more significant legal matters involving
the company.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and
focus the issues in the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet
issued its decision. On August 10, 2007, the court in another suit, The
SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., issued a decision and order
determining, among other things, that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare
copyrights, and obligating SCO to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims
against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. At the request
of the court in SCO v. IBM, on August 31, 2007, each of the parties filed
a status report with the court concerning the effect of the August 10th
Novell ruling on the SCO v. IBM case, including the pending motions. On September 14,
2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this
case were stayed. In the SCO v. Novell case, on November 25, 2008, SCO
filed its notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,
which included an appeal of the August 10, 2007 ruling.

On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc.
(PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, alleging that PSI violated certain intellectual property rights of IBM.
PSI asserted counterclaims against IBM. On January 11, 2008, the court
permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems, to intervene as
a counterclaim-plaintiff. T3 claims that IBM violated certain antitrust laws by
refusing to license its patents and trade secrets to PSI and by tying the sales
of its mainframe computers to its mainframe operating systems. On June 30,
2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a result of this transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed
all claims against each other, and PSI withdrew a complaint it had filed with
the European Commission in October 2007 with regard to IBM. Litigation
between the company and T3 continues. In January 2009, T3 filed a
complaint with the European Commission alleging that IBM violated European
Commission competition law based on the facts alleged in the pending U.S.
litigation.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 16, 2007 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by SuperSpeed LLC,
which alleges that certain IBM products infringe certain patents relating
generally to cache coherency techniques. SuperSpeed seeks damages and
injunctive relief.
 
The
company and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in an action filed on August 17,
2007 in the United District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by
JuxtaComm Technologies, Inc., which alleges that certain IBM products
infringe a patent relating to the transformation and exchange of data between
different computer systems. JuxtaComm seeks damages and injunctive relief. The
case is set for trial in November 2009.
 
In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea
announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several
companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea
and LG Electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005)
and had also charged employees of some of those entities with, among other
things, bribery of certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea
and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in
these matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM
employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM
were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different
times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance,
which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter. In March 2008,
the company received a request from the SEC for additional information.
 
On
March 27, 2008, the company was temporarily suspended from participating
in new business with U.S. Federal government agencies. The notice of temporary
suspension was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related
to an investigation by the EPA of possible violations of the Procurement
Integrity provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act regarding
a specific bid for business with the EPA originally submitted in March 2006.
In addition, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia
served the company and certain employees with grand jury subpoenas related to
the bid, requesting testimony and documents regarding interactions between
employees of the EPA and certain company employees. On April 4, 2008, the
company announced an agreement with the EPA that terminated the temporary
suspension order. In January 2009, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the
Eastern District of Virginia confirmed that it was closing its investigation
and would bring no charges in this matter. In April 2009, the EPA advised the
company that this matter is closed.
 
The
company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought in Tokyo District Court by
Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover losses that it allegedly
suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy)
proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo Leasing amounts for
which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others liable. The claims in this
suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in
the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages
in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.

The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the
importation of computer software. The total amounts related to these matters
are approximately $2.0 billion, including amounts currently in litigation and other
amounts. In November 2008, the company won a significant case in the
Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil and is
awaiting the published decision of the case. Assuming this decision is upheld,
the remaining total potential amount related to these matters for all
applicable years is approximately $450 million. In addition, the company has
received an income tax assessment from Mexican authorities relating to the
deductibility of certain warranty payments. In response, the company has filed
an appeal in the Mexican Federal Fiscal court. The total potential amount
related to this matter for all applicable years is approximately $450 million.
The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that these amounts
are not meaningful indicators of liability.
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5),
the company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Provisions related to income
tax matters are recorded in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.
Claims and proceedings are reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken
or adjusted to reflect the impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of
counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded
liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended March 31,
2009, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its
experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters
previously referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential
liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters
previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend itself
vigorously in all such matters, it is possible that the companys business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in
any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such
claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material
effect on the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and
amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies;
the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on
the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of
the particular matter which may give rise to additional factors.
 
14. Commitments:  The companys extended lines
of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $4,774 million and
$4,403 million at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
A portion of these amounts was available to the companys business partners to
support their working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to
provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase
agreements for approximately $3,147 million and $3,342 million at March 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
 
The
company has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee or
indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5, by
requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the
likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following is
a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
The
company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters.
Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by
the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants
related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual
property (IP) rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance
of non-financial contractual obligations and certain income taxes.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
In each of these
circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making
a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which
procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other partys claims.
While typically indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum
on the companys payment, the companys obligations under these agreements may
be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the
company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by
the company.
 
It
is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements
have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition
or results of operations.
 
In
addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The
maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $84
million and $50 million at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position was not material.

Within the Management
Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at constant
currency are made so that the financial results and other performance metrics
can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the companys
business performance.
 
In
the first quarter, in a challenging economic environment, the company delivered
$1.70 in diluted earnings per share, an increase of 3.7 percent year to year.
Total revenue decreased 11.4 percent as reported, 3.8 percent adjusted for
currency. Pre-tax income of $3,122 million declined 2.4 percent, however,
pre-tax margin increased 1.3 points due to improvements in gross margin and
expense. Net income margin improved 1.1 points versus the first quarter of
2008, benefiting from an improved tax rate, and the companys ongoing common
share repurchases drove a lower share balance contributing to the improvement
in diluted earnings per share.
 
The company has been
transforming its business over the last decade shifting to higher value areas,
globalizing its operations and consistently focusing on cost reduction and
operational efficiency. These changes have positioned the company to deliver
this financial performance in the current environment.
 
With a focus on higher
value offerings and strong services capabilities, the company has been able to
adapt its offerings to deliver what clients are focusing on, which is primarily
to save costs and conserve capital. The companys services signings reflect its
ability to meet clients needs, with total signings in the quarter up 10
percent at constant currency, and longer-term outsourcing signings increasing
at 27 percent, adjusted for currency.
 
The company has taken
actions that have shifted the mix of its business, and the business model has
become less dependent on hardware, which is more vulnerable to economic
conditions. In the first quarter of 2009, effectively all of the companys
pre-tax profit was generated by services, software and financing. The annuity
nature of these businesses provides a solid base of revenue, profit and cash
flow.

Table of Contents
 
The company has been
investing to capture the opportunity in the growth markets. The companys
constant currency revenue growth in the first quarter (4 percent) in these
markets remained about 8 points higher than in the major markets, consistent
with full year and fourth-quarter 2008 results.
 
The company has had an
ongoing focus on driving productivity in all parts of its business, including
sales operations, supply chain management, services delivery and global support
functions. These efforts have reduced the companys fixed cost base, improving
the operational balance point.
 
As a result of these
actions, the company has built a more resilient business model, one that
generates more profit from each dollar of revenue.
 
The companys revenue performance was impacted by
currency and the economic environment, but the results also reflect its broad
business capabilities and the contribution of its annuity businesses. Services
revenue was driven by the strong annuity base, though performance was impacted
by a slowdown in small faster yielding projects and declines in longer-term
signings in 2008. Software revenue growth, when adjusted for currency, was
driven by continued demand for mission critical software. Systems and
Technology performance reflects the challenges that transaction-based
businesses are facing in the current economic environment. Within the segment,
the companys UNIX servers performed well. Global Financing revenue, when
adjusted for currency, resulted in financing and used equipment sales revenue
flat versus the prior year.
 
The
gross profit margin was 43.4 percent, an increase of 1.9 points, primarily due
to improvements in Global Technology Services (1.0 point of the increase),
Software (0.5 points of the increase) and Global Business Services (0.3 points
of the increase), partially offset by a decrease in Systems and Technology (0.3
points of decline).
 
Total
expense and other income decreased 9.5 percent for the first quarter of 2009
versus the first quarter of 2008. Overall, the decrease was driven by
approximately 9 points due to the effects of currency, acquisitions drove
approximately 3 points of growth and the companys operational expense improved
4 points year over year.
 
The
companys effective tax rate for the first three months of 2009 was 26.5
percent versus 27.5 percent in the first three months of 2008.
 
Total
assets decreased $7,579 million (decreased $5,382 million adjusted for
currency) from December 31, 2008, primarily due to lower total receivables
($5,240 million), total deferred taxes ($880 million) and cash and cash
equivalents ($447 million). The company had $12,295 million in cash and
marketable securities at March 31, 2009.
 
Total
liabilities decreased $7,687 million (decreased $5,915 million adjusted for
currency) from December 31, 2008, primarily due to lower total debt
($2,949 million), compensation and benefits ($1,255 million), retirement and
nonpension postretirement benefit obligations ($1,176 million), accounts
payable ($1,136 million) and taxes payable ($711 million).
 
Stockholders
equity of $13,693 million increased $108 million from December 31, 2008,
primarily due to higher retained earnings ($1,614 million), common stock ($301
million) and retirement-related items ($233 million), partially offset by
increased treasury stock ($1,977 million).
 
The
company generated $4,386 million in cash flow provided by operating activities,
an increase of $185 million, compared to the first quarter of 2008. Net cash
used in investing activities of $48 million was $5,730 million lower than the
first quarter of 2008, primarily due to the Cognos acquisition in 2008 and the
sale of core logistics operations to Geodis in the first quarter of 2009. Net
cash used in financing activities of $4,583 million was $1,787 million higher,
primarily due to increased net payments associated with debt ($1,605 million)
and lower receipts of cash from other common stock transactions ($723 million),
partially offset by lower payments to repurchase common stock ($662 million) in
the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008.
 
Global Services signings
were $12,535 million, a decrease of 0.6 percent year to year (increased 10
percent adjusted for currency). The estimated Global
Services backlog, as reported, ended at $126 billion, down $4 billion
(unchanged adjusted for currency) versus the December 31, 2008 balance.

Global
Services
 
The
Global Services segments, Global Technology Services (GTS) and Global Business
Services (GBS), had combined revenue of $13,152 million, a decrease of 9.8
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2009 compared
to the first quarter of 2008. Revenue was driven by the strong annuity base,
though performance was impacted by a slowdown in small faster yielding projects
and declines in long-term signings in 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, total
Global Services signings decreased 1 percent (increased 10 percent adjusted for
currency) to $12,535 million. Signings in the longer-term outsourcing
businesses were $6,991 million, an increase of 14 percent (27 percent adjusted
for currency). Shorter-term signings, which include Consulting and Systems
Integration and Integrated Technology Services, were $5,544 million, a decrease
of 14 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency). The company signed 16 deals
larger than $100 million in the quarter. The estimated Global Services backlog,
at actual currency rates was $126 billion at March 31, 2009, a decrease of
$4 billion (unchanged adjusted for currency) from the December 31, 2008
level. The Global Services segments leveraged very strong margin performance
and delivered combined pre-tax profit of $1,625 million in the first quarter of
2009, an improvement of 3.7 percent. Pre-tax margin increased 1.6 points to
11.8 percent. The Global Services business has continued to execute on cost and
expense actions consistent with the transformation of its business model.

Global Technology Services
revenue decreased 9.5 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) versus the
first quarter of 2008. Total signings in GTS increased 1 percent (13 percent
adjusted for currency) led by longer-term outsourcing signings growth of 8 percent
(22 percent adjusted for currency). Shorter-term signings decreased 16 percent
(7 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Strategic Outsourcing (SO)
revenue was down 9.4 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2009 versus the same period in 2008. SO signings in the first
quarter of 2009 increased 8 percent (23 percent adjusted for currency), led by
strength in North America, driven by Canada, and the growth markets. Strategic
Outsourcing remains a compelling value proposition to clients as it provides a
lower cost base and effective cost variability over the contract period.
 
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue decreased 7.0 percent (increased 1 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of
2008. ITS signings decreased 16 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency). In
the first quarter, efficiency offerings such as Optimization and Managed
Services continued to perform well, however, large end-user rollouts with high
OEM capital content began to decline. The shift in the portfolio to higher
value offerings and away from OEM content, although impacting revenue and
signings in the quarter, contributed to better gross profit margin performance.
 
Business Transformation
Outsourcing (BTO) revenue decreased 19.8 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) year to year, driven primarily by lower client business volumes in
North America and Europe. BTO signings increased 9 percent (19 percent adjusted
for currency).
 
Maintenance revenue
decreased 9.2 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of
2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. Services provided to Ricoh
InfoPrint Solutions in the first quarter of 2008, which in subsequent periods
transitioned to Ricoh, drove the majority of the decline.
 
Global Business Services
revenue decreased 10.5 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2009 compared with the prior year. While revenue in the growth
markets accelerated from performance in the second half of 2008, the major
markets were impacted by lower longer-term signings in 2008 and a deferral of
some contracts. Total signings in GBS decreased 2 percent (increased 6 percent
adjusted for currency) in the quarter. Longer-term application outsourcing
signings increased 44 percent (49 percent adjusted for currency) with growth in
both the major and growth markets. Within

the major markets, clients
continue to be primarily motivated by cost savings opportunities, while in the
growth markets, demand has been more balanced between cost savings and
infrastructure build-out initiatives. Within the shorter-term category of Consulting
and Systems Integration, signings decreased 13 percent (4 percent adjusted for
currency) in the quarter, with declines in the smaller contracts that impact
near-term revenue yield. Within total GBS signings, from a sector perspective,
declines in Industrial and General Business were partially offset by growth in
the Public and Communications sectors. Cost savings and efficiency offerings
continue to drive the majority of the demand in GBS.

GTS gross profit decreased 2.1 percent compared to the first quarter of
2008, with gross profit margin improving 2.6 points. All lines of business
delivered gross margin expansion in the quarter. Segment pre-tax profit
increased 11.7 percent to $1,104 million with a pre-tax margin of 12.1 percent,
an increase of 2.3 points versus the first quarter of 2008. This was the
seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit pre-tax profit growth. These margin
improvements were driven by a combination of greater mix to higher value
offerings, particularly in Integrated Technology Services where the key plays
are becoming a larger portion of the portfolio, and cost and expense management
driven by initiatives in standardization, global integration and improved
efficiency. The actions taken to improve efficiency provides the flexibility

Global Services
signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients
commitment under a Global Services contract. Signings are used by management to
assess period performance of Global Services management. There are no
third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings.
The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge
the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the
agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. For
example, for long-term contracts that require significant up-front investment
by the company, the portions of these contracts that are a signing are those
periods in which there is a significant economic impact on the client if the
commitment is not achieved, usually through a termination charge or the client
incurring significant wind-down costs as a result of the termination. For
short-term contracts that do not require
 
27





Table
of Contents
 
significant
upfront investments, a signing is usually equal to the full contract value.
Longer-term contracts represent SO and BTO outsourcing contracts as well as GBS
contracts with the U.S. Federal government and its agencies and Application
Management Services (AMS) for custom and legacy applications. Shorter-term contracts
represent the remaining GBS offerings of Consulting and Systems Integration
(C&SI), AMS for packaged applications and ITS contracts.
 
Signings include
SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are
treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value.
Maintenance is not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be
more steady state, where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes
SO, BTO, ITS, GBS and Maintenance. Backlog is intended to be a statement of
overall work under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations,
adjustments for revenue not materialized and currency assumptions used to
approximate constant currency.
 
Contract portfolios
purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments
provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial
signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is
signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

servers, driven by virtualization, increased efficiency and good returns on
client investments.
 
System
z revenue decreased 18.8 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter versus the prior year, while MIPS (millions of instructions per
second) volumes grew 18 percent year-to-year. This is the fifth consecutive
quarter of double-digit MIPS growth on the mainframe servers. MIPS from
specialty engines increased approximately 20 percent, driven by over 50 percent
growth in Linux MIPS. Revenue increased 37 percent (60 percent adjusted for
currency) in the companys growth markets, while the major markets were weak,
especially in Europe, as a result of a strong compare to the first quarter of
2008 when the company introduced its new mainframe product.
 
Converged
System p revenue decreased 1.8 percent (up 5 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008. The constant
currency revenue growth was driven by the high end (45 percent) and mid range
servers (8 percent), partially offset by low end servers (down 49 percent).

Across
the geographies, aggregate revenue from the countries comprising the companys
growth markets organization decreased 12.0 percent (increased 4 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2009 and represented
approximately 17 percent of the companys total geographic revenue. Adjusted
for currency, growth in these markets remained approximately 8 points higher
than in the major markets. Across the growth markets, revenue performance
reflected the diversity of the regions. While areas such as Central and Eastern
Europe and a few of the smaller Asia Pacific countries have been more
challenging, several of the larger countries are showing resiliency and good
growth. India revenue declined 9.6 percent, as reported, but increased 12
percent adjusted for currency. China revenue increased 14.2 percent (11 percent
adjusted for currency) reflecting continued strong demand for banking
infrastructure offerings and increasing demand for smarter planet solutions.
The company is continuing to target its investments to profitable growth areas,
capturing opportunities in these strategically important markets.
 
OEM
revenue decreased 33.7 percent (34 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2009 when compared to the first quarter of 2008, driven by reduced
demand in the Microelectronics OEM business.
 
Revenue
from the companys industry sales units decreased 11.0 percent (3 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted for currency,
revenue performance in the first quarter was led by Public sector revenue,
which decreased 2.5 percent as reported, but increased 6 percent, adjusted for
currency, with growth in all industries. Public sector signings were strong in
the quarter, increasing nearly 50 percent, adjusted for currency, and over 200
percent in the U.S. Government and education clients at the federal level are
focusing on investments to drive job creation, while state and local agencies
are looking for cost reduction through infrastructure and process
transformation. Healthcare clients are focused on cost reductions with strong
demand for outsourcing and transformational offerings. Financial Services
sector revenue decreased 10.1 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) in the
quarter. The companys value proposition around cost reduction and risk and
compliance remains a priority for Financial Services clients and market
consolidation is driving demand for integration projects. Communications sector
revenue decreased 9.5 percent (flat adjusted for currency). Clients are looking
for operating efficiencies and cost reduction and the companys offerings on
Intelligent Utility Network provide a strong entry for Smart Grid technology.
Distribution sector revenue decreased 13.9 percent (7 percent adjusted for
currency) and remains challenging in the major market countries. The growth
market countries had double digit revenue growth, adjusted for currency, in all
the Distribution sector industries as infrastructure for expansion is driving
investment. Industrial sector revenue declined 20.3 percent (15 percent
adjusted for currency) in the quarter and remains the most challenging as
clients are conserving cash and reducing capital spending to position for
recovery and long-term viability.

Total
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 6.3 percent
(up 2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2009 versus the
first quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by approximately 8 points due to
the impact of currency, partially offset by increased acquisition-related
spending which accounted for approximately 2 points. Workforce reductionsrelated
expense increased $170 million due to actions taken by the company in the first
quarter, primarily in the
services business. The company expects to spend between $300 million and $400
million globally related to workforce reductions for the full year 2009.  Bad debt expense increased $95 million driven
by additional specific accounts receivables provisions. The companys accounts
receivable provision coverage is 2.4 percent, an increase of 80 basis points
from a year ago and an increase of 40 basis points from year-end 2008.

Other
(income) and expense was income of $304 million in the first quarter of 2009
versus income of $125 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in
income was driven by the net gain ($298 million) reflected in Other in the
table above, recognized from the divestiture of the core logistics operations
to Geodis and improved foreign currency transaction impacts ($133 million)
versus the prior year. Interest income was lower ($109 million) reflecting the
current interest environment and the year-to-year impact related to securities
and investment assets ($77 million) reflects sales of Lenovo stock in the prior
year.
 
Overall
impact related to derivative instruments was a net expense of $49 million, $68
million higher than the prior year. Included within the foreign
currency hedging activity, the company hedges its major anticipated
cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility in its
global cash planning (the hedge of anticipated royalties and cost transactions
programs as discussed in Note 6), which also reduces volatility in the year-over-year
results.  The impact of these specific
hedging programs is primarily reflected in other (income) and expense, as well
as cost of goods sold.  The income from
these cash flow hedge programs reflected in other (income) and expense was $95
million, an increase of $199 million year to year.

The
decrease in interest expense was driven by lower debt and interest rates in the
first quarter of 2009 versus the comparable period of 2008. Interest expense is
presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings if the
related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external
business. See pages 45 and 46 for additional information regarding Global
Financing debt and interest expense. Overall, total interest for the first
quarter was $335 million, a decrease of $52 million year to year.

Included in the amounts
above, the company had income of $77 million and $100 million associated with
its defined benefit pension plans for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. This decline in income was primarily driven by increased amortization of actuarial losses due to 2008
financial market performance. The cost of defined
contribution plans decreased $42 million year over year. The net year-to-year
decrease in cost impacted gross profit, SG&A expense and RD&E expense
by approximately $19 million, $8 million and $2 million, respectively.
 
Acquired Intangible Asset Amortization
 
The company has been
investing in targeted acquisitions to increase its capabilities in high value

Taxes
 
The
effective tax rate for the first three months of 2009 was 26.5 percent versus
an effective tax rate of 27.5 percent for the first three months of 2008. The decline in the rate was primarily due
to an increase in tax credit benefits associated with the U.S. Research and
Experimentation Tax Credit.
 
With
limited exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
local or non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through
2002. The years subsequent to 2002 contain matters that could be subject to
differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates
to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 determined in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, increased by $130
million in the first quarter to $4,028 million. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate is $3,485 million at March 31, 2009.
 
The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2006 and 2007
in the first quarter of 2009.
 
The company has certain
foreign tax loss carryforwards that have not been reflected in the gross
deferred tax asset balance. These losses, the potential tax benefit of which is
approximately $1.2 billion, have not been recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position as the company has not determined if it will
claim these losses. The company is currently evaluating whether to claim these
losses.
 
See the 2008 IBM Annual Report, Note P, Taxes, on pages 99 to 101 for
additional information.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period.  Diluted earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the
period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares
include outstanding stock options, stock awards and convertible notes.

Actual
shares outstanding at March 31, 2009 were 1,321.4 million. The weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution was lower by 61.9 million
in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008, primarily
as a result of the companys common share repurchase program.

Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At
March 31, 2009, the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain
strong. Cash on hand at quarter end was $12,294 million. Total debt of $30,976
million decreased $2,949 million from prior year-end levels. The commercial
paper balance at March 31, 2009 was $837 million, up from $468 million at year
end, but the balance remains historically low. The company continues to have
substantial flexibility in the market. In the first quarter, the company
generated $4,386 million in cash from operations, an increase of $185 million
compared to the first quarter of 2008. The company has consistently generated
strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional
sources of liquidity though the capital markets and its $10 billion global
credit facility. The companys strong cash flow and substantial cash position
permits the company to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most
attractive long-term opportunities.
 
The
assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant
part of the companys financial position. The financial position amounts
appearing on pages 4 and 5 are the consolidated amounts including Global
Financing. The amounts appearing in the separate Global Financing section,
beginning on page 42, are supplementary data presented to facilitate an

Working
capital was essentially flat compared to the year-end 2008 position. The key
changes are described below:
 
Current
assets decreased $5,009 million, including a currency impact of $1,103 million,
due to:
 
·                  A decline of $4,092 million in short-term
receivables driven by:
 
·                  a decrease of $3,322 million primarily due to
collections of higher year-end balances, and
 
·                  approximately $770 million currency impact.
 
·                  A decrease of $612 million in cash and cash equivalents
and marketable securities including a $202 million currency impact (see cash
flow analysis on page 37).
 
Current
liabilities decreased $5,010 million, including a $778 million benefit from
currency, as a result of:
 
·                  A decrease in short-term debt of $1,366
million primarily driven by:
 
·                  $3,471 million in payments; partially offset
by
 
·                  reclasses of
$1,508 million from long-term to short-term debt to reflect maturity dates; and
 
·                  $664 million in new debt issuances and a $369
million increase in commercial paper.
 
·                  A decrease in compensation and benefits of
$1,255 million (including a currency benefit of $104 million) and a decrease of
$1,136 million (including a currency benefit of $158 million) in accounts
payable reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances;
 
·                  A decrease of $711 million in taxes payable
primarily due to income tax payments in the first quarter of 2009; and
 
36

Net
cash from operating activities increased $185 million as compared to the first
quarter of 2008 driven by the following key factors:
 
·                  An increase in cash provided by accounts
receivable of $262 million, driven by Global Financing receivables ($187
million) and non-Global Financing receivables ($75 million) due to lower
first-quarter 2009 revenue and improved collections;
 
·                  A U.S. Federal tax refund of $350 million
received in the first quarter; partially offset by
 
·                  Higher payments for workforce rebalancing of
$265 million; and
 
·                  Higher retirement-related funding for
non-U.S. plans of $246 million.
 
Net
cash used in investing activities decreased $5,730 million driven by:
 
·                  A decrease of $4,940 million in acquisitions
primarily driven by the acquisition of Cognos in 2008;
 
·                  A decrease in cash used in net capital
spending of $419 million driven by lower investments in the Strategic Outsourcing
and Microelectronics businesses; and
 
·                  An increase of cash from divestitures of $327
million as a result of the Geodis transaction in 2009.
 
Net
cash used in financing activities increased $1,787 million as a result of:
 
·                  Increase of $1,605 million in net cash
payments to settle debt;
 
·                  A decrease of $723 million in cash generated
by other common stock transactions primarily due to lower stock option
exercises; partially offset by
 
·                  Lower common stock repurchases of $662
million.

The
decrease in noncurrent assets of $2,570 million ($1,094 million due to
currency) was driven by:
 
·                  A decrease of $1,148 million in long-term
financing receivables ($275 million due to currency) driven by maturities
exceeding originations;
 
·                  A decrease of $747 million in noncurrent
deferred taxes ($165 million due to currency) primarily due to the expected
utilization of deferred taxes on the companys current year tax return; and
 
·                  A decrease of $578 million in plant, rental
machines and other property driven by currency ($276 million) and lower capital
spending.
 
Long-term
debt decreased $1,583 million primarily due to a reclass to short-term debt as
certain instruments approach maturity.
 
Other
noncurrent liabilities, excluding debt, decreased $1,094 million ($810 million
due to currency) primarily driven by:
 
·                  A decrease in
retirement and nonpension benefit obligations of $1,176 million ($628 million
due to currency) primarily driven by contributions to non-U.S. plans.
 
Debt
 
The
companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are
executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the
company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as
needed.

Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client
assets as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets,
primarily for Global Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams
similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these
Global Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing
asset base. The debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing
section on pages 45 and 46.
 
Given
the significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio
which excludes Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is
more representative of the companys core business operations. The companys
long-term core debt-to-capitalization ratio objective is 20 to 30 percent.
This ratio can vary from period to period as the company manages its global
cash and debt positions.
 
Core
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
42.4 percent at March 31, 2009 compared to 48.7 percent at December 31, 2008.
The reduction was primarily driven by the decrease in non-Global Financing debt
of $1,947 million from December 31, 2008 balances.
 
Consolidated
debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2009 was 69.3 percent versus 71.4
percent at December 31, 2008.

Table of Contents
 
Equity
 
Stockholders
equity increased $108 million primarily as a result of an increase in retained
earnings of $1,614 million and an increase of $301 million in common stock,
partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $1,977 million, driven by
the companys common stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Looking Forward
 
The company delivers value to its clients
through the following three strategic priorities, which are described more
fully in the 2008 IBM Annual Report on pages 20 and 21, under the section
entitled Strategy:
 
·        Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value
Solutions
·        Deliver Integration and Innovation to
Clients
·        Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise
 
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in over 170 countries, with
approximately 65 percent of its 2008 revenue and 63 percent of its first
quarter 2009 revenue generated outside the U.S. This global reach gives the
company access to markets, with well-established organizations and management
systems that understand the clients and their challenges and that can respond
to these opportunities with value-add solutions. The companys transformation
to a globally integrated enterprise provides the capabilities to service
clients globally and deliver the best skills and cost from anywhere in the
world.
 
In emerging markets, the company will continue to
invest for revenue growth by capturing new infrastructure spending in these
markets. While these economies have slowed, these markets still offer good
growth opportunities relative to the rest of the world.
 
The company has developed a strong value proposition
for the established markets based on cost reduction, capital conservation and
risk management. The high value, integrated offerings, including green data
centers, outsourcing and virtualization on high-end systems, have performed
well in these markets in the current environment.
 
Looking forward, the companys Smarter Planet
strategy will provide an important new opportunity to deliver value to clients.
The company anticipates a significant opportunity in smart infrastructure
projects as governments around the world implement economic stimulus programs
focused on next generation smart grids, healthcare-related information
technology and broadband. Projects of these types require technology
integration and industry insight which should uniquely position the company to
participate in these opportunities.
 
Two other key initiatives that the company is
investing in are business analytics and cloud computing. Business analytics
leverages the companys capabilities to optimize its clients business
performance by applying analytics to their business processes. Cloud computing
is an emerging model for delivering and consuming IT-enabled services. Each of
these three opportunities require enterprise software, deep industry process
knowledge and solution integration capabilities  all key strengths of the
company.
 
The company remains committed to technology leadership
and will continue to focus internal investments, complemented with strategic
acquisitions, on high-value, high-growth opportunities. The company invested
over $6 billion in RD&E in 2008 and approximately $30 billion over the past
five years.
 
In addition, the companys financial position is
strong. Through its efficient cash generation business model based on
disciplined balance sheet management, in 2008, the company generated $18.8
billion in operating cash flow and had $12.3 billion in cash and marketable
securities at March 31, 2009. This provides the company with the financial
flexibility for investments in changing business environments. The company will
also continue to focus on cost and expense reduction and improved efficiency.
In 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009, those efforts translated to margin
expansion and the company expects this to continue for the balance of the year.
 
In May 2007, the company met with investors and analysts and discussed a
road map to deliver earnings per share in 2010 in the range of $10 to $11 per
share, or 14 to 16 percent compound growth rate from 2006. The companys 2010
roadmap is comprised of two key components. First, the 2010 roadmap includes
generating earnings per share in the range of $9 to $10 per share, or 10 to 14
percent growth from 2006 through a combination of operational elements including
revenue growth, margin improvement, growth initiatives, acquisitions and
effective capital deployment to fund growth and provide
 
39





Table of Contents
 
returns to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. In
addition to these operational elements, the companys roadmap to the $10 to $11
per share range includes the projected benefit of retirement-related costs based
on December 31, 2006 assumptions. Actual retirement-related costs will depend
on several factors including financial market performance, the interest rate
environment and actuarial assumptions. In March 2008, the company met again
with investors and analysts and discussed the progress the company is making on
its 2010 roadmap.
 
In January 2009, the company disclosed that it was projecting earnings per
share of at least $9.20 per diluted share for the full year 2009, primarily
driven by margin improvement. In April 2009, the company reiterated its
projection of at least $9.20 per diluted share for 2009. In addition, as the
company continues to execute its strategy and maintains its focus on delivering
profit and cash over the longer term, it believes that it is ahead of pace of
attaining its 2010 roadmap.
 
The companys performance in the first quarter highlighted the benefits of
its global reach and the strength of its business model. The financial results
reflected solid progress on major elements of the long-term goals, however, the
company measures the success of its business model over the long term, not any
individual quarter or year. The companys strategies, investments and actions
are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
 
The company is a proven infrastructure provider of IT technology. The
companys broad product and services portfolio delivers value to clients 
through a combination of services, hardware and software. The portfolio is
focused on high-value solutions that can deliver measurable benefit to clients
with offerings that can address a wide scope of client issues including: energy
savings, security and resiliency, risk management and cost reduction among many
others.
 
The company remains committed to technology leadership and will continue to
focus internal investments, complemented with strategic acquisitions, on
high-value, high-growth opportunities.
 
The continued investments in Software have led to this segments emergence
as a strong source of revenue growth and the largest contributor to the companys
profit in 2008 and 2007. The Software business is differentiated in the
industry by both the strength of its individual products and the breadth of the
software offerings. Clients continue to rely on the extensive middleware
portfolio to help them transform their business, streamline costs and seek new
business opportunities. The key to continued Software growth stems from the
ability to maintain and grow this industry-leading software business, and by
continuing to capitalize on industry trends. Investments will be aligned to
advance the companys growth strategy through new client acquisition, with
specific focus on key industries and local businesses. The company will also
continue to focus on expanding its software capabilities through a combination
of internal development and strategic acquisitions.
 
Within the Global Services business, combined profit improved in the first
quarter driven by gross margin and pre-tax margin expansion. The company
continues to see the results of the targeted actions it has taken to transform
the services business model and continued to execute on cost and expense
actions consistent with that transformation in the first quarter. The Global
Services business enters the second quarter with strong executional momentum
and a revenue backlog of $126 billion, an increase of $1 billion from the prior
year, adjusted for currency. The company continues to evolve and adapt its
offerings to meet the changing needs for its clients. A key example is the new
Business Analytics and Optimization service line within GBS which will draw on
the full scope of the companys capabilities to solve clients business
problems. The company expects to see benefit from its first quarter actions in
margin improvement for the remainder of the year, and also expects the Global
Services business to deliver double-digit profit growth in the second quarter.
 
In the Systems and Technology business, the company will focus its
investments on differentiating technologies with high-growth potential
including POWER, high-performance computing, virtualization, nanotechnology and
energy efficiency. In this market, the value has shifted to the
high end to address clients needs to consolidate and virtualize their
environments. The company will focus on providing clients with a clear path to
a fully dynamic infrastructure that not only reduces cost, but is both
intelligent and secure.
 
The company expects 2009 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be
approximately $1.4 billion, essentially flat compared to 2008. This estimate
reflects current pension plan assumptions. For the period ending March 31,
2009, the estimated return on assets for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (U.S.
Plan) was (8) percent and (6) percent for all worldwide defined benefit plans.
See the companys 2008 Annual Report Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, on pages
106 to 116 for additional information.

Table of Contents
 
The company expects in the normal course of business that its effective tax
rate in 2009 will be approximately 26.5 percent. The rate will change period to
period based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax
audits, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income
before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and
local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At March 31, 2009, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at
year-end 2008. The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to
limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in the 2008 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 90 to 94.
 
In the first quarter of
2009, the companys
revenue declined 11.4 percent as reported and 3.8 percent adjusted for
currency, driven from the companys operations in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. The company maintains currency hedging programs for cash planning
purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency
impacts on the companys financial results. In addition to the translation of
earnings, the impact of currency changes also may affect the companys pricing
and sourcing actions. For example, the company may procure components and
supplies in multiple functional currencies and sell products and services in
other currencies. The company believes that some of these currency-based
changes in cost impacts the price charged to clients. Therefore, it is
impractical to precisely quantify the impact of currency on these transactions
and on consolidated net income. However, the company estimates that the maximum
effect of currency, before taking pricing or sourcing actions into account, and
net of hedging activity, negatively impacted total diluted earnings per share
growth by approximately $0.08 in the first-quarter 2009.
 
For
non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign
Currency Translation. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these
entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by
entering into foreign currency hedge contracts.
 
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
In
the companys 2008 Annual Report, on pages 45 to 47, there is a discussion
of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of
data. The table presented on page 45 includes net cash from operating
activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global
credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the three months ended,
or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2009, those amounts are $4.4 billion
for net cash from operating activities, $12.3 billion of cash and marketable
securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The
major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at March 31,
2009 appear in the table below and remain unchanged from December 31,
2008. The company has no contractual arrangements that, in the event of a
change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its
financial position or liquidity.

The
table appearing on page 46 of the 2008 Annual Report presents the format
in which management reviews cash flows for each of the past five years and is
accompanied by a description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and
reviewed. While the company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, on page 6
of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events underlying sources and
uses of cash in that format on page 37, the following is the management
view of cash flows for the first quarter of 2009 and 2008 prepared in a manner
consistent with the table and description on page 46 of the 2008 Annual
Report:

Free
cash flow for the first quarter increased $450 million versus the first quarter
of 2008. The improvement year to year was primarily driven by lower capital
expenditures. Also, in the quarter, $2,440 million was returned to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases.
 
Events
that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above
and in the 2008 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results,
material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 13 on pages 19
to 21 of this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make legally mandated
pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1,100 million
in 2009.  The company is not quantifying
any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict
future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.
 
Global Financing
 
Global Financing is a
reportable segment that is measured as if it were a standalone entity.
Accordingly, the information presented in this section is consistent with this
separate company view. The mission of Global Financing is to facilitate clients
acquisition of IBM hardware, software and services with the objective of
generating consistently strong returns on equity.

The decrease in revenue,
in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2008, was primarily due
to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 8.5 percent (flat
adjusted for currency), due to decreases in financing revenue (down 9.1 percent
to $450 million) and used equipment sales revenue (down 6.5 percent to $129
million); partially offset by
 
42





Table
of Contents
 
·                  Growth in internal revenue of 0.9 percent driven by an
increase in equipment sales to the System and Technology segment (up 25.2
percent to $228 million), offset by a decrease in internal financing revenue
(down 20.8 percent to $161 million).
 
The decrease in external
and internal financing revenue was primarily due to lower average asset
balances.
 
Global Financing gross
profit increased 5.4 percent compared to the same period in 2008, with gross
margin increasing 6.1 points. This was due to higher margins on both financing
and used equipment sales.
 
Global Financing pre-tax
income decreased 7.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 versus the same
period in 2008. The decline was primarily driven by an increase of $76 million
in financing receivables provisions, partially offset by the increase in gross
profit of $31 million and a decrease in other selling, general and administrative
expense of $21 million.
 
Global Financing return
on equity was essentially flat year over year.

  page 46.



 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The
primary use of funds in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial
financing assets. Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware,
software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment,
software and services to meet IBM clients total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for equipment as well as loans for
hardware, software and services with terms generally from two to seven years.
Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services and are
unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis in order to
mitigate the associated risk and, when deemed necessary, covenants are put into
agreements to protect against deterioration during the life of the obligation.
Client financing also includes internal activity as described on page 53
of the 2008 IBM Annual Report.
 
43





Table of Contents
 
Commercial
financing receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable
financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts receivable financing
generally range from 30 to 90 days. 
These short-term receivables are primarily unsecured and are also
subject to additional credit actions in order to mitigate the associated risk.
 
Approximately 97 percent of Global Financings
external financing assets are in the segments core competency of technology
equipment and solutions financing. At March 31, 2009, approximately 60
percent of the external portfolio is with investment grade clients with no
direct exposure to consumers or mortgage lending institutions.

Cash
collections of both commercial and client financing receivables exceeded new
financing originations in both the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, which
resulted in a net decline in total financing assets for these periods. The
decrease in originations was due to a lower demand for IT equipment associated
with the current economic environment.
 
Cash
generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany
payables and dividends to IBM.

recoveries, which were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents
translation adjustments.
 
The
percentage of financing receivables reserved increased from 2.0 percent at December 31,
2008, to 2.3 percent at March 31, 2009 primarily due to the decline in the
gross financing receivables balance from December 31, 2008, and the
increase in the specific allowance for doubtful accounts.  Specific reserves increased 5.4 percent from
$386 million at
 
44





Table
of Contents
 
December 31, 2008 to
$407 million at March 31, 2009. Unallocated reserves decreased $15 million
from $144 million at December 31, 2008 to $129 million at March 31,
2009 due to the decline in gross financing receivables.
 
Global
Financings bad debt expense was an increase of $71 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2009, compared with a reduction of $5 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2008. The increase in bad debt expense was
attributed to the growth in specific reserves.
 
Residual Value
 
Residual
value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at
lease inception.  Global Financing has
insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global Financing
optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of
lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements
with current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from
equipment returned at end of lease, represented 36.9 percent of Global
Financings revenue in the first quarter of 2009 and 31.4 percent in the first
quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in internal
used equipment sales to the Systems and Technology segment and the decrease in
financing revenue. The gross margin on these sales was 49.9 percent and 44.2
percent in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase was
driven primarily by higher margin internal sales.
 
The
following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for
sales-type and direct financing leases and operating leases at December 31,
2008 and March 31, 2009. In addition, the table presents the residual
value as a percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of
when the unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31,
2009 is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. The residual value guarantee
increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining the classification
of a lease as a sales-type lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values
associated with the guarantees were $106 million and $198 million for the
financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2009
and March 31, 2008, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed
future values at the scheduled end of lease were $6 million and $12 million for
the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31,
2009 and March 31, 2008, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $0.8
million and $1.7 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and March 31,
2008, respectively.

Table of Contents
 
intercompany loans are set
by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying the
financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt
are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 43.
 
The
Global Financing business provides funding predominantly for the companys
external clients but also provides intercompany financing for the company. As
previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as
if it were a standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to
debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is
included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 42 and in
Segment Information on page 52.
 
In
the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, however, the
external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal
financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest
expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on total company debt.
In this table, intercompany activity is comprised of internal loans and leases
at arms length pricing in support of Global Services long-term contracts and
other internal activity. The company believes these assets should be
appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business
model.

Looking Forward
 
Global Financings
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financings
assets and new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services
financed to the companys clients and business partners, and substantially all
financing assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business
for future growth.
 
46





Table
of Contents
 
The companys System z
and high-end converged System p servers announced in 2008 continue to be a
significant financing opportunity. Global Financings offerings are competitive
and available to clients as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access
to the capital markets. Overall, Global Financings originations will be
dependent upon the demand for IT products and services as well as client
participation rates.
 
IBM continues to access
both the short-term commercial paper market and the medium and long-term debt
markets.  A protracted period where IBM
could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in originations.
 
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact
the credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore
the level of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 45,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both
through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its
remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each
of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with product
and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business
going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the economy.
