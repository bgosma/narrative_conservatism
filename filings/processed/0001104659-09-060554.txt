Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation:  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto are
unaudited.  In the opinion of the
management of the International Business Machines Corporation (the company),
these statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring
nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results
may be different. See the companys 2008 Annual Report for a discussion of the
companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should
be read in conjunction with the companys 2008 Annual Report.
 
The company evaluated subsequent events through October 27,
2009, the date the companys Board of Directors reviewed the financial
statements to be issued. The company issued the financial statements on the
same day.
 
Within the financial tables in this Form 10-Q,
certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for
disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying
whole-dollar amounts.
 
2.
Accounting Changes:  In October 2009, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended revenue recognition guidance
for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The new guidance eliminates the
residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of managements best
estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor
specific objective evidence (VSOE), vendor objective evidence (VOE) or
third-party evidence (TPE) is unavailable. For the company, this guidance is
effective for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or
after January 1, 2011 with earlier application permitted as of the
beginning of a fiscal year. Full retrospective application of the new guidance
is optional. The company is currently assessing its implementation of this new
guidance, but does not expect a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which
amends the scope of existing software revenue recognition accounting. Tangible
products containing software components and non-software components that
function together to deliver the products essential functionality would be
scoped out of the accounting guidance on software and accounted for based on
other appropriate revenue recognition guidance. 
For the company, this guidance is effective for all new or materially
modified arrangements entered into on or after January 1, 2011 with
earlier application permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year. Full
retrospective application of the new guidance is optional. This guidance must
be adopted in the same period that the company adopts the amended accounting
for arrangements with multiple deliverables described in the preceding
paragraph. The company is currently assessing its implementation of this new
guidance, but does not expect a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
In September 2009, the FASB issued amended
guidance concerning fair value measurements of investments in certain entities
that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). If fair value is
not readily determinable, the amended guidance permits, as a practical
expedient, a reporting entity to measure the fair value of an investment using
the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) provided by the investee
without further adjustment.  The
amendments are effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15,
2009. The company does not expect a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements due to the adoption of this amended guidance.
 
In August 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the
measurement of liabilities at fair value. The guidance provides clarification
that in circumstances in which a quoted market price in an active market for an
identical liability is not available, an entity is required to measure fair value
using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of an identical
liability when traded as an asset or, if unavailable, quoted prices for similar
liabilities or similar assets when traded as assets. If none of this
information is available, an entity should use a valuation technique in
accordance with existing fair valuation principles. The company adopted this
guidance in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and there was no material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
On July 1, 2009,
the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification).
The Codification became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S.
GAAP, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA), Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) and related literature.
The Codification eliminates the previous US GAAP hierarchy and establishes one
level of authoritative GAAP. All other literature is considered
non-authoritative. The Codification was effective for interim and annual
periods ending after September 15, 2009.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
 
The company adopted the
Codification for the quarter ending September 30, 2009. There was no
impact to the consolidated financial results as this change is disclosure-only
in nature.
 
In June 2009,
the FASB issued amendments to the accounting rules for variable interest
entities (VIEs) and for transfers of financial assets. The new guidance for
VIEs eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing
qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary.
In addition, qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) are no longer exempt
from consolidation under the amended guidance. The amendments also limit the
circumstances in which a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset,
should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire
original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the
transferor in the financial statements being presented, and/or when the
transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. The
company will adopt these amendments for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning on January 1, 2010. The company does not expect the adoption of
these amendments to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
In May 2009,
the FASB issued guidelines on subsequent event accounting which sets forth: 1)
the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting
entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential
recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; 2) the circumstances
under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after
the balance sheet date in its financial statements; and 3) the disclosures that
an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the
balance sheet date. These guidelines were effective for interim and annual
periods ending after June 15, 2009, and the company adopted them in the
quarter ended June 30, 2009. There was no impact on the consolidated
financial results.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of
activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased, and in
identifying transactions that are not orderly. Based on the guidance, if an
entity determines that the level of activity for an asset or liability has
significantly decreased and that a transaction is not orderly, further analysis
of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the
transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. The
guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim and annual periods
ending after June 15, 2009. The company adopted this guidance in the
quarter ended June 30, 2009, and there was no material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued guidance on the recognition and presentation of
other-than-temporary impairments on investments in debt securities. If an
entitys management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell a debt
security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the
security before recovery of its cost basis, then an entity may separate
other-than-temporary impairments into two components: 1) the amount related to
credit losses (recorded in earnings), and 2) all other amounts (recorded in
other comprehensive income). This guidance was effective on a prospective basis
for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The company
adopted this guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and there was
no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued additional requirements regarding interim disclosures about the
fair value of financial instruments which were previously only disclosed on an
annual basis. Entities are now required to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments which are not recorded at fair value in the financial statements in
both their interim and annual financial statements. The new requirements were
effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 on a
prospective basis. The company adopted these requirements in the quarter ended June 30,
2009. There was no impact on the consolidated financial results as this relates
only to additional disclosures. The required disclosures are included in Note
4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, on page 11.
 
On January 1,
2009, the company adopted the revised FASB guidance regarding business
combinations which was required to be applied to business combinations on a
prospective basis. The revised guidance requires that the acquisition method of
accounting be applied to a broader set of business combinations, amends the definition
of a business combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an
acquirer to recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition
date and requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination
to be measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date
(with limited exceptions). There was no impact upon adoption and the effects of
this guidance will depend on the nature and significance of business
combinations occurring after the effective date. See Note 11, Acquisitions /
Divestitures on pages 25 and 26 for further information regarding 2009
business combinations.

In April 2009,
the FASB issued an amendment to the revised business combination guidance
regarding the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination that arise from contingencies. The requirements of this
amended guidance carry forward without significant revision the guidance on
contingencies which existed prior to January 1, 2009. Assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are
recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated. If fair
value cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liability would generally be
recognized in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
450 on contingencies. There was no impact upon adoption. See Note 11,
Acquisitions / Divestitures on pages 25 and 26 for further information
regarding 2009 business combinations.
 
In April 2008,
the FASB issued new requirements regarding the determination of the useful
lives of intangible assets. In developing assumptions about renewal or
extension options used to determine the useful life of an intangible asset, an entity
needs to consider its own historical experience adjusted for entity-specific
factors. In the absence of that experience, an entity shall consider the
assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension
options. The new requirements apply to intangible assets acquired after January 1,
2009. The adoption of these new rules did not have a material impact on
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In December 2007,
the FASB issued new guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated
financial statements. This guidance requires that the noncontrolling interest
in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides
revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the
noncontrolling interest and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and
requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the
interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the
transition provisions, the company adopted this new guidance on January 1,
2009 via retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure
requirements. Noncontrolling interests of $119 million at December 31,
2008 were reclassified from the Liabilities section to the Stockholders Equity
section in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of January 1,
2009.
 
Noncontrolling
interest amounts of $1 million and $(3) million, net of tax, for the three
months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, respectively,
and $4 million and $11 million, net of tax, for the nine months ended September 30,
2009 and September 30, 2008, respectively, are not presented separately in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings due to immateriality, but are reflected
within the other (income) and expense line item.
 
In March 2008,
the FASB issued new disclosure requirements regarding derivative instruments
and hedging activities. Entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on an
interim and annual basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives; how
derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivatives and
related hedged items affect the entitys financial position, financial results
and cash flow. Pursuant to the transition provisions, the company adopted these
new requirements on January 1, 2009. The required disclosures are
presented in Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on pages 12
to 19 on a prospective basis. These new requirements do not impact the
consolidated financial results as they are disclosure-only in nature.
 
The
FASB guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures became effective January 1,
2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date
regarding fair value measurements and disclosures of nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to January 1,
2009. The adoption of these provisions related to nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact
on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In June 2008,
the FASB issued guidance in determining whether instruments granted in
share-based payment transactions are participating securities. The guidance
became effective on January 1, 2009 via retrospective application.
According to the new guidance, unvested share-based payment awards that contain
non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating
securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share (EPS)
pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per
share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to
dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in
undistributed earnings. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees
prior to December 31, 2007 are considered participating securities as they
receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalents at the same rate as common stock.
RSUs granted after December 31, 2007 do not receive dividend equivalents
and are not considered participating securities. The company retrospectively
adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The impact of adoption decreased
previously reported diluted EPS

by $0.01 for the
third-quarter 2008 and by $0.03 for the nine months ended September 30,
2008. Previously reported basic EPS decreased by $0.01 for the third-quarter
2008 and by $0.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.
 
In November 2008,
the FASB issued guidance on accounting for defensive intangible assets. A
defensive intangible asset is an asset acquired in a business combination or in
an asset acquisition that an entity does not intend to actively use. According
to the guidance, defensive intangible assets are considered to be a separate
unit of account and valued based on their highest and best use from the
perspective of an external market participant. The company adopted this
guidance on January 1, 2009, and there was no impact upon adoption.
 
In December 2008,
the FASB issued guidance regarding employers disclosures about postretirement
benefit plan assets. This guidance requires more detailed disclosures about the
fair value measurements of employers plan assets including: (a) investment
policies and strategies; (b) major categories of plan assets; (c) information
about valuation techniques and inputs to those techniques, including the fair
value hierarchy classifications (as defined in the Codification) of the major
categories of plan assets; (d) the effects of fair value measurements
using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets; and (e) significant
concentrations of risk within plan assets. The disclosures required by this
guidance will be included in the companys year ending 2009 Consolidated Financial
Statements. There is no impact on the consolidated financial results as the
guidance is disclosure-only in nature.

Position at December 31, 2008 are $773 million and $1,117 million,
respectively.
(3)          The gross balances of
derivative liabilities contained within other accrued expenses and liabilities,
and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31,
2008 are $1,414 million and $702 million, respectively.
 
At September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, the company did not have any financial assets
or financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.
 
Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Nonrecurring Basis
 
In the
fourth quarter of 2008, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment
of $81 million for an equity method investment. The resulting investment which
was classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy was valued using a
discounted cash flow model. The valuation inputs included an estimate of future
cash flows, expectations about possible variations in the amount and timing of
cash flows and a discount rate based on the risk-adjusted cost of capital.
Potential results were assigned probabilities that resulted in a weighted
average or most-likely discounted cash flow fair value as of December 31,
2008. The fair value of the investment after impairment was $7 million at December 31,
2008. During the first nine months of 2009, the balance of this investment was
further reduced by an additional impairment of $5 million and other adjustments
primarily related to dividends. The balance of this investment was zero at September 30,
2009.
 
4.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, debt and marketable equity
securities and derivative financial instruments are recognized and measured at
fair value in the companys consolidated financial statements. Notes and other
accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying
values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses
and short-term debt are financial liabilities with carrying values that
approximate fair value. In the absence of quoted prices in active markets,
considerable judgment is required in developing estimates of fair value.
Estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could
realize in a current market transaction. The following methods and assumptions
are used to estimate fair values:
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
Estimates
of fair value are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest
rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the
same remaining maturities.
 
Long-term Debt
 
Fair
value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for
the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other
long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected
present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair
value. The carrying amount of long-term debt is $20,583 million and $22,689
million and the estimated fair value is $22,338 million and $23,351 million at September 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases is for leases that
relate principally to the companys systems products and are for terms ranging
generally from two to six years. Net investment in sales-type and direct
financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of $868 million and $916
million at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively,
and is reflected net of unearned income of $962 million and $1,049 million and
of allowance for doubtful accounts of $179 million and $217 million at those
dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables relate to loans that are provided by Global
Financing primarily to the companys clients to finance the purchase of the
companys software and services. Separate contractual relationships on these
financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally from two to seven years.
Each financing contract is priced independently at competitive market rates.
The company has a history of enforcing the terms of these separate financing
agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $260 million and $373 million at September 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008.
 
6. Derivatives and Hedging Transactions: The company operates in multiple
functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global
markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact
of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser
extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company
limits these risks by following established risk management policies and
procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective,
financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For
interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements
between the interest rates associated with the companys lease and other
financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt.
Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the
company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will
fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit
risk, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully
selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other
factors. The companys established policies and procedures for mitigating
credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits
for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of
counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these
arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the
 
12





Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
 
arrangement to net amounts due to and from the
counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of
counterparty default. The company is
also a party to collateral security arrangements with certain
counterparties.  These arrangements require
the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when
the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting
thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or
credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair
value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent
features that were in a liability position at September 30, 2009 was $906
million for which the company has posted collateral of $217 million. Full
overnight collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event
that the companys credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit
default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the
terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in
net asset positions as of September 30, 2009 was $890 million. This amount
represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date as a result of the
counterparties failing to perform as contracted. This exposure is reduced by
$707 million of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those
counterparties.  The company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master
netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon
payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related
derivative instruments. At September 30, 2009, the company recorded $269
million in cash collateral related to all applicable derivative instruments in
prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.
 
The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge
the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency
exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect
to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges,
expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash
flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by the translation of the
underlying hedged equity. The company monitors the cash loss potential on an
ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by
de-designating the derivative instrument to manage this liquidity risk.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize
derivatives to offset the changes in fair value of the de-designated
instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity. The company
expended $111 million and $414 million related to maturities of derivative
instruments that existed in qualifying net investment hedge relationships in
the three months and nine months ending September 30, 2009, respectively.
At September 30, 2009, the company had net assets of $66 million,
representing the fair value of derivative instruments in qualifying net
investment hedge relationships. The weighted-average remaining maturity of
these instruments at September 30, 2009 was approximately two years. In
addition, at September 30, 2009, the company had net liabilities of $439
million representing the fair value of derivative instruments that were
previously designated in qualifying net investment hedging relationships but
were de-designated prior to September 30, 2009; of this amount $173
million is expected to mature over the next twelve months. The notional amount
of these instruments at September 30, 2009 was $3,736 million including
original and offsetting transactions.
 
In its hedging programs, the company uses forward
contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and cross-currency swaps,
depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged
derivative instruments.
 
A brief description of the major hedging programs,
categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings
 
The company issues debt in the global capital markets,
principally to fund its financing lease and loan portfolio. Access to
cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the
underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest
cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt
issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific
variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At September 30,
2009, the total notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps was $7,917
million.
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on
forecasted debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use forward
starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments
related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to
this program outstanding at September 30, 2009.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net
Investment)
 
A significant portion of the companys foreign
currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment
to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign
currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign
subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses
cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk
management purpose. At September 30, 2009, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1,000 million.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
The companys operations generate significant
nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments
for royalties and goods and services among the companys non-U.S. subsidiaries
and with the parent company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash
flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company
selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency
risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows is approximately four years. At September 30,
2009, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow
hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $20,405 million with a
weighted-average remaining maturity of 1.3 years.
 
Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
The company is exposed to
exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this
risk, the company
employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated
debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing
entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At September 30,
2009, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow
hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $300 million.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency
Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage
the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to
convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses
foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the
foreign currency exposure of a portion of the companys nonfunctional currency
assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are
generally less than two years. The changes in the fair values of these
contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and
are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. At September 30, 2009, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $10,740
million.
 
Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to equity price changes
principally related to certain obligations to employees. These equity exposures
are primarily related to market price movements in certain broad equity market
indices and in the companys own stock. Changes in the overall value of these
employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes equity derivatives,
including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related
to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the
total return on certain broad equity market indices or the total return on the
companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value with gains or losses
also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At
September 30, 2009, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of equity risk was $753 million.

Other Risks
 
The company holds warrants to purchase shares of
common stock in connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives
because they contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The amount of
shares to be purchased under these agreements was immaterial at September 30,
2009. The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in
other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The company is exposed to a potential loss if a client
fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company utilizes credit
default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures. These derivatives
have terms of one year or less. The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains
and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement
of Earnings. The company does not have any derivative instruments relating to
this program outstanding at September 30, 2009.
 
The following tables provide a quantitative summary of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
 
At September 30, 2009, in connection with cash
flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company
recorded net losses of $1,335 million (before taxes), in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss). Of this amount, $718 million of losses are
expected to be reclassified to net income within the next twelve months,
providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated
transactions. At September 30, 2009, net losses of
approximately $19 million (before taxes), were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the companys
borrowings. Of this amount, $9 million of losses are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next twelve months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying transactions.
 
For the nine months ending September 30, 2009,
there were no significant gains or losses recognized in earnings representing
hedge ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
(for fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying exposure that did not
or was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor are there any
anticipated in the normal course of business.
 
Refer to the 2008 IBM Annual Report, Note A,
Significant Accounting Policies on pages 73 and 74 for additional
information on the companys use of derivative instruments.
 
7. Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based
compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service period.  The following table presents total
stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings:

The
reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended September 30,
2009, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was
principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants ($39 million), partially offset by an
increase related to restricted and performance-based stock units ($26
million).  The reduction in pre-tax
stock-based compensation cost for the nine months ended September 30,
2009, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was
principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants ($128
million), partially offset by an increase related to restricted and
performance-based stock units ($44 million).
 
As of September 30,
2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,139 million related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately three years.
 
There were no significant capitalized stock-based
compensation costs at September 30, 2009 and 2008.
 
8. Segments:  The following tables reflect the results of
the companys reportable segments consistent with the management system used by
the companys chief operating decision maker. These results are not necessarily
a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP. For example, employee retirement
plan costs are developed using actuarial assumptions on a country-by-country
basis and allocated to the segments based on headcount.  Different results could occur if actuarial
assumptions that are unique to the segments were used. Performance measurement
is based on income before income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are
used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in
allocating resources to, each of the segments.

The company received a
$14.8 million subsidy in the third quarter and $34.3 million for the first nine
months of 2009 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by the company
to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the remainder is
contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the participants.
For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see pages 115
and 116 in the companys 2008 Annual Report.
 
11.
Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
Acquisitions: During the nine months ended September 30,
2009, the company completed three acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $60
million.
 
The
Software segment completed acquisitions of three privately held companies: in
the second quarter, Outblaze Limited and Exeros, Inc.; and in the third
quarter, Ounce Labs, Inc. Purchase price consideration was paid all in
cash. These acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
The
table below reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the
resulting purchase price allocations as of September 30, 2009:

The acquisitions were accounted for as purchase
transactions, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired
entities were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. The primary items that generated the goodwill are the value of the
synergies between the acquired companies and IBM and the acquired assembled
workforce, neither of which qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. The
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 5.0 years. With the exception of goodwill, these identified
intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
lives. Goodwill of $54 million has been assigned to the Software segment.
Substantially all of the goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

Divestitures: On March 16, 2009, the company
completed the sale of certain processes, resources, assets and third-party
contracts related to its core logistics operations to Geodis. The company
received proceeds of $365 million and recognized a net gain of $298 million on
the transaction in the first quarter of 2009. The gain was net of the fair
value of certain contractual terms, certain transaction costs and related real
estate charges. As part of this transaction, the company outsourced its
logistics operations to Geodis which enables the company to leverage
industry-leading skills and scale and improve the productivity of the companys
supply chain.
 
In 2007, the company divested 51 percent of its
printing business (InfoPrint) to Ricoh. The company also stated that it would
divest its remaining ownership to Ricoh quarterly over a three year period from
the closing date. At September 30, 2009, the companys ownership in
InfoPrint was 12.1 percent. See the companys 2008 Annual Report on page 83
for additional information.

Other intangibles are
  primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business processes,
  methodologies and systems, and impacts from currency translation.



 
The net carrying amount
of intangible assets decreased $443 million during the first nine months of
2009, primarily due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. The aggregate
intangible amortization expense was $313 million and $931 million for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively, versus $331 million and
$985 million for the third quarter and first nine months ended September 30,
2008, respectively. In addition, in the first nine months of 2009, the company
retired $668 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the
gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
 
The amortization expense
for each of the five succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be
the following at September 30, 2009:

14.
Contingencies:  The company is involved in a variety of
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including actions
with respect to contracts, intellectual property (IP), product liability,
employment, benefits, securities, foreign operations and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, partners, clients, current or former employees, government and
regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which
the company does business.
 
The following is a summary of the more significant
legal matters involving the company.
 
The company is a
defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake
City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to
Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of
AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify

and focus the issues in the case and to expedite their
resolution. Motions for summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the
court has not yet issued its decision. On August 10, 2007, the court in
another suit, The SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., issued a decision
and order determining, among other things, that Novell is the owner of UNIX and
UnixWare copyrights, and obligating SCO to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs
claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. At the
request of the court in SCO v. IBM, on August 31, 2007, each of the
parties filed a status report with the court concerning the effect of the August 10th
Novell ruling on the SCO v. IBM case, including the pending motions. On September 14,
2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this
case were stayed. In the SCO v. Novell case, on November 25, 2008, SCO
filed its notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,
which included an appeal of the August 10, 2007 ruling; on August 24,
2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the August 10, 2007 ruling and
remanded the SCO v. Novell case for trial. 
Novells motion for rehearing en banc is pending.  On August 25, 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware approved the appointment of a Chapter 11
Trustee of SCO.
 
On November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit
against Platform Solutions, Inc. (PSI) in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, alleging that PSI violated certain
intellectual property rights of IBM. PSI asserted counterclaims against IBM. On
January 11, 2008, the court permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI
computer systems, to intervene as a counterclaim-plaintiff. T3 claimed that IBM
violated certain antitrust laws by refusing to license its patents and trade
secrets to PSI and by tying the sales of its mainframe computers to its
mainframe operating systems. On June 30, 2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a
result of this transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed all claims against each
other, and PSI withdrew a complaint it had filed with the European Commission
in October 2007 with regard to IBM. On September 30, 2009, the court
granted IBMs motion for summary judgment and dismissed T3s claims against
IBM.  This decision is subject to
appeal by T3. In January 2009,
T3 filed a complaint with the European Commission alleging that IBM violated
European Commission competition law based on the facts alleged in the
above-referenced U.S. litigation.  IBM has been
notified that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating possible
antitrust violations by IBM.  The DOJ has
requested certain information, including the production of materials from the
litigation between T3 and IBM.
 
The company and certain of its subsidiaries were
defendants in an action filed on August 17, 2007 in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by JuxtaComm Technologies, Inc.,
which alleged that certain IBM products infringe a patent relating to the
transformation and exchange of data between different computer systems.
JuxtaComm sought damages.  In
October 2009, the parties settled the matter and the action was dismissed.

 
In January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors
Office in South Korea announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges
against several companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture
between IBM Korea and LG Electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective
January, 2005) and had also charged employees of some of those entities with,
among other things, bribery of certain officials of government-controlled
entities in Korea and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with
authorities in these matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM
Korea and LG IBM employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM
Korea and LG IBM were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed
at different times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of
issuance, which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter. In March 2008,
the company received a request from the SEC for additional information.
 
The company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought
in Tokyo District Court by Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover
losses that it allegedly suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil
rehabilitation (bankruptcy) proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo
Leasing amounts for which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others
liable. The claims in this suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in
the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages
in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.

The company is party to, or otherwise involved in,
proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA),
known as Superfund, or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require
potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities
regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting
environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity
of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits,
administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental
agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or
former operating sites.
 
The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations
and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other
U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various
challenges with Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and
non-income tax litigation matters. These matters include claims for taxes on
the importation of computer software. In November 2008, the company won a
significant case in the Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax
court in Brazil, and in late July 2009, the company received written
confirmation regarding this decision. 
The total potential amount related to the remaining matters for all
applicable years is approximately $600 million. The company believes it will
prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of
liability.
 
The
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are
reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the
impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other
information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities,
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended September 30,
2009, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its
experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters
previously referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential
liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters
previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend itself
vigorously, it is possible that the companys business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period
by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally
determined in any such claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could
reasonably have a material effect on the companys business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of
variables, including the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the
structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any
such losses, damages or remedies may have on the Consolidated Financial
Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter
which may give rise to additional factors.
 
15. Commitments: 
The companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include
unused amounts of $4,322 million and $4,403 million at September 30, 2009
and December 31, 2008, respectively. A portion of these amounts was
available to the companys business partners to support their working capital
needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to
its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately
$2,758 million and $3,342 million at September 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively.
 
The company has applied
the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees,
even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 
The company is a party to
a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the
other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise
in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the
company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising
from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title
to the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified
environmental matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual
obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment
by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically
allow the company to challenge the other partys claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the companys
payment, the companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in
terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.

It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had
a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.
 
In addition, the company
guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential
future payment under these financial guarantees was $86 million and $50 million
at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The fair
value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position is not material.

16. Subsequent Events: On October 27, 2009, the company
announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55
per common share. The dividend is payable December 10, 2009 to stockholders
of record on November 10, 2009. In addition, on October 27, 2009, the
company announced that the Board of Directors authorized $5 billion in
additional funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase program.
 
On October 26, 2009, the
company announced that it had signed an agreement with Dassault Systems (DS)
under which DS would acquire the companys activities associated with sales and
support of DSs product lifecycle management (PLM) software solutions,
including customer contracts and related assets. This transaction is subject to
customary closing conditions and is not expected to close until the first half
of 2010. The company expects to record a gain when this transaction is completed.
 
On October 5, 2009,
the company announced that it had signed an agreement with Bank of America
Corporation to acquire the core operating assets of Wilshire Credit
Corporation, including the Wilshire mortgage servicing platform. This
acquisition continues the companys strategic focus on the mortgage services
industry and strengthens its commitment to deliver mortgage business process
outsourcing solutions. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions
and is not expected to close until the first quarter of 2010.
 
On October 2, 2009,
the company completed the acquisition of SPSS, Inc., a publicly-held
company, for cash consideration of approximately $1.2 billion. This acquisition
strengthens the companys business analytics and optimization strategy by
providing predictive analytic capabilities that can help customers predict
future events and proactively act upon that insight. SPSS will be integrated
into the companys Information Management software portfolio.
 
On October 1, 2009,
the company completed the divestiture of its UniData and UniVerse software
products and related tools to Rocket Software, a privately-held global software
development firm.

Within the Management
Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at constant
currency are made so that the financial results can be viewed without the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of the companys business performance.
 
In the third quarter, in a challenging global economic environment, the
company continued to deliver value to its clients, and strong financial results
to its investors  with profit growth driven by continued margin expansion,
market share gains in software and hardware driving improved revenue
performance and a continuing strong cash position.
 
Since the beginning of the decade, the company has been moving out of
commoditizing businesses while investing in higher value areas  which drives a
more profitable mix. In addition, a focus on the global integration of the
company improves productivity and efficiency. The transformational changes to
the business have reduced the companys fixed cost base and improved the
operational balance point. The strong profit and cash base funds the
investments to expand the companys base of opportunity in the future and
return capital to shareholders. Key areas of investment include Smarter Planet
solutions, business analytics and new compute models such as cloud computing.
The strategic transformation of the business has allowed the company to deliver
strong performance in this environment and to position the business for the
future  with a better business profile and a more competitive cost structure.
 
In the quarter, the company delivered $2.40 in diluted
earnings per share, an increase of 17.6 percent year to year. Total revenue
decreased 6.9 percent as reported, 5.0 percent adjusted for currency. Revenue
increased sequentially versus the second quarter and the revenue growth rate
improved 1.8 points, adjusted for currency, compared to the prior quarter.
Pre-tax income of $4,373 million increased 12.3 percent, with pre-tax margin
increasing 3.2 points due to improvements in gross margin and expense. Net
income margin improved 2.5 points versus the third quarter of 2008, benefiting
from an improved tax rate. The companys ongoing common share repurchases drove
a lower share balance contributing to the improvement in diluted earnings per
share.

Table of Contents
 
Third quarter revenue
growth was impacted by currency and the economic environment, but the companys
ability to deliver value to customers, its significant base of recurring
revenues and its ability to increase share in a competitive market, resulted in
improved revenue performance compared to the second quarter. Software was led by
share gains in WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli and Rational which
drove revenue growth for key branded middleware, which increased 5 percent,
adjusted for currency. Share gains in hardware drove an improvement in the
Systems and Technology revenue growth rate, which was 11 points better than the
prior quarter, adjusted for currency.
 
On
a segment basis, Global
Technology Services revenue declined 4.4 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency), Global Business Services 11.5 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) reflecting the challenges in the more economically-sensitive
consulting business, Software 2.6 percent (essentially flat adjusted for
currency), Systems and Technology 11.6 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) and Global Financing 15.4 percent (13 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Geographic revenue decreased 6.9 percent (5 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter. Revenue growth, adjusted for
currency, improved versus the second quarter in every geography: Americas + 2.5
points, EMEA + 0.5 points, and Asia Pacific + 0.2 points. Revenue from the
major market countries decreased 7.0 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency),
however, performance improved 2 points, adjusted for currency, compared to the
second quarter. Revenue from the companys growth markets decreased 6.2 percent
as reported, and decreased 1 percent adjusted for currency. Overall, the growth
markets delivered 19 percent of total geographic revenue in the quarter, with
growth, adjusted for currency, 5 points higher than the major markets.
 
The gross profit margin of 45.1 percent increased 1.8
points year to year driven by improved margins in Global Services and Software
and an improved revenue mix driven by Software. Overall, Global Technology
Services drove 1.0 points, Global Business Services 0.4 points and Software 0.6
points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin, offsetting lower
margins in Systems and Technology and Global Financing.
 
Total expense and other income decreased 11.5 percent
(7 percent adjusted for currency) for the third quarter of 2009 versus the
third quarter of 2008. Overall, the decrease was driven by approximately 8
points due to the companys focus on expense management and 5 points due to the
effects of currency, offset by 1 point due to acquisitions.
 
The companys effective tax rate for the third quarter
of 2009 was 26.5 percent versus 27.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008.
 
The company generated $5,197 million in cash flow
provided by operating activities, an increase of $1,459 million, compared to
the third quarter of 2008, primarily driven by increased net income ($390
million) and changes in operating assets and liabilities ($934 million). Net
cash used in investing activities of $2,337 million was $841 million higher
than third quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased investments in
marketable securities and other investments in 2009 ($1,102 million), partially
offset by decreases in acquisitions ($101 million) and net capital spending ($135
million). Net cash used in financing activities of $5,167 million was $3,286
million higher, compared to the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to an
increase in net payments associated with debt ($5,007 million), partially
offset by lower payments to repurchase common stock ($1,744 million).
 
Third-quarter 2009 Global Services signings were
$11,809 million, a decrease of 6.8 percent year to year (7 percent adjusted for
currency). The company signed 13 deals larger than $100 million in the third
quarter of 2009. The estimated Global Services backlog, as reported, was $134
billion at September 30, 2009, up $3 billion versus the June 30, 2009
balance (down $2 billion adjusted for currency) and up $5 billion (up $1
billion adjusted for currency) versus the September 30, 2008 balance.

For the first nine months of 2009, total revenue
decreased 10.6 percent as reported, 5.3 percent adjusted for currency, versus
the prior year. Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $11,757 million,
a 7.8 percent increase compared to the first nine months of 2008. Diluted earnings
per share from continuing operations was $6.42, reflecting a 13.6 percent
improvement year to year. The key drivers of performance in the third quarter 
the companys ongoing transformation, shift to higher value areas and margin
expansion  were the primary contributors to the strong profit improvement in
the first nine months of 2009.
 
Revenue growth for the
first nine months of 2009 was impacted by currency and the continuing weak
economic environment. Global Services revenue was supported by the annuity
base. The Software business continued to perform well, led by the key branded
middleware products and the significant base of recurring revenues. Systems and
Technology performance reflects the challenges that transaction-based
businesses are facing in this environment.
 
On
a segment basis, Global
Technology Services revenue declined 7.9 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency), Global Business Services 12.4 percent (8 percent adjusted for
currency), Software 5.4 percent (essentially flat adjusted for currency),
Systems and Technology 20.6 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) and
Global Financing 11.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Geographic revenue for the first nine months of 2009
decreased 10.3 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) versus the same period
of 2008. Revenue from the companys growth markets decreased 9.7 percent
(increased 1 percent adjusted for currency) and revenue from the major markets
decreased 10.4 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency).
 
For the first nine months of 2009, the gross profit
margin of 44.7 percent increased 2.0 points versus the prior year driven by
improved margins in Global Services and Software and an improved revenue mix
driven by Software. Overall, Global Technology Services drove 1.0 points,
Global Business Services drove 0.3 points and Software 0.7 points of
improvement in the consolidated gross margin, offsetting margin declines in
Systems and Technology and Global Financing.

Total expense and other
income decreased 13.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) for the first
nine months of 2009 versus the first nine months of 2008. Overall, the decrease
was driven by approximately 8 points due to the effects of currency and 7
points due to the companys focus on expense management, partially offset by increased
acquisition-related spending which accounted for approximately 1 point.
 
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of
2009 was 26.8 percent versus 27.5 percent for the comparable period in 2008.
 
Total assets decreased $5,848 million (decreased
$9,665 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2008, primarily
due to lower total receivables ($4,886 million), cash and cash equivalents
($3,210 million), total deferred taxes ($638 million) and intangible assets
($443 million), partially offset by increased marketable securities ($1,814
million), prepaid pension assets ($1,111 million) and goodwill ($1,046
million). The company had $11,512 million in cash and marketable securities at September 30,
2009.
 
Total liabilities decreased $10,757 million (decreased
$12,827 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2008, primarily
due to lower total debt ($8,457 million), retirement and nonpension
postretirement benefit obligations ($1,025 million) and accounts payable ($869
million).
 
Stockholders equity of $18,493 million increased
$4,909 million from December 31, 2008, primarily due to higher retained
earnings ($6,459 million), equity translation adjustments ($1,678 million) and
common stock ($1,353 million), partially offset by increased treasury stock
($4,240 million).
 
In the first nine months of 2009, the company generated
$14,325 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of
$2,134 million, compared to the first nine months of 2008, primarily driven by
increased net income ($705 million) and changes in operating assets and
liabilities ($1,911 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,234
million was $4,171 million lower than the first nine months of 2008, primarily
due to the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions in 2008 and the sale of the core
logistics operations to Geodis in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities
of $13,494 million was $4,530 million higher, primarily due to an increase in
net payments associated with debt ($7,629 million) and lower receipts of cash
from other common stock transactions ($2,156 million), partially offset by
lower payments to repurchase common stock ($5,472 million) in the first nine
months of 2009 versus the first nine months of 2008.

Global Services
 
The Global Services segments, Global Technology
Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS) had combined revenue of
$13,772 million, a decrease of 6.7 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in
the third quarter and $40,370 million, a decrease of 9.4 percent (4 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2009, respectively, when
compared to the same periods of 2008. Services revenue performance was
supported by its annuity revenue base, but also reflected the challenges in the
more economically sensitive consulting business. In the third quarter, total
Global Services signings of $11,809 million decreased 6.8 percent (7 percent adjusted
for currency) year over year. The company signed 13 deals larger than $100
million in the third quarter. In addition, the company signed three deals in
the first two days of October with a total value of approximately $1
billion. Signings in the outsourcing businesses were $6,671 million, an
increase of 1.4 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). Consulting and
Systems Integration and Integrated Technology Services signings were $5,138
million, a decrease of 15.7 percent (15 percent adjusted for currency). The
estimated Global Services backlog at actual currency rates was $134 billion at September 30,
2009, an increase of $3 billion (decrease of $2 billion adjusted for currency)
from the June 30, 2009 level and $5 billion ($1 billion adjusted for currency)
year to year. The Global Services segments drove a combined pre-tax profit of
$2,131 million in the third quarter and $5,770 million in the first nine months
of 2009, an improvement of 11.4 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively, versus
the same periods of 2008. Pre-tax margins expanded 2.4 points to 14.9 percent
in the third quarter and 2.7 points to 13.7 percent in the first nine months.
The Services business is improving margin by focusing on a competitive cost
structure while delivering value and quality to customers.

Global Technology Services revenue decreased 4.4
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and 7.9 percent (2 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively,
versus the third quarter and first nine months periods of 2008. Total
third-quarter signings in GTS decreased 10.6 percent (10 percent adjusted for
currency) with outsourcing signings down 9.9 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) and Integrated Technology Services signings down 12.2 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency).
 
Strategic Outsourcing (SO) revenue decreased 3.7
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and 7.3 percent
(1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2009,
respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. Revenue continues to be impacted
by reduced volumes in the existing client base. SO signings in the third
quarter of 2009 decreased 11.0 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency).
Signings for the first nine months increased 8.0 percent (17 percent adjusted
for currency) year over year and will add to the revenue base over a longer
period of time.
 
Integrated Technology Services (ITS) revenue decreased
5.3 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and 7.5
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2009 when
compared to the same periods in 2008. The ITS business continues to shift its
product portfolio to higher value, higher margin offerings. Revenue performance
largely reflects several quarters of signings declines in the OEM offerings
which support capital intensive product rollouts. The shift to higher margin
standardized offerings, and away from OEM content, leads to an improved gross margin
performance. ITS signings in the third quarter decreased 12.2 percent (12
percent adjusted for currency) year to year.
 
Business Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue
decreased 10.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter
and 16.0 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) for the first nine months of
2009 and reflects declines in client business volumes driven by a slower
economic environment, and an increased focus on driving profitability in BTO.
BTO signings increased 0.9 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter.
 
Maintenance revenue decreased 2.7 percent (flat
adjusted for currency) and 7.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively, versus the prior
year periods. When excluding the Ricoh InfoPrint services, which were provided
through the first five months of 2008 prior to the transition to Ricoh,
maintenance revenue for the first nine months of 2009 increased 2 percent,
adjusted for currency.
 
Global Business Services revenue decreased 11.5
percent (11 percent adjusted for currency) and 12.4 percent (8 percent adjusted
for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively,
versus the prior year periods. Economic conditions continue to impact GBS
revenue and signings performance.  Total
signings in GBS decreased 1.2 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter. Consulting and Systems Integration signings decreased 18.1
percent (18 percent adjusted for currency), although North America signings
increased 20 percent. Application Outsourcing signings increased 42.3 percent
(39 percent adjusted for currency) with strong growth in both the major and
growth markets. Application Outsourcing can provide clients with compelling
cost savings by reducing application maintenance costs and legacy application
costs.

GTS delivered
strong gross profit contribution across all lines of business. Gross profit
margins improved 2.8 points and 2.9 points in the third quarter and nine month
periods, respectively. Segment pre-tax profit increased 23.8 percent to $1,471
million in the third quarter and margin improved 3.4 points to 15.0 percent
over third-quarter 2008. Segment pre-tax profit in the first nine months
increased 25.5 percent to $3,980 million, with a pre-tax margin of 14.0
percent, an improvement of 3.8 points year to year. This was the ninth consecutive
quarter of double-digit pre-tax profit growth in GTS. This sustained margin
performance continues to be driven by the structural changes made in service
delivery and a shift to higher value offerings in Integrated Technology
Services. Global delivery, tools and automation, Lean process techniques,
hardware and software optimization and subcontractor efficiency all contributed
to productivity improvements.
 
GBS gross profit
margins improved 1.3 points and 1.4 points in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2009, respectively. GBS delivered better than balanced pre-tax
profit, though down 8.9 percent to $659 million in the third quarter and down
7.8 percent to $1,789 million in the first nine months of 2009. As a result,
pre-tax margins improved 0.5 points to 14.5 percent and 0.7 points to 13.0
percent in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively. In a tough
environment the GBS business continues to be supported by a very dynamic
delivery model. The global delivery infrastructure and framework includes
expanding global delivery capabilities, scalable subcontractor management and
improved resource deployment models. These capabilities have enabled GBS to
drive improved cost and expense management, lower subcontractor spending, and
improved utilization in the delivery centers and the overall business.

Global Services signings are managements initial
estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a Global Services
contract. Signings are used by management to assess period performance of
Global Services management. There are no third-party standards or requirements
governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management
involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment,
including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of
termination charges or wind-down costs.
 
Signings include SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts.
Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the
extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in signings as
maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal
renewals.
 
Backlog includes SO, BTO, ITS, GBS and Maintenance.
Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and
therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and
are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope
of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized
and currency factors used to approximate constant currency.
 
Contract portfolios
purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments
provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed
incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Software
revenue decreased 2.6 percent (flat adjusted for currency) and 5.4 percent
(flat adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2009, respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. The Software business has
continued to perform well in a difficult economic environment, driven by strong
demand for the Key Branded Middleware products. In the third quarter,
WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli and Rational all increased market
share.
 
Key Branded Middleware revenue increased 2.5 percent
(5 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2009 and decreased
1.3 percent (increased 5 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine
months of 2009, when compared to the same periods in 2008. Key Branded
Middleware is the fastest growing portion of the software portfolio and
accounted for 57 percent of total Software revenue in the third quarter, up 3
points from third-quarter 2008. As middleware becomes a larger percentage of
total software revenue, this improves the overall software revenue growth rate.
The companys broad portfolio of products has a strong value proposition in
this environment. Products which deliver a fast return-on-investment, like
WebSphere Portal and Tivoli Storage, grew a combined 8 percent in the third
quarter, adjusted for currency. Transformational offerings, including Cognos
and Information Integration, had double-digit revenue growth in the third
quarter, adjusted for currency.

WebSphere Family revenue
increased 14.3 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) and 9.3 percent (16
percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of
2009, respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. Application Servers, which
provide customers with a secure and resilient infrastructure for
mission-critical business applications, grew 14 percent in the third quarter
and 6 percent in the first nine months, adjusted for currency. Business Integration
software, which includes the ILOG acquisition, grew over 30 percent, adjusted
for currency, in both the third quarter and nine month periods. These two
solutions are key components of the WebSphere offering.
 
Information Management
revenue was flat (increased 3 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and decreased 3.7 percent (increased 2 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first nine months of 2009, respectively, versus the third quarter and
first nine months of 2008. Cognos and InfoSphere software, two key components
of the business analytics offerings, which enable continuous and extremely fast
analysis of massive volumes of data, both had double-digit revenue growth in
the quarter, adjusted for currency.
 
Lotus revenue decreased
9.5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) and 11.9 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009,
respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. Lotus continued to be impacted
by a softening in demand driven by customer consolidations and downsizing.
 
Tivoli revenue increased
5.3 percent and 0.8 percent (8 percent and 7 percent adjusted for currency)
year over year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009,
respectively, driven by growth in the systems and storage product areas.
Enterprise asset management software grew over 25 percent in the quarter and is
a key component of the Smarter Planet offerings.
 
Rational revenue increased 2.4 percent (5 percent
adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and 2.5 percent (9 percent adjusted
for currency) in the first nine months of 2009, respectively, versus the
comparable prior year periods. Rationals integrated software tools improve the
speed, quality and efficiency for customers with software development projects.
Telelogic revenue contributed to the growth in the first nine months of 2009 and
extended the brands reach into the systems development market opportunity.
 
Revenue from Other middleware decreased 4.1 percent
and 7.0 percent (1 percent and 1 percent adjusted for currency) in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2009, respectively.
 
Operating systems product
revenue decreased 12.3 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) and 10.1
percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2009, respectively, reflecting declining hardware sales in all system
brands.

Software
gross profit decreased 1.5 percent to $4,381 million for the third quarter and
4.5 percent to $12,639 million for the first nine months of 2009, driven
primarily by declining revenue. Gross profit margins expanded 0.9 points in
both the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, versus the prior
year periods. Software delivered pre-tax profit growth of 21.2 percent in the
third quarter of 2009 and 17.5 percent in the first nine months of 2009,
compared to the same periods of 2008. The pre-tax profit margin expanded 6.2
points to 32.1 percent and 6.0 points to 30.2 percent in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2009, respectively. The breadth of the software portfolio,
the strong recurring revenue stream and expense productivity combined to

months of 2009 versus the
third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively. High-end server
revenue decreased 10 percent and 3 percent, for the same periods. Although revenue
has declined, the company has continued to gain market share in the midrange
and high end of the product line by helping clients increase efficiency in
their data centers by leveraging consolidation and virtualization results.
Overall, the company gained 5 points of market share in the brand in the third
quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of share gains. In addition, in the

displacements to over $150 million, and to more than $400 million for the first
nine months of 2009.
 
System x revenue
increased 0.6 percent and declined 17.2 percent (increased 2 percent
and declined 14 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2009, respectively, versus the third quarter and first nine
months of 2008. System x server revenue increased 1 percent and declined 16
percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 versus the

of 2009 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, respectively.
System x share improved 2 points in the third quarter, the third consecutive
quarter of share gains. The companys improved sales model and enhanced product
set were the key contributors to the third quarter performance.
 
System
Storage revenue decreased 13.3 percent and 17.7 percent
(13 percent and 14 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2009 versus the comparable periods in 2008. Total disk
revenue decreased 10 percent and 15 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and
the first nine months of 2009 versus the third quarter and first nine months of
2008, respectively. These decreases were driven by declines in midrange disk
revenue of 3 percent and 27 percent for the third quarter and first nine months
of 2009 and decreased Enterprise Disk revenue of 21 percent and 14 percent for
the same periods, respectively, versus the third quarter and first nine months
of 2008. The companys storage acquisitions, XIV and Diligent, had strong
performance. XIV added over 65 new customers in the third quarter and over 275
new clients since the acquisition.  Tape
revenue declined 21 percent and 23 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and the
first nine months of 2009 versus the comparable periods of 2008, respectively.
 
Microelectronics
OEM revenue decreased 1.0 percent and 20.1 percent (1 percent and 20 percent
adjusted for currency), respectively, for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2009 versus the comparable periods of 2008, respectively, a
significant improvement over recent performance. The primary mission of this business is to provide

nanometer ramp.
 
Retail
Stores Solutions revenue decreased 15.3 percent and 32.5 percent (14 percent
and 28 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2009 versus the same periods in 2008, respectively, reflecting
continued weakness in the retail sector.

The decreases in external
gross profit for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 versus the
same periods of 2008 were primarily driven by lower revenue.
 
Overall, gross margin in
the third quarter decreased 0.6 points versus the prior year. Margin
improvements in System x, System z and System Storage were offset by the
impacts of product mix. The gross margin for the first nine months decreased
1.7 points compared to the first nine months of 2008. Margin improvements in
System x, System z and converged System p were offset by impacts of product mix
and margin declines in Microelectronics OEM and System Storage.
 
Systems and Technologys
pre-tax income decreased 20.6 percent in the third quarter, and 29.2 percent
for the first nine months when compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin
decreased 0.7 points in both the third quarter and first nine months,  versus the prior year periods.

In the first nine months of
2009, the company continued to execute its operational plan to increase process
efficiency and productivity; leveraging the companys scale and global
presence. The companys efforts have been focused on all areas of the business 
from sales efficiency, supply chain management and service delivery to the
global support functions. The companys cost and expense base (approximately
$90 billion) provides ample opportunity for savings and the company is on track
to yield approximately $3.5 billion in savings in 2009. The companys
initiatives have contributed to an improved operational balance point and the
current year improvements in profit and margin. As a result, the company is
able to continue to invest in capabilities that will differentiate the company
in the future and accelerate the development of new market opportunities.

Total Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expense decreased 11.2 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the
third quarter of 2009 versus the third quarter of 2008.  Overall, the decrease was driven by
reductions in operational expense (down 9 points) as the company continues to
focus on disciplined expense management, while investing for future growth.
Currency impacts also drove a year-to-year decline (down 3 points), partially
offset by acquisition-related spending (up 1 point). Bad debt expense decreased $152 million
primarily driven by lower accounts receivable balances in 2009 versus 2008,
resulting from lower revenue. The companys accounts receivable provision
coverage is 2.2 percent, an increase of 20 basis points from a year ago and
from year-end 2008.
 
Total SG&A expense decreased 12.3 percent
(6 percent adjusted for currency) in the first nine months of 2009 versus the
first nine months of 2008. The decrease was driven by reductions in operational
expense (down 7 points) and currency impacts (down 6 points), partially offset
by acquisition-related spending (up 1 point). Workforce reduction expense increased $77 million
primarily due to actions taken by the company in the first quarter, primarily
in the services business. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily driven
by the decline in third quarter of 2009 as described above.

Other
(income) and expense was expense of $5 million and income of $51 million in the
third quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in income in the
third quarter was primarily driven by higher foreign currency transaction losses ($68 million),
lower interest income ($66 million) and the reduction of income from securities
and investment assets ($99 million) primarily relating to sales of Lenovo stock
in the prior year ($51 million). These decreases in income were partially
offset by higher gains on derivative instruments of $223 million, primarily
driven by net gains on derivative instruments which primarily hedge foreign
currency risks as discussed in Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions,
on pages 12 to 19. Included within the foreign currency hedging activity,
the company hedges its major anticipated cross-border cash flows to mitigate
the effect of currency volatility in its global cash planning (the hedge of
anticipated royalties and cost transactions programs as discussed in Note 6, Derivatives
and Hedging Transactions, on pages 12 to 19), which also reduces
volatility in the year-over-year results. 
The impact of these specific hedging programs is primarily reflected in
other (income) and expense, as well as cost of goods sold.  The income from these cash flow hedge
programs reflected in other (income) and expense was $6 million, a reduction in
expense of $52 million year to year.
 
Other
(income) and expense was income of $326 million and $201 million for the first
nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in income for the
first nine months of 2009 was primarily driven by higher gains on derivative instruments ($413 million)
as discussed above, and the net gain ($298 million) reflected in Other in the
table above, recognized from the divestiture of the core logistics operations
to Geodis in the first quarter. These items were partially offset by lower
interest income ($233 million), the increase in expense related to securities
and investment assets ($246 million), which reflects the reduction of income
relating to sales of Lenovo stock in the prior year ($162 million), and the provision for losses related to a joint venture
investment ($119 million) recorded in the second quarter, also reflected in Other in the table above.

Taxes
 
The effective tax
rate for the third quarter of 2009 was 26.5 percent versus an effective tax
rate of 27.5 percent for the third quarter of 2008. The decline in the rate was
primarily due to an increase in tax credit benefits.  The corresponding effective tax rates for the
first nine months of 2009 and 2008 were 26.8 percent and 27.5 percent,
respectively.  The decline in the rate
was primarily due to an increase in tax credit benefits, partially offset by
the loss of the tax benefit associated with the joint venture loss provision.
 
With limited exception,
the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2002. The years
subsequent to 2002 contain matters that could be subject to differing
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the
amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the
outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate
amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.
 
The
company has certain foreign tax loss carry-forwards that have not been
reflected in the gross deferred tax asset balance due to the level of
uncertainty associated with the sustainability of the losses which are under
examination by the local taxing authority. The tax benefit of these losses
approximated $965 million at the end of the third quarter. If the tax loss
carry-forwards are subsequently utilized, recognition of the tax loss benefit
will be made, including any associated liability under the provisions of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
 
In addition, during the
second-quarter, foreign tax losses were utilized against a prior year tax
liability resulting in a cash benefit of approximately $360 million. However,
the company has recorded an unrecognized tax benefit provision given the degree
of uncertainty in sustaining the associated tax benefit.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2008, increased by $751 million in the first nine months to
$4,650 million.  The amount of
unrecognized tax benefits increased by $137 million during the third quarter of
2009. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
favorably affect the effective tax rate is $4,081million at September 30,
2009.
 
The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2006
and 2007 in the first quarter of 2009.

Actual shares
outstanding at September 30, 2009 was 1,313.6 million. The
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during
the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 was 45.8 million and
57.6 million lower than the same periods in 2008 primarily as a result of
the companys common share repurchase program.
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At September 30,
2009, the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. Cash
and marketable securities at quarter end was $11,512 million. Total debt of
$25,468 million decreased $3,904 million in the third quarter and $8,457
million from prior year-end levels. In the first nine months of 2009, the
company generated $14,325 million in cash from operations, an increase of
$2,134 million compared to the first nine months of 2008. The company has
consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have
access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its
$10 billion global credit facility. The companys strong cash flow and
substantial cash position permits the company to invest and deploy capital to
areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.
 
The assets and debt

key changes are described below:
 
Current
assets decreased $5,558 million, including a currency benefit of $1,438
million, due to:
 
·                  A decline of $3,932 million in short-term receivables driven by:
 
·                  a decrease of $4,892 million primarily due to collections of higher
year-end balances, partially offset by approximately $960 million of currency
benefit.
 
·                  A decrease of $1,395 million in cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities (see cash flow analysis on page 54).
 
·                  A decrease of $366 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets
primarily resulting from:
 
·                  a decrease of $623 million in derivative assets primarily due to
changes in foreign currency rates; and
 
·                  a decrease of $255 million in prepaid taxes driven by a U.S. Federal
tax refund of $350 million received in the first quarter; partially offset by
 
·                  an increase of approximately $186 million in prepaid and deferred
services transition costs.
 
Current
liabilities decreased $9,475 million, including an $866 million impact from
currency, as a result of:
 
·                  A decrease in short-term debt of $6,351 million primarily driven by:
 
·                  $10,760 million in payments to settle debt; partially offset by
 
·                  reclasses of $2,232 million from long-term to short-term
debt to reflect maturity dates; and
 
·                  $2,336 million in new debt issuances.
 
·                  A decrease of $876 million in other accrued expenses and liabilities
primarily due to:
 
·                  a decrease of $463 million in workforce reduction accruals reflecting
cash payments made; and
 
·                  a decrease in derivative liabilities of $253 million driven by changes
in foreign currency rates.
 
·                  A decline in accounts payable of $869 million, taxes of $530 million
and compensation and benefits of $313 million reflecting declines from
typically higher year-end balances.

Net
cash from operating activities increased $2,134 million as compared to the
first nine months of 2008 driven by the following key factors:
 
·                  An increase in cash provided by accounts receivable of $1,899 million,
driven by Global Financing receivables ($1,579 million) and non-Global
Financing receivables ($320 million) due to lower 2009 revenue;
 
·                  A tax refund of approximately $360 million in the second quarter
resulting from foreign tax losses utilized against a prior year tax liability;
 
·                  A U.S. Federal tax refund of $350 million received in the first
quarter; partially offset by
 
·                  Higher payments for workforce rebalancing of $436 million; and
 
·                  Higher retirement-related funding for non-U.S. plans of $407 million.
 
Net
cash used in investing activities decreased $4,171 million driven by:
 
·                  A decrease of $5,892 million in acquisitions primarily driven by the
acquisition of Cognos in 2008;
 
·                  A decrease in cash used in net capital spending of $829 million driven
by a decline in rental additions and lower investments in the Strategic
Outsourcing and Microelectronics businesses; and
 
·                  An increase in cash from divestitures of $335 million as a result of
the Geodis transaction in 2009; partially offset by
 
·                  The net impact of purchases and sales of marketable securities and
other investments that resulted in a use of cash of $1,918 million in the
current year in comparison to a source of cash in 2008 of $1,046 million.
 
Net
cash used in financing activities increased $4,530 million as a result of:
 
·                  Increase of $7,629 million in net cash payments to settle debt;
 
·                  A decrease of $2,156 million in cash generated by other common stock
transactions primarily due to lower stock option exercises; partially offset by
 
·                  Lower common stock repurchases of $5,472 million.

The decrease in noncurrent assets of $291 million,
including a currency benefit of $2,379 million, was driven by:
 
·                  A decrease of $954 million in long-term financing receivables driven by
maturities exceeding originations;
 
·                  A decrease of $929 million in noncurrent deferred taxes primarily due
to the expected utilization of deferred taxes on the companys current year tax
return; and
 
·                  A decrease of $443 million in intangible assets driven by amortization;
partially offset by
 
·                  An increase of $1,111 million in pension assets driven by contributions
and the estimated returns on plan assets; and
 
·                  An increase of $1,046 million in goodwill primarily driven by currency.
 
Long-term
debt decreased $2,106 million primarily due to a reclass to short-term debt as
certain instruments approach maturity.
 
Other
noncurrent liabilities, excluding debt, increased $824 million as a result of:
 
·                  An increase in other liabilities of $1,671 million
primarily driven by noncurrent tax reserves of $947 million and $300 million in
derivative liabilities, primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates;
that was partially offset by
 
·                  A decrease in retirement and nonpension benefit
obligations of $1,025 million primarily driven by contributions and the
estimated returns on plan assets including a currency impact of $571 million.
 
Debt
 
The companys funding
requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage
the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains
sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.

Global Financing provides
financing predominantly for the companys external clients as well as for
assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global
Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing
asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 64.

Table
of Contents
 
Given the significant
leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes
Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is more
representative of the companys core business operations. The companys
long-term core debt-to-capitalization ratio objective is 20 to 30 percent.
This ratio can vary from period to period as the company manages its global
cash and debt positions.
 
Core
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
14.2 percent at September 30, 2009 compared to 48.7 percent at December 31,
2008. The reduction was primarily driven by the decrease in non-Global
Financing debt of $7,038 million from December 31, 2008 balances.
 
Consolidated
debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2009 was 57.9 percent versus
71.4 percent at December 31, 2008.
 
Equity
 
Stockholders
equity increased $4,909 million primarily as a result of an increase in
retained earnings of $6,459 million, a decrease in accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $1,358 million and an increase of $1,353 million in
common stock, partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $4,240 million,
driven by the companys common stock repurchases in the first nine months of
2009.
 
Looking Forward
 
The company delivers value to its clients
through the following three strategic priorities, which are described more
fully in the 2008 IBM Annual Report on pages 20 and 21, under the section
entitled Strategy:
 
·        Focus on High-Value Solutions and Open Technologies
·        Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients
·        Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise
 
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in over 170 countries, with
approximately 65 percent of its 2008 revenue and 63 percent of its first nine
months of 2009 revenue generated outside the U.S. This global reach gives the
company access to markets, with well-established organizations and management
systems that understand the clients and their challenges and that can respond
to these opportunities with value-add solutions. The companys transformation
to a globally integrated enterprise provides the capabilities to service clients
globally and deliver the best skills and cost from anywhere in the world.
 
In growth markets, the
company will continue to invest for revenue growth by capturing new
infrastructure spending in these markets. While these economies have slowed,
these markets still offer good growth opportunities relative to the rest of the
world. The company has developed a strong value proposition for the established
markets based on cost reduction, capital conservation and risk management.
 
The companys Smarter
Planet strategy is providing an important new opportunity to deliver value to
clients. The company anticipates a significant opportunity in smart
infrastructure projects as governments around the world implement economic
stimulus programs focused on next generation smart grids, healthcare-related
information technology and broadband. 
The company is currently engaged on approximately 50 smart grid projects
across both growth and major markets. Projects of these types require
technology integration and industry insight which uniquely positions the
company to participate in these opportunities.
 
Two other key initiatives
that the company is investing in are business analytics and cloud computing.
Business analytics leverages the companys capabilities to optimize its clients
business performance by applying analytics to their business processes.
Advanced analytics software and services allow clients who generate enormous
amounts of data to predict trends, optimize their operations and create new
sources of revenue. Cloud computing is an emerging model for delivering and
consuming IT-enabled services.  In
mid-June, the company announced the IBM Smart Business cloud portfolio with
solutions to help clients deploy their own clouds targeting specific workloads.
Each of these three opportunities require enterprise software, deep industry
process knowledge and solution integration capabilities  all key strengths of
the company.

The company remains
committed to technology leadership and will continue to focus internal
investments, complemented with strategic acquisitions, on high-value,
high-growth opportunities. The company invested over $6 billion in RD&E in
2008 and approximately $30 billion over the past five years.
 
In addition, the companys
financial position is strong. Through its efficient cash generation business
model based on disciplined balance sheet management, in the first nine months
of 2009, the company generated $14.3 billion in operating cash flow and had
$11.5 billion in cash and marketable securities at September 30, 2009.
This provides the company with the financial flexibility for investments in
changing business environments. The company will also continue its
transformation to high-value segments with continued focus on cost and expense
management and improved efficiency.  The
ongoing focus on improving productivity in all areas of the business has
reduced the companys fixed cost base and improved its operational balance
point. The company continues to expect approximately $3.5 billion of cost and
expense savings in 2009 from structural actions it has taken. In the first nine
months of 2009, those efforts translated to margin expansion and the company
expects this to continue for the balance of the year.
 
In May 2007, the company met with
investors and analysts and discussed a road map to deliver earnings per share
in 2010 in the range of $10 to $11 per share, or 14 to 16 percent compound
growth rate from 2006. The companys 2010 roadmap is comprised of two key
components. First, the 2010 roadmap includes generating earnings per share in
the range of $9 to $10 per share, or 10 to 14 percent growth from 2006 through
a combination of operational elements including revenue growth, margin
improvement, growth initiatives, acquisitions and effective capital deployment
to fund growth and provide returns to shareholders through dividends and common
stock repurchases. In addition to these operational elements, the companys
roadmap to the $10 to $11 per share range includes the projected benefit of
retirement-related costs based on December 31, 2006 assumptions. Actual
retirement-related costs will depend on several factors including financial
market performance, the interest rate environment and actuarial assumptions. In
March 2008 and May 2009, the company met with investors and analysts
and discussed the progress the company is making on its 2010 roadmap.
 
In January 2009, the company
disclosed that it was projecting earnings per share of at least $9.20 per
diluted share for the full year 2009, primarily driven by margin improvement.
In April 2009, the company reiterated its projection of at least $9.20 per
diluted share for 2009. In July 2009, the company increased its projection
for 2009 to at least $9.70 of diluted earnings per share. In October 2009,
the company raised its projection for earnings per share to at least $9.85 for
2009, an increase of $0.15 since July, and double-digit earnings per share
growth for 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, as the company continues to
execute its strategy and maintains its focus on delivering profit and cash over
the longer term, it believes that it is well ahead of pace of attaining its
2010 roadmap. Also, in October 2009, the company stated that, at current
spot rates, the company expects to return to revenue growth at actual currency
rates in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
The companys performance in the first
nine months of 2009 highlighted the benefits of its global reach and the
strength of its business model. The financial results reflected solid progress
on major elements of the long-term goals, however, the company measures the
success of its business model over the long term, not any individual quarter or
year. The companys strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an
objective of optimizing long-term performance.
 
The company is a proven infrastructure
provider of IT technology. The companys broad product and services portfolio delivers
value to clients  through a combination of services, hardware and software.
The portfolio is focused on high-value solutions that can deliver measurable
benefit to clients with offerings that can address a wide scope of client
issues including: energy savings, security and resiliency, risk management and
cost reduction among many others.
 
The continued investments in Software have
led to this segments emergence as a strong source of revenue growth and the
largest contributor to the companys profit. The Software business is
differentiated in the industry by both the strength of its individual products
and the breadth of the software offerings. Clients continue to rely on the
extensive middleware portfolio to help them transform their business,
streamline costs and seek new business opportunities. The key to continued
Software growth stems from the ability to maintain and grow this
industry-leading software business, and by continuing to capitalize on industry
trends. Investments will be aligned to advance the companys growth strategy
through new client acquisition, with specific focus on key industries and local
businesses. The company will also continue to focus on expanding its software
capabilities through a combination of internal development and strategic
acquisitions. The acquisition of SPSS, which was completed in early October,
further expands the companys business analytics capabilities. The company
expects Software pre-tax income to be approximately $8 billion in 2009.

Within the Global Services business,
combined profit improved in the first nine months driven by gross margin and
pre-tax margin expansion. The company continues to see the results of the
targeted actions it has taken to transform the services business model; margin
improvements have resulted from the focus on a competitive cost structure and a
shift to higher value segments, while delivering value and quality to clients.
The Global Services business enters the fourth quarter with strong executional
momentum and a revenue backlog of $134 billion, an increase of $5 billion from
the prior year (up $1 billion adjusted for currency). The company continues to
evolve and adapt its offerings to meet the changing needs for its clients. A
key example is the new Business Analytics and Optimization service line within
GBS which will draw on the full scope of the companys capabilities to solve
clients business problems. The company has assembled a 4,000 person workforce
to address this opportunity. The company recently announced a new advanced
analytics center in New York City, staffed with 450 consultants and researchers.
The company expects to see continued benefit from its actions in margin
improvement for the remainder of the year, and also expects the Global Services
business to deliver approximately $8 billion of combined segment pre-tax profit
for the full year.
 
In the Systems and Technology business,
the company will focus its investments on differentiating technologies with high-growth
potential including POWER, high-performance computing, virtualization,
nanotechnology and energy efficiency. In this market, the value has shifted to
the high end to address clients needs to consolidate and virtualize their
environments. The company will focus on providing clients with a clear path to
a fully dynamic infrastructure that not only reduces cost, but is both
intelligent and secure. In the third quarter, the company announced new
offerings, System z Solution Editions, which will expand the platforms value
proposition to both new and existing clients. The company expects double-digit
year-to-year pre-tax profit growth in the fourth quarter in Systems and
Technology.
 
The company expects 2009 pre-tax
retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $1.3 billion, approximately
$100 million lower compared to 2008. This estimate reflects current pension
plan assumptions, including a one-time benefit of approximately $100 million
related to the curtailment of a non-U.S. defined benefit plan. For the period
ending September 30, 2009, the estimated return on assets for the IBM
Personal Pension Plan (U.S. Plan) was 9 percent and for all worldwide defined
benefit plans the return on assets was 10 percent. See the companys 2008
Annual Report Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, on pages 106 to 116
for additional information.
 
The company expects in the normal course
of business that its effective tax rate in 2009 will be 26.7 percent. The rate
will change period to period based on non-recurring events, such as the
settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax law, as well as recurring
factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, the timing and
amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects
of various global income tax strategies.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At September 30, 2009, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at
year-end 2008. The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to
limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on pages 12 to 19.
 
In the first nine months
of 2009, the companys revenue declined 10.6 percent as reported and 5.3
percent adjusted for currency. In the third quarter, revenue decreased 6.9
percent as reported and 5.0 percent adjusted for currency. This currency impact
was driven from the companys operations in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. The company maintains currency hedging programs for cash planning
purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency
impacts on the companys financial results. In addition to the translation of
earnings, the impact of currency changes also may affect the companys pricing
and sourcing actions. For example, the company may procure components and
supplies in multiple functional currencies and sell products and services in
other currencies. The company believes that some of these currency-based
changes in cost impacts the price charged to clients. However, the company
estimates that the effect of currency, before taking pricing or sourcing
actions into account, and net of hedging activity, had an immaterial impact on
earnings per share growth for the first nine months of 2009.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by
linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into
foreign currency hedge contracts. The company is continuing to monitor the current
economic conditions in Venezuela and anticipates that Venezuela could be
declared highly inflationary, consistent with accounting standards, in the
first quarter of 2010. The companys operations in
 
58





Table of Contents
 
Venezuela are not significant (less than 1 percent of
total 2008 and nine months ended September 30, 2009 revenue), therefore,
the company does not expect a material impact from a shift to highly
inflationary.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
In the companys 2008
Annual Report, on pages 45 to 47, there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table
presented on page 45 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and
marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities
for each of the past five years. For the nine months ended, or as of, as
applicable, September 30, 2009, those amounts are $14.3 billion for net
cash from operating activities, $11.5 billion of cash and marketable securities
and $10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The major rating agencies ratings on the
companys debt securities at September 30, 2009 appear in the table below
and remain unchanged from December 31, 2008.  The company does not have ratings trigger
provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the
holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments
thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual
agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses
which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit
rating were to fall below investment grade. At September 30, 2009, the
fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $2,165
million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to
fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys
outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other
contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would
result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

The table appearing on page 46
of the 2008 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash
flows for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of
the way cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. While the company prepares
its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable
accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 6 of this Form 10-Q
and discusses causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that
format on page 54, the following is the management view of cash flows for
the first nine months of 2009 and 2008 prepared in a manner consistent with the
table and description on page 46 of the 2008 Annual Report:

Free cash flow for the
first nine months of 2009 increased $1,464 million versus the first nine months
of 2008. The improvement year to year was primarily driven by lower capital
expenditures. Also, in the first nine months of 2009, $6,499 million was
returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Table of Contents
 
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the
2008 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 14, Contingencies,
on pages 27 to 29 of this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $1.3 billion in 2009.  The
company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it
is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension
plan funding regulations.
 
Global
Financing
 
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is
measured as if it were a standalone entity. Accordingly, the information
presented in this section is consistent with this separate company view.  The mission of Global Financing is to facilitate
clients acquisition of IBM hardware, software and services with the objective
of generating consistently strong returns on equity.

The
decrease in revenue in the third quarter of 2009, as compared to the same
period in 2008, was primarily due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 15.4 percent (13 percent adjusted for
currency), due to decreases in financing revenue (down 13.5 percent to $419
million) and used equipment sales (down 21.6 percent to $117 million); and
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 8.2 percent driven by a decrease in
internal financing (down 25.8 percent to $136 million), partially offset by an
increase in used equipment sales to the Systems and Technology segment (up 3.6
percent to $283 million).
 
The
decrease in revenue in the first nine months of 2009, as compared to the same
period in 2008, was primarily due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 11.5 percent (6 percent adjusted for
currency), due to decreases in financing revenue (down 12.1 percent to $1,295
million) and used equipment sales (down 9.4 percent to $386 million); and
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 8.2 percent driven by a decrease in
internal financing (down 23.7 percent to $434 million), partially offset by an
increase in used equipment sales to the Systems and Technology segment (up 2.8
percent to $821 million).
 
In the
third quarter and year-to-date periods, the decrease in external and internal
financing revenue was primarily due to lower average asset balances.

Global Financing
gross profit decreased 6.8 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the
same period in 2008, with gross margin increasing 3.6 points.  Gross profit decreased 2.5 percent in the
first nine months of 2009 compared to the prior year, with gross margin
increasing 4.8 points.  The gross profit
dollar decrease in both periods was due to lower revenue. The margin
improvement in both periods was due to an improvement in financing margins.
 
Global Financing
pre-tax income increased 16.8 percent in the third quarter of 2009 versus the
same period in 2008. The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in
financing receivables provisions of $80 million and other selling, general and
administrative expense of $18 million, partially offset by the decrease in
gross profit of $42 million. Pre-tax income increased 5.8 percent in the first
nine months of 2009 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by decreases
in other selling, general and administrative expense of $84 million and
financing receivables provisions of $29 million, partially offset by the
decrease in gross profit of $47 million.
 
The increase in
return on equity for the third quarter 2009 compared to the same period in 2008
was primarily driven by higher after-tax income. The increase in return on
equity for the first nine months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of
2008 was driven by both higher after-tax income and a lower average equity
balance.

Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consists primarily of IBM hardware, software and services, but also
includes non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients total
solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type,
direct financing and operating leases for systems products as well as loans for
hardware, software and services with terms generally from two to seven years.
Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services and are
unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis in order to
mitigate the associated risk and, when deemed necessary, covenants are put into
agreements to protect against deterioration during the life of the obligation.
Client financing also includes internal activity as described on page 53
of the 2008 IBM Annual Report.
 
Commercial financing receivables arise primarily from
inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM
and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.  These short-term receivables are primarily
unsecured and are also subject to additional credit actions in order to
mitigate the associated risk.
 
Approximately
98 percent of Global Financings external financing assets are in the segments
core competency of technology equipment and solutions financing.  At September 30, 2009, approximately 57
percent of the external portfolio is with investment grade clients with no
direct exposure to consumers or mortgage lending institutions.

Cash collections of both client and
commercial financing assets exceeded new financing originations in the third
quarter, as well as the first nine months of 2009, which resulted in a net
decline in financing assets from June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively.  The decrease in
originations in both periods in the table above was primarily due to lower
demand for IT equipment associated with the current economic environment.
 
Cash generated by Global
Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and dividends
to IBM.

*   Represents reserved receivables, net of
recoveries, which were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents translation adjustments.
 
The percentage of global
financing receivables reserved increased from 2.0 percent at December 31,
2008 to 2.3 percent at September 30, 2009 due to the decline in the gross
financing receivables balance from December 31, 2008, and the increase in
the specific allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Specific reserves increased 3.1 percent from $386 million at December 31,
2008 to $398 million at September 30, 2009.  Unallocated reserves decreased $17 million
from $144 million at December 31, 2008 to $127 million at September 30,
2009 due to the decline in gross financing receivables.
 
Global Financings bad
debt expense was an increase of $89 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2009, compared to an increase of $119 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2008. The decrease in bad debt expense was attributed to a decline in specific
reserve requirements versus the prior year.
 
In the third quarter of
2009, compared to the third quarter of 2008, bad debt expense decreased $80
million due to the decline in specific reserve requirements.
 
Residual Value
 
Residual value is a risk
unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon
the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease
inception.  Global Financing has insight
into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global Financing optimizes the recovery of residual
values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to
new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of
equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment returned at the end of a
lease, represented 41.9 percent and 41.1 percent of Global Financings revenue
in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2009 and 38.8
percent and 37.5 percent in the third quarter and first nine months,
respectively, of 2008.  The increase in
both periods was driven primarily by the decrease in financing revenue.  The gross margins on these sales were 45.3
percent and 48.1 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The decrease is driven by
lower external sales margins. The gross margins were 49.8 percent and 47.9
percent for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The increase is driven by higher internal sales
margins.
 
The following table
presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and
direct financing leases and operating leases at December 31, 2008 and September 30,
2009. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30, 2009 is
expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that
are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease
or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees
were $116 million and $279 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and September 30,
2008, respectively, and $382 million and $757 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, respectively.
The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease
were $7 million and $9 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and September 30,
2008, respectively, and $23 million and $39 million for the financing
transactions originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2009
and September 30, 2008, respectively. The cost of guarantees was
$0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and

The
company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately
7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of
intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are
set by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying the
financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and
debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 61.
 
The Global Financing
business provides funding predominantly for the companys external clients but
also provides intercompany financing for the company. As previously stated, the
company measures Global Financing as if it were a standalone entity and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings
external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing
Results of Operations on page 60 and in Segment Information on pages 19
to 21.
 
In the companys
Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, however, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on total company debt.
In this table, intercompany activity is comprised of internal loans and leases
at arms-length pricing in support of Global Services long-term contracts and
other internal activity. The company believes these assets should be
appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business
model.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
Global Financing is a
segment of the company and as such, is supported by the companys overall
liquidity position and access to capital markets. Cash generated by Global
Financing was primarily deployed to pay intercompany payables and dividends to
the company in order to maintain an appropriate debt-to-equity ratio.

Looking Forward
 
Global Financings financial position provides
flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to be well
positioned in the current environment. Global Financings assets and new
financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services financed to the
companys clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets
are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financings offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financings originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
IBM continues to access both the short-term commercial
paper market and the medium and long-term debt markets.  A protracted period where IBM could not
access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in originations.
 
Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The companys interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies in
both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 63, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the companys product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each
of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with product
and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business
going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the economy.
