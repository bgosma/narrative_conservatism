Basis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein have been included. Jabil Inc. (the “Company”) has made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior periods’ Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to the current presentation. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019. Results for the three months ended November 30, 2019 are not necessarily an indication of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending August 31, 2020.2. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale ProgramsThe Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under a foreign asset-backed securitization program, a North American asset-backed securitization program and uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the “programs”). The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs. Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were not material. The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.Transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Asset-Backed Securitization ProgramsThe Company continuously sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under its foreign asset-backed securitization program and its North American asset-backed securitization program to special purpose entities, which in turn sell certain of the foreign asset-backed receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution and certain of the North American asset-backed receivables to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. The special purpose entity in the foreign asset-backed securitization program is a separate bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution. The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity. Accordingly, the special purpose entity associated with the foreign asset-backed securitization program is included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of November 30, 2019, the special purpose entity has liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company (primary beneficiary). The liabilities cannot exceed the maximum amount of net cash proceeds under the foreign asset-backed securitization program.The foreign asset-backed securitization program contains a guarantee of payment by the special purpose entity, in an amount approximately equal to the net cash proceeds under the program. No liability has been recorded for obligations under the guarantee as of November 30, 2019.The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain unsold receivables covering the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the North American asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of November 30, 2019.Following is a summary of the asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:    7Table of Contents

The North American asset-backed securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the five-year unsecured credit facility amended as of November 8, 2017 (the “2017 Credit Facility”). The foreign asset-backed securitization program covenants include limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.Trade Accounts Receivable Sale ProgramsThe following is a summary of the trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions where the Company may elect to sell receivables and the unaffiliated financial institution may elect to purchase, at a discount, on an ongoing basis:

4. LeasesEffective September 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (“ASU 2016-02”), Leases (Topic 842) using the modified retrospective approach and also elected to apply the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allows entities to maintain the historical lease classification for existing leases. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for building and real estate leases. The Company primarily has leases for buildings and real estate with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 36 years. Leases for other classes of assets are not significant. For any leases with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by evaluating if the contract conveys the right to use and control the specific property or equipment. Certain lease agreements contain purchase or renewal options. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Generally, the Company's lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. When determining the present value of future payment, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Any payment deemed probable under residual value guarantees is included in lease payments. Any variable payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate, are excluded from right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 9Table of ContentsUpon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recorded $414.6 million and $437.5 million of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, respectively, related to its existing operating lease portfolio. The accounting for the Company's finance leases remained substantially unchanged and balances were not significant on the adoption date. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table sets forth the amount of lease assets and lease liabilities included on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of the period indicated (in thousands):

Debt CovenantsBorrowings under the Company’s debt agreements are subject to various covenants that limit the Company’s ability to: incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, effect mergers and certain transactions, and effect certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates. In addition, the revolving credit facilities and the 4.900% Senior Notes contain debt leverage and interest coverage covenants. The Company is also subject to certain covenants requiring the Company to offer to repurchase the 5.625%, 4.700%, 4.900% or 3.950% Senior Notes upon a change of control.

The Switzerland plan, which is a qualified defined benefit pension plan, provides benefits based on average employee earnings over an approximately 8 years service period preceding retirement and length of employee service. The Company’s policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in Switzerland employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as are deemed appropriate by the Company.The following tables provide information only related to the Switzerland plan as of the acquisition date, September 30, 2019, and are preliminary estimates.Benefit Obligation and Plan AssetsThe benefit obligations and plan assets, changes to the benefit obligation and plan assets and the funded status of the Switzerland plan as of September 30, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):

8. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company’s financial performance and are referred to as market risks. The Company, where deemed appropriate, uses derivatives as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.Foreign Currency Risk ManagementForward contracts are put in place to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses. A hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $284.2 million and $334.1 million as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively. The related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The forward foreign exchange contract transactions will effectively lock in the value of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses against foreign currency fluctuations. The anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses being hedged are expected to occur between December 1, 2019 and November 30, 2020.In addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. The aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, was $3.1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.

The time-based restricted stock units generally vest on a graded vesting schedule over three years. The performance-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 150%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained. The performance-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is based upon the Company’s cumulative adjusted core earnings per share during the performance period. The market-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 200%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained. The market-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is tied to the Company’s total shareholder return based on the Company’s stock performance in relation to the companies in the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) Super Composite Technology Hardware and Equipment Index excluding the Company. During the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company awarded approximately 1.1 million and 1.5 million time-based restricted stock units, respectively, 0.3 million and 0.4 million performance-based restricted stock units, respectively and 0.3 million and 0.4 million market-based restricted stock units, respectively.The following represents the stock-based compensation information for the period indicated (in thousands):

During the three months ended November 30, 2019, the Company’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 49% of its net revenue and 65 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue. Sales to these customers were reported in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (“DMS”) operating segments.The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Some of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source.Segment DataNet revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed. An operating segment’s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net revenue less cost of revenue, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, segment research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate manufacturing expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment income does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, restructuring of securities loss, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, other expense (excluding certain components of net periodic benefit cost), interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or adjustment for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.The following table presents the Company’s revenues disaggregated by segment (in thousands):

(3) 
Primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.2020 Restructuring PlanOn September 20, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formally approved a restructuring plan to realign the Company’s global capacity support infrastructure, particularly in the Company’s mobility footprint in China, in order to optimize organizational effectiveness. This action includes headcount reductions and capacity realignment (the “2020 Restructuring Plan”). The 2020 Restructuring Plan reflects the Company’s intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain locations are still subject to consultation with the Company’s employees and their representatives. The Company currently expects to recognize approximately $85.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs primarily over the course of the Company’s fiscal year 2020. This information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. The Company’s estimates for the charges discussed above exclude any potential income tax effects.The table below summarizes the Company’s liability activity, primarily associated with the 2020 Restructuring Plan(in thousands):17Table of Contents

Balance as of August 31, 2019 primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.13. Income TaxesEffective Income Tax RateThe U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company's effective income tax rate are as follows:
The effective income tax rate increased for the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018, primarily due to: (i) $13.3 million of tax benefit for the three months ended November 30, 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) adjustments and (ii) increased restructuring charges with minimal related tax benefit for the three months ended November 30, 2019.The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 primarily due to: (i) losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances; (ii) tax incentives granted to sites in Brazil, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam; and (iii) adjustments to amounts previously recorded for the Tax Act for the three months ended November 30, 2018.14. Earnings Per Share and DividendsEarnings Per ShareThe Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities. The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock unit awards (“restricted stock units”) and dilutive stock appreciation rights.Potential shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when their effect would be antidilutive. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered dilutive when the related performance criteria have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of the performance period. All potential shares of common stock are antidilutive in periods of net loss. Potential shares of common stock not included in the computation of earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive or because the performance criterion was not met were as follows (in thousands):
DividendsThe following table sets forth cash dividends declared by the Company to common stockholders during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except for per share data):18Table of Contents
15. Business AcquisitionsDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies (“JJMD”) entered into a Framework Agreement to form a strategic collaboration and expand its existing relationship. The strategic collaboration expands the Company’s medical device manufacturing portfolio, diversification and capabilities. On February 25, 2019 and April 29, 2019, under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the Company completed the initial and second closings, respectively, of its acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. The preliminary aggregate purchase price paid for the initial and second closings was approximately $163.1 million in cash, which remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments. For the initial and second closings, total assets acquired of $169.4 million and total liabilities assumed of $6.3 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates.On September 30, 2019, under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the Company completed the third closing of its acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. The preliminary aggregate purchase price paid for the third closing was approximately $106.9 million in cash, which remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments based on conditions within the Framework Agreement. For the third closing, total assets acquired of $185.0 million, including $83.2 million in contract assets, $35.1 million in inventory and $55.7 million in goodwill, and total liabilities assumed of $78.1 million, including $58.8 million of pension obligations, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. There were no intangible assets identified in this acquisition and the goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce. The majority of the goodwill is currently not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition of the JJMD assets have been accounted for as separate business combinations for each closing using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company is currently evaluating the fair values of the assets and liabilities related to these business combinations. The preliminary estimates and measurements are, therefore, subject to change during the measurement period for assets acquired, liabilities assumed and tax adjustments. The results of operations were included in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial results beginning on February 25, 2019 for the initial closing, April 29, 2019 for the second closing and September 30, 2019 for the third closing. The Company believes it is impracticable to provide pro forma information for the acquisition of the JJMD assets.16.

The Senior Non-Convertible Preferred Stock is valued each reporting period using unobservable inputs based on a discounted cash flow model and is classified as an available for sale debt security with any unrealized loss recorded to AOCI. As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, the unobservable inputs have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculation. 





(4) 
Fair value measurements are based on the contractual terms of the derivatives and use observable market-based inputs. The interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative using observable inputs including interest rate curves and credit spreads. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximates fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximates current market rates. Notes payable and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost; however, the Company estimates the fair values of notes payable and long-term debt for disclosure purposes. The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's notes payable and long-term debt, by hierarchy level as of the periods indicated:

New Accounting GuidanceRecently Adopted Accounting GuidanceDuring fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard revising lease accounting, which requires the Company to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements. The accounting standard became effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Refer to Note 4 - “Leases” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities by simplifying the application of hedge accounting and improving the related disclosures in its financial statements. This guidance became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the impact on future periods will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions.Recently Issued Accounting GuidanceDuring fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective or prospective transition method, depending on the area covered by this accounting standard. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.During fiscal year 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.Recently issued accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable or did not have, or is not expected to have, a material impact to the Company.22Table of ContentsJABIL INC.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewWe are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in various industries and end markets. Our services enable our customers to reduce manufacturing costs, improve supply-chain management, reduce inventory obsolescence, lower transportation costs and reduce product fulfillment time. Our manufacturing and supply chain management services and solutions include innovation, design, planning, fabrication and assembly, delivery and managing the flow of resources and products. We derive substantially all of our revenue from production and product management services (collectively referred to as “manufacturing services”), which encompass the act of producing tangible components that are built to customer specifications and are then provided to the customer.We serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue, which in turn depends upon their growth, viability and financial stability. Based on net revenue, for the three months ended November 30, 2019, our largest customers include Amazon.com, Inc., Apple, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., GoPro, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Ingenico Group, Johnson and Johnson, LM Ericsson Telephone Company, NetApp, Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc..We conduct our operations in facilities that are located worldwide, including but not limited to, China, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and the United States. We derived a substantial majority, 81.8% of net revenue from our international operations for the three months ended November 30, 2019. Our global manufacturing production sites allow customers to manufacture products simultaneously in the optimal locations for their products. Our global presence is key to assessing and executing on our business opportunities.We have two reporting segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (“DMS”), which are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. Our EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing our large scale manufacturing infrastructure and our ability to serve a broad range of end markets. Our EMS segment is a high volume business that produces product at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, cloud, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, print and retail, and smart home and appliances industries. Our DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. Our DMS includes customers primarily in the edge devices and accessories, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.We monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances change.Summary of ResultsThe following table sets forth, for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data):
Key Performance Indicators24Table of ContentsManagement regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess the Company’s operating results. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of management’s key financial performance indicators:







 





(1) 
The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.





(2) 
Inventory turns and days in inventory are calculated based on inventory and contract asset balances. 





(3) 
During the three months ended November 30, 2019, the increase in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by higher sales and timing of collections.





(4) 
During the three months ended August 31, 2019, the decrease in days in inventory from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to increased sales activity during the quarter.





(5) 
During the three months ended May 31, 2019, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 — “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 18 – “New Accounting Guidance” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.Results of OperationsNet RevenueGenerally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or separately report revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure.The distribution of revenue across our segments has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including the following: fluctuations in customer demand; efforts to diversify certain portions of our business; business growth from new and existing customers; specific product performance; and any potential termination, or substantial winding down, of significant customer relationships. 
25Table of Contents






 Net revenue increased during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018. Specifically, the EMS segment revenues increased 26% primarily due to (i) a 27% increase in revenues from existing customers within our cloud business, (ii) a 3% increase in revenues from existing customers within our print and retail business, (iii) a 2% increase in revenues from existing customers within our automotive and transportation business and (iv) a 2% increase in revenues spread across various industries within the EMS segment. The increase is partially offset by (i) a 6% decrease from existing customers within our networking and telecommunications business and (ii) a 2% decrease from existing customers within our computing and storage business and our capital equipment business, which we expect to remain weak into the second half of calendar year 2020. DMS segment revenues increased 3% due to a 12% increase in revenues from new and existing customers in our healthcare and packaging businesses. The increase is partially offset by a 9% decrease in revenue from customers within our mobility and edge devices and accessories businesses as a result of decreased end user product demand and end market dynamics. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, foreign source revenue expressed as a percentage of net revenue:
Gross Profit
For the three months ended November 30, 2019, gross profit for our EMS segment decreased as a percent of net revenue due to product mix and continued weakness in the capital equipment business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross profit as a percent of net revenue in our DMS segment due to improved profitability across the various businesses. Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018. The increase is predominantly due to (i) a $30.6 million increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs primarily to support new business growth and development and our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company, (ii) a $7.2 million increase in acquisition and integration charges related to our strategic collaboration with a healthcare company and (iii) a $13.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by an appreciation in our stock price during the three months ended November 30, 2019.Research and Development26Table of Contents
Research and development expenses remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018. Amortization of Intangibles 
Amortization of intangibles increased during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018, primarily driven by amortization related to the Nypro trade name, which was reclassified to a definite-lived intangible asset during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 as a result of our decision to rebrand. As such, this trade name was assigned a four-year estimated useful life and is being amortized on an accelerated basis. Restructuring and Related ChargesFollowing is a summary of the Company’s restructuring and related charges (in millions):







 






(2) 
Primarily relates to the 2020 Restructuring Plan.





(3) 
Primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.2020 Restructuring PlanOn September 20, 2019, our Board of Directors formally approved a restructuring plan to realign our global capacity support infrastructure, particularly in our mobility footprint in China, in order to optimize organizational effectiveness. This action includes headcount reductions and capacity realignment (the “2020 Restructuring Plan”). The 2020 Restructuring Plan reflects our intention only and restructuring decisions, and the timing of such decisions, at certain locations are still subject to consultation with our employees and their representatives. We currently expect to recognize approximately $85.0 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs primarily over the course of our fiscal year 2020. The charges relating to the 2020 Restructuring Plan are currently expected to result in cash expenditures in the range of approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million that will be payable over the course of our fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The exact timing of these charges and cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type, have not been finalized. This information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions, consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. Our estimates for the charges discussed above exclude any potential income tax effects.The 2020 Restructuring Plan, once complete, is expected to yield annualized cost savings beginning in fiscal year 2021 of approximately $40.0 million. We expect cost savings of $25.0 million during fiscal year 2020.27Table of ContentsSee Note 12 – “Restructuring and Related Charges” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of restructuring and related charges for the 2020 Restructuring Plan.Other Expense
Other expense decreased for the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018, primarily due to: (i) $2.3 million related to a decrease in fees associated with the utilization of the trade accounts receivable sales programs and fees incurred for the amendment of the foreign asset-backed securitization program and the new North American asset-backed securitization program in fiscal year 2019 and (ii) $1.7 million related to lower net periodic benefit costs. The decrease was partially offset by $1.6 million of other expense.Interest Income
Interest income remained relatively consistent during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018.Interest Expense
Interest expense increased during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018, due to additional borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program, partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Tax Expense
The effective income tax rate increased for the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2018, primarily due to: (i) $13.3 million of tax benefit for the three months ended November 30, 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) adjustments and (ii) increased restructuring charges with minimal related tax benefit for the three months ended November 30, 2019.Non-GAAP (Core) Financial MeasuresThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the reconciliations below. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our “core” financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our “core” financial measures.28Table of ContentsManagement believes that the non-GAAP “core” financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, other than temporary impairment on securities, restructuring of securities loss, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP “core” financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.We determine the tax effect of the items excluded from “core” earnings and “core” diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied.We are reporting “core” operating income, “core” earnings and adjusted free cash flow to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our “core” manufacturing operations. A significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating “core” operating income and “core” earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating “core” operating income and “core” earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders’ ownership interest. We encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-GAAP financial measures.Adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash receipts on sold receivables less net capital expenditures (acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment). We report adjusted free cash flow as we believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in measuring our ability to generate cash internally and fund future growth and to provide a return to shareholders.Included in the tables below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Results to Non-GAAP Measures29Table of Contents







 





(1) 
Charges relate to accounts receivable and inventory charges for certain distressed customers primarily in the renewable energy sector.





(2) 
Following the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) (“ASU 2017-07”), pension service cost is recognized in cost of revenue and all other components of net periodic benefit cost, including return on plan assets, are presented in other expense.  We are reclassifying the pension components in other expense to core operating income as we assess operating performance, inclusive of all components of net periodic benefit cost, with the related revenue. There is no impact to core earnings or diluted core earnings per share for this adjustment.





(3) 
Charges, net of insurance proceeds of $2.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2018, relate to business interruptions and asset impairment costs associated with damage from Hurricane Maria, which impacted our operations in Cayey, Puerto Rico.





(4) 
Charges related to our strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies (“JJMD”).





(5) 
The three months ended November 30, 2018 includes a $13.3 million income tax benefit for the effects of the Tax Act.Adjusted Free Cash Flow







 





(1) 
In fiscal year 2019, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" resulted in a reclassification of cash flows from operating activities to investing activities for cash receipts for the deferred purchase price receivable on asset-backed securitization transactions. The adoption of this standard does not reflect a change in the underlying business or activities. The effects of this change are applied retrospectively to all prior periods.30Table of ContentsAcquisitions and ExpansionDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies (“JJMD”) entered into a Framework Agreement to form a strategic collaboration and expand our existing relationship. The strategic collaboration expands our medical device manufacturing portfolio, diversification and capabilities.On February 25, 2019 and April 29, 2019, under the terms of the Framework Agreement, we completed the initial and second closings, respectively, of our acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. The preliminary aggregate purchase price paid for the initial and second closings was approximately $163.1 million in cash, which remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments. For the initial and second closings, total assets acquired of $169.4 million and total liabilities assumed of $6.3 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates.On September 30, 2019, under the terms of the Framework Agreement, we completed the third closing of our acquisition of certain assets of JJMD. The preliminary aggregate purchase price paid for the third closing was approximately $106.9 million in cash, which remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments based on conditions within the Framework Agreement. For the third closing, total assets acquired of $185.0 million, including $83.2 million in contract assets, $35.1 million in inventory and $55.7 million in goodwill, and total liabilities assumed of $78.1 million, including $58.8 million of pension obligations, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. There were no intangible assets identified in this acquisition and the goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce. The majority of the goodwill is currently not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.The acquisition of the JJMD assets have been accounted for as separate business combinations for each closing using the acquisition method of accounting. We are currently evaluating the fair values of the assets and liabilities related to these business combinations. The preliminary estimates and measurements are, therefore, subject to change during the measurement period for assets acquired, liabilities assumed and tax adjustments. The results of operations were included in our consolidated financial results beginning on February 25, 2019 for the initial closing, April 29, 2019 for the second closing and September 30, 2019 for the third closing. We believe it is impracticable to provide pro forma information for the acquisition of the JJMD assets.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, approved share repurchase programs, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common stock.Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs of November 30, 2019, we had approximately $719.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. As our growth remains predominantly outside of the United States, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. Most of our cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2019 could be repatriated to the United States without potential tax consequences.Notes Payable and Credit FacilitiesFollowing is a summary of principal debt payments and debt issuance for our notes payable and credit facilities:31Table of Contents







 





(1) 
As of November 30, 2019, we had $2.6 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facility supports commercial paper outstanding, if any. We have a borrowing capacity of up to $1.8 billion under our commercial paper program. We have a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources.Our Senior Notes and our credit facilities contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. As of November 30, 2019, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Refer to Note 5 – “Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.Asset-Backed Securitization and Trade Accounts Receivable Sale ProgramsAsset-Backed Securitization ProgramsWe continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under our foreign asset-backed securitization program and our North American asset-backed securitization program to special purpose entities, which in turn sell certain of the foreign asset-backed receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution and certain of the North American asset-backed receivables to conduits administered by an unaffiliated financial institution on a monthly basis. The foreign asset-backed securitization program contains a guarantee of payment by the special purpose entity, in an amount approximately equal to the net cash proceeds under the program. No liability has been recorded for obligations under the guarantee as of November 30, 2019.Certain unsold receivables covering the maximum amount of net cash proceeds available under the North American asset-backed securitization program are pledged as collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution as of November 30, 2019.Following is a summary of our asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:

Maximum amount available at any one time.In connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, during the three months ended November 30, 2019, we sold $1.2 billion of trade accounts receivable and we received cash proceeds of $1.2 billion. As of November 30, 2019, we had up to $4.0 million in available liquidity under our asset-backed securitization programs. 32Table of ContentsOur asset-backed securitization programs contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under our asset-backed securitization programs. Refer to Note 2 – “Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the programs.Trade Accounts Receivable Sale ProgramsFollowing is a summary of the trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions.

We entered into two new trade accounts receivable sale programs on December 5, 2019 with maximum amounts of $500.0 million and CHF 100.0 million, respectively. During the three months ended November 30, 2019, we sold $2.0 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $2.0 billion. As of November 30, 2019, we had up to $1.4 billion in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.Capital ExpendituresFor fiscal year 2020, we anticipate our net capital expenditures will be approximately $800.0 million. Our capital expenditures will support ongoing maintenance in our DMS and EMS segments and investments in new markets. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things.Cash Flows    The following table sets forth selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands):33Table of Contents
Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2019 was primarily due to non-cash expenses and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by increased accounts receivable, inventories and contract assets. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in materials purchases due to increased demand in the cloud business, the timing of purchases and cash payments as well as an increase due to the timing of collections on accounts receivable sale programs. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by higher sales and the timing of collections. The increase in inventories supports expected sales levels in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 and also is due to increased demand. The increase in contract assets primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition for over time customers.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the DMS and EMS segments and expenditures for assets acquired in connection with the third closing of the acquisition of certain assets of JJMD, partially offset by proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2019 was primarily due to: (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock and (iii) dividend payments. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by borrowings under debt agreements.Contractual ObligationsAs of the date of this report, there were no material changes, other than those disclosed below, outside the ordinary course of business, since August 31, 2019 to our contractual obligations and commitments.In connection with the third closing of the acquisition of certain assets of JJMD, we assumed additional contractual obligations related to postretirement benefit plans and executed certain financing leases.
