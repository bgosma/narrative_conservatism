Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the companys management, these statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results may be different. See the companys 2011 Annual Report on pages 58 to 61 for a discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys 2011 Annual Report.
 
Noncontrolling interest amounts in income of $2.0 million and $2.1 million, net of tax, for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $5.7 million and $4.8 million, net of tax, for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense line item. Additionally, changes to noncontrolling interests which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 8 were $(6) million and $(43) million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated where applicable.
 
2. Accounting Changes: In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. These amendments did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial results. These changes became effective January 1, 2012 on a prospective basis. See Note 3, Financial Instruments on pages 9 to 14 for fair value disclosures.
 
In July 2012, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment.  After an assessment of certain qualitative factors, if it is determined to be more likely than not that an indefinite-lived asset is impaired, entities must perform the quantitative impairment test.  Otherwise, the quantitative test is optional.  The amended guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial results.
 
3. Financial Instruments:
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:
 
·                  Level 1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date;
·                  Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
·                  Level 3Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 
The guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort.
 
When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation adjustments to the base valuations calculated using the methodologies described below for several parameters that market participants would consider in determining fair value:
 
·                  Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·                  Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
As an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are available for the full term of the derivative.
 
Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair value at the measurement date to the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale equity investments that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a financial investment, fair value is measured using a model described above.
 
Non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type of asset. See Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 76 to 86 in the companys 2011 Annual Report for further information. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
Accounting guidance permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company does not apply the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.

(1)     Included within cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
(2)     Included within investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
(3)     The gross balances of derivative assets contained within prepaid expenses and other current assets, and investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2011 are $546 million and $754 million, respectively.
(4)     The gross balances of derivative liabilities contained within other accrued expenses and liabilities, and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2011 are $365 million and $166 million, respectively.
(5)     Available-for-sale securities with carrying values that approximate fair value.
(6)     If derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement had been netted in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the total derivative asset and liability positions would have been reduced by $324 million each.
 
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
 
Notes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial.  If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
Long-term Debt
 
Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt is $24,766 million and $22,857 million and the estimated fair value is $27,688 million and $27,383 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.  If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity Securities

Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the companys lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. The companys established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.
 
The company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its major counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $77 million and $131 million, respectively, for which no collateral was posted at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  Full collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event that the companys credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in net asset positions as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $1,356 million and $1,300 million, respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date as a result of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. This exposure was reduced by $376 million and $324 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, this exposure was reduced by $465 million and $466 million of cash collateral, respectively, received by the company. In addition to cash collateral, the company held
 
14





Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
$93 million in non-cash collateral, in U.S. Treasury securities, at June 30, 2012.  Per accounting guidance, non-cash collateral is not recorded on the Statement of Financial Position.
 
The company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. No amount was recognized in other receivables at June 30, 2012 or December 31, 2011 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral totaled $465 million and $466 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was rehypothecated at June 30, 2012 or at December 31, 2011.
 
The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
 
In its hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
 
A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings
 
The company issues debt in the global capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan portfolio. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the total notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps was $5.9 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was approximately 5.0 years and 5.5 years, respectively.
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
 
At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, net losses of approximately $1 million and $5 million (before taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in connection with cash flow hedges of the companys borrowings. Within these amounts, $2 million and $6 million of losses are expected to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying transactions.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
A large portion of the companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $6.7 billion and $5.0 billion,
 
15





Table of Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was approximately 0.2 years and 0.4 years, respectively.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
The companys operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $11.4 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of 0.7 years and 0.7 years, respectively.
 
At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of $69 million and $88 million (before taxes), respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts $199 million and $191 million of gains, respectively, are expected to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.
 
Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, no instruments relating to this program were outstanding.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $14.1 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.
 
Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the companys own stock primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
The company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
 
The company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company utilizes credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures. These derivatives have terms of one year or less. The

swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
 
The following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and non-derivative instrument related risk management activity as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 as well as for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively:

Note: AOCI represents Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
 
(1)              The amount includes changes in clean fair values of the derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships and the periodic accrual for coupon payments required under these derivative contracts.
(2)              The amount includes basis adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item recorded during the period and amortization of basis adjustments recorded on de-designated hedging relationships during the period.
(3)              The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income represents ineffectiveness on hedge relationships.
(4)     Instruments in net investment hedges include derivative and non-derivative instruments.
 
For the three and six months ending June 30, 2012, and 2011, there were no significant gains or losses recognized in earnings representing hedge ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (for fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying exposure that did not or was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor are there any anticipated in the normal course of business.
 
Refer to the companys 2011  Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies, on pages 83 and 84 for additional information on the companys use of derivative financial instruments.

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relate principally to the companys systems products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of $713 million and $745 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of $682 million and $733 million, and net of the allowance for credit losses of $116 million and $118 million at those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $39 million and $53 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $140 million and $126 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, are loans that are provided by Global Financing primarily to clients to finance the purchase of software and services. Separate contractual relationships on these financing arrangements are for terms ranging generally from one to seven years.
 
Installment payment receivables, net of allowance for credit losses of $31 million and $51 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to clients to finance hardware, software and services ranging generally from one to three years.
 
Client loan receivables and installment payment receivables financing contracts are priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of enforcing the terms of these separate financing agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for borrowings were $368 million and $324 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
 
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
The following tables present financing receivables on a gross basis excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The company determines its allowance for credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan receivables, and further segments the portfolio via two classes: major markets and growth markets. For additional information on the companys accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, see the companys 2011 Annual Report beginning on page 85.

When determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. In addition, the company records an unallocated reserve that is determined by applying a reserve rate to its different portfolios, excluding accounts that have been specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit rating, probability of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.

Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status
 
Certain receivables for which the company has recorded a specific reserve may also be placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual assets are those receivables with specific reserves and other accounts for which it is likely that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original terms of the lease or loan agreement. Income recognition is discontinued on these receivables.
 
The following table presents the recorded investment in financing receivables which are on non-accrual status at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Impaired Loans
 
The company considers any loan with an individually evaluated reserve as an impaired loan. Depending on the level of impairment, loans will also be placed on non-accrual status (see section Financing Receivables on Non-Accrual Status).
 
The following tables present impaired client loan receivables.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
The companys credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moodys Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. Moodys does not provide credit ratings to the company on its customers.
 
The tables below present the gross recorded investment for each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
Troubled Debt Restructurings
 
The company assessed all restructurings that occurred on or after January 1, 2011 and determined that there were no troubled debt restructurings for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012.
 
5. Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service period.  The following table presents total stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings:

The decrease in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, was primarily due to a decrease related to the companys assumption of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities of $1 million and $3 million, respectively.
 
As of June 30, 2012, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,411 million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years.
 
There was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at June 30, 2012 and 2011.
 
6. Segments:  The tables on pages 26 and 27 reflect the results of operations of the companys segments consistent with the management and measurement system utilized within the company. Performance measurement is based on pre-tax income. These results are used, in part, by senior management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

The company received a $4.3 million subsidy in the second quarter of 2012 and a $20.8 million subsidy for the first half of 2012 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by the company to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the participants. For further information related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 134 in the companys 2011 Annual Report.
 
In the second quarter, the U.S. Congress passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act, also referred to as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, which included pension funding stabilization provisions. The company has evaluated the provisions of the new law and expects no material impacts.

Each acquisition further complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of product and services offerings. Green Hat helps customers improve the quality of software applications by enabling developers to use cloud computing technologies to conduct testing of a software application prior to its delivery. Emptoris expands the companys cloud-based analytics offerings that provide supply chain intelligence leading to better inventory management and cost efficiencies. Worklight delivers mobile application management capabilities to clients across a wide range of industries. The acquisition enhances the companys comprehensive mobile portfolio, which is designed to help global corporations leverage the proliferation of all mobile devices  from laptops and smartphones to tablets. DemandTec delivers cloud-based analytics software to help organizations improve their price, promotion and product mix within the broad context of enterprise commerce. Varicents software automates and analyzes data across sales, finance, human resources and IT departments to uncover trends and optimize sales performance and operations. Vivisimo software automates the discovery of big data, regardless of its format or where it resides, providing decision makers with a view of key business information necessary to drive new initiatives. Tealeaf provides a full suite of customer experience management software, which analyzes interactions on websites and mobile devices. Platform Computings focused technical and distributed computing management software helps clients create, integrate and manage shared computing environments that are used in compute-and-data intensive applications such as simulations, computer modeling and analytics. Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions as reflected in the table above, is paid primarily in cash.  All acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
 
The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired companies and IBM and the acquired assembled work-force, neither of which qualify as an amortizable intangible asset.  The overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 6.9 years. These identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill of $1,596 million has been assigned to the Software ($1,370 million), Global Business Services ($5 million) and Systems and Technology ($222 million) segments. It is expected that approximately 10 percent of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.
 
Divestitures: On April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its Retail Store Solutions business to Toshiba Tec. As part of the transaction, Toshiba Tec and the company will sign a multi-year business partner agreement to integrate retail store solutions for Smarter Commerce. The transaction price is $850 million, and the company will receive approximately $800 million in cash, net of closing date working capital adjustments. The company will acquire a 19.9 percent ownership for three years in the new holding company that Toshiba Tec will establish for the business. This transaction is subject to regulatory requirements and customary closing conditions and will close in phases, with the initial closing expected in the third quarter of 2012, and subsequent closings expected by the end of

the year. The company expects to recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale between $450 million and $550 million. The gain will be recognized consistent with the closing schedule for the transaction.

(a)   Other intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business processes, methodologies and systems. 
 
The net carrying amount of intangible assets increased $265 million during the first half of 2012, primarily due to intangible asset additions resulting from acquisitions, partially offset by amortization. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $318 million and $627 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 respectively, versus $309 million and $619 million for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively.  In addition, in the first half of 2012, the company retired $329 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
 
The amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following at June 30, 2012:

Purchase price adjustments recorded in the first six months of 2012 and full year 2011 were related to acquisitions that were completed on or prior to December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010, respectively, and were still subject to the measurement period that ends at the earlier of 12 months from the acquisition date or when information becomes available. There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the first six months of 2012 or the full year of 2011, and the company has no accumulated impairment losses.

12. Contingencies: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 170 countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
Also, as is typical for companies of IBMs scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the companys pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise.
 
The company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.
 
With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the strength of the companys defenses in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed in this Note, the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the companys experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the companys potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter.
 
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company.
 
The company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of AT&Ts UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux. The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. Motions for summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its decision. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed. On August 25, 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved the appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee of SCO. The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize Novells waiver of SCOs claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district courts ruling and denied SCOs appeal of this matter. In November 2011, SCO filed a motion in Federal Court in Utah seeking to reopen the SCO v. IBM case.

On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social service program processing in Indiana. The State terminated the contract, claiming that IBM was in breach, and the State is seeking damages. IBM believes the States claims against it are without merit and is seeking payment of termination amounts specified in the contract. Trial began in late February 2012 in Marion County, Indiana Superior Court and concluded in early April. On July 18, 2012, the court rejected the States claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs.  The State of Indiana has said it intends to appeal this decision.
 
The company was named as a co-defendant in numerous purported class actions filed on and after March 18, 2011 in federal and state courts in California in connection with an information technology outsourcing agreement between Health Net, Inc. and IBM. The matters were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on July 15, 2011. The consolidated complaint alleges that the company violated the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act in connection with hard drives that are unaccounted for at one of Health Nets data centers in California; plaintiffs have been notified by Health Net that certain of their personal information is believed to be contained on those hard drives. Plaintiffs seek damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. IBM has also received a request for information regarding this matter from the California Attorney General. On January 12, 2012, the court granted IBMs motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing, and on February 22, 2012, the case against IBM was dismissed.
 
IBM United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal proceedings in May 2010 before the High Court in London against the IBM UK Pensions Trust (the UK Trust) and two representative beneficiaries of the UK Trust membership. IBM UK is seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully both in notifying the Trustee of the UK Trust that it was closing its UK defined benefit plans to future accruals for most participants and in implementing the companys new retirement policy. The trial in the High Court is scheduled to begin in February 2013. In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in approximately 290 individual actions brought since early 2010 by participants of the defined benefits plans who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege constructive dismissal and age discrimination, are pending before the Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK and are currently stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced High Court proceedings. In a separate but related proceeding, in March 2011, the Trustee of the IBM UK Trust was granted leave to initiate a claim before the High Court in London against IBM UK and one member of the UK Trust membership, seeking an order modifying certain documents and terms relating to retirement provisions in IBM UKs largest defined benefit plan dating back to 1983.  The trial of these proceedings began in May 2012 and finished in early June. The court has not yet issued its judgment.
 
In March 2011, the company announced that it has agreed to settle a civil enforcement action with the SEC relating to activities by employees of IBM Korea, LG IBM, IBM (China) Investment Company Limited and IBM Global Services (China) Co., Ltd., during the period from 1998 through 2009, allegedly in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. As part of the settlement, IBM has consented to the entry of a judgment relating to the books and records and internal control provisions of the securities laws. IBM has also agreed to pay a total of $10 million, categorized by the SEC as follows: (i) $5.3 million, representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the SECs complaint, (ii) prejudgment interest on that amount of $2.7 million, and (iii) a civil penalty of $2 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.
 
The company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek punitive damages in an unspecified amount.
 
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.

The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. These matters include claims for taxes on the importation of computer software. In November 2008, the company won a significant case in the Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil, and in late July 2009, the company received written confirmation regarding this decision. The total potential amount related to the remaining matters for all applicable years is approximately $550 million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.
 
13. Commitments: The companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $4,927 million and $4,040 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $2,541 million and $2,567 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
 
The company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
The company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other partys claims. While typically indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the companys payment, the companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $54 million and $56 million at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.

14. Subsequent Events: On July 25, 2012, the company issued $1 billion of 10 year fixed rate bonds with a 1.875 percent coupon.
 
On July 31, 2012, the company announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per common share. The dividend is payable September 10, 2012 to shareholders of record on August 10, 2012.

Currency:
 
The references to adjusted for currency or at constant currency in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See Currency Rate Fluctuations on pages 67 and 68 for additional information.
 
Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, the company separated business results into operating and non-operating categories beginning January 1, 2011. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges and retirement-related costs, and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost includes defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and the company considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business.
 
Overall, the company believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the companys pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. For its 2015 earnings per share Road Map, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its

Financial Performance Summary:
 
In the second quarter of 2012, the company reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross, pre-tax and net income margins and delivered double-digit diluted earnings per share growth of 11.3 percent as reported and 13.6 percent on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $4.4 billion in cash from operations in the quarter enabling significant shareholder returns of $4.0 billion in common stock repurchases and dividends. As a result of its performance, in July 2012, the company increased its full year 2012 diluted earnings per share expectation from the expectation disclosed in April 2012 to at least $14.40 per share as reported and at least $15.10 per share for operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share.
 
The financial results demonstrated the strength of the companys business model which is designed to deliver profit and cash on a sustainable basis. All the key elements of the model contributed to performance in the second quarter and in the first half of the year. First, the company has been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value in high growth markets  emerging countries, as well as the other key growth initiatives. In the first half of 2012, the growth market countries delivered revenue growth of 5.3 percent or 9 percent at constant currency. The business analytics portfolio of services and offerings, led by the Global Business Services consulting practice, delivered revenue growth in the first half of 13 percent. In Cloud computing, revenue doubled in the first half compared to the prior year, with contribution from all areas  private cloud, public cloud and the companys industry-based solutions. The Smarter Planet portfolio delivered revenue growth of more than 20 percent in the first half versus the first half of 2011, driven by industry specific solutions and the Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. The company is seeing real performance from its investments in the growth initiatives.
 
Another important and unique aspect of the companys business model is the balance between the annuity and transactional businesses. The annuity businesses  which make up the majority of the services and software businesses and reflect the companys long term relationships with its clients  provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash. A third key element of the business model is the companys ongoing series of initiatives to drive productivity. The company has implemented structural changes that have improved the business and profit margins over time on a sustained, durable basis. In the second quarter and in the first half, the company expanded margins and in 2012 the company will make further

progress toward delivering the productivity savings included in its 2015 roadmap. Lastly, the company continues to grow its cash flows while maintaining a solid balance sheet. In the 12 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated $20.5 billion in cash from operations and $18.0 billion in free cash flow. In 2011, the company generated $19.8 billion in cash from operations and $16.6 billion in free cash flow. In the last decade, the company has significantly increased the cash from operations and tripled the amount of free cash flow generation. This allows the company to continue to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. The combination of the companys strategy and business model enable the company to generate strong profit growth in the current environment.
 
Revenue in the second quarter declined 3.3 percent versus the prior year, but increased 0.5 percent at constant currency. The revenue growth rate at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter constant currency growth rate of 1.0 percent. The company entered the second quarter facing a couple of headwinds. First, the company had a challenging comparison to the second quarter of 2011 that had revenue growth of 12.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency). Second, significant currency dynamics increased throughout the period. Overall, the company estimates that currency impacted its reported revenue in the second quarter by approximately $1 billion or almost 4 points of growth. In spite of these headwinds, the company generated strong profit performance in the period.
 
On a geographic basis, revenue performance was led by the growth markets which increased 2.5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) with the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China delivering growth of 5.0 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency). Across the growth markets, more than 30 countries grew constant currency revenue at a double-digit rate in the quarter. At constant currency, the growth markets outpaced the major markets by 9 points, which declined 4.3 percent as reported and 1 percent at constant currency versus the prior year.
 
Within the companys segments, Software revenue was flat as reported, but up 4 percent adjusted for currency, driven by key branded middleware. Software delivered mid-single digit constant currency growth in Europe and Japan and double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S growth was lower due to very strong performance in the prior year. Software segment pre-tax income increased 7.9 percent versus the prior year. Global Services revenue declined 2.9 percent, but constant currency revenue growth of 1 percent was consistent with the first quarter performance. Global Services again delivered margin expansion in the quarter and combined segment pre-tax income grew 17.9 percent year to year. Systems and Technology revenue declined, as expected, 9.0 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) compared to a very strong growth of 17 percent in the second quarter of 2011. In the second quarter, the company again improved market share in Power Systems driven by competitive displacements.
 
The consolidated gross profit margin increased 1.2 points versus the second quarter of 2011 to 47.6 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin increased 1.5 points to 48.2 percent. The improvement was driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segments, and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of the software business.
 
Total expense and other income decreased 5.1 percent in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other income decreased 5.9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2011. The year-to-year drivers for both categories were approximately:

*   Reflects impacts of translation and hedging programs.
** Includes acquisitions completed in prior 12-month period.
 
Pre-tax income grew 5.7 percent and the pre-tax margin was 20.0 percent, an increase of 1.7 points versus the second quarter of 2011. Net income increased 5.9 percent and the net income margin of 15.1 percent increased 1.3 points year to year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24.8 percent, compared with 25.0 percent in the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income grew 7.9 percent and the pre-tax margin was 21.1 percent, an increase of 2.2 points versus the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) net income increased 7.9 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) net income margin of 15.8 percent increased 1.6 points versus the prior year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate was 25.0 percent versus 25.0 percent in the second quarter of 2011.
 
Diluted earnings per share improved 11.3 percent reflecting the growth in net income and the benefits of the common stock repurchase program. In the second quarter, the company repurchased 15.1 million shares of its common stock. Diluted

earnings per share of $3.34 increased $0.34 from the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.51 increased $0.42 versus the second quarter of 2011 driven by the following factors:

Consistent with the first quarter of 2012, margin expansion was the largest contributor to earnings per share growth. The companys continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvements in gross, pre-tax and net income margins versus the prior year. The contribution from the ongoing share repurchase program was fairly consistent with the first quarter.
 
The company generated $4,435 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $155 million compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven primarily by improved net income ($217 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,683 million increased $1,099 million primarily due to cash used for acquisitions ($499 million), a net increase in capital investments ($326 million) and decreased cash from net sales of marketable securities and other investments ($342 million). Net cash used in financing activities of $3,362 million decreased $1,540 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher cash proceeds from total debt ($1,000 million) and a net decrease in cash used for common stock transactions ($613 million).

At June 30, 2012, the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong and are well-positioned to support the companys objectives. Cash and marketable securities at June 30 were $11,187 million. Key drivers in the balance sheet and total cash flows are highlighted below.
 
Total assets decreased $2,601 million ($1,451 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2011 driven by:
 
·                  Decreases in total receivables ($2,685 million), cash and cash equivalents ($1,058 million) and total deferred taxes ($831 million); partially offset by
·                  Increased goodwill ($1,522 million), short-term marketable securities ($323 million), intangible assets ($265 million) and inventory ($163 million).
 
Total liabilities decreased $2,929 million ($2,188 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2011 driven by:
 
·                  Decreases in retirement and nonpension postretirement ($1,831 million), taxes ($1,130 million), accounts payable ($1,035 million) and compensation and benefits ($443 million); partially offset by
·                  Increased total debt ($1,116 million) and total deferred income ($157 million).
 
Total equity of $20,563 million increased $328 million from December 31, 2011 as a result of:
 
·                  Higher retained earnings ($5,071 million), common stock ($1,028 million) and retirement-related benefit plans ($780 million); partially offset by

Table of Contents
 
·                  Increased treasury stock ($6,153 million) driven by share repurchases, and foreign currency translation adjustments ($385 million).
 
The company generated $8,726 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of $655 million compared to the first six months of 2011, primarily driven by an increase in net income ($421 million), and an increase in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities ($74 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,913 million was $3,827 million higher than the first six months of 2011, primarily due to increased cash used for acquisitions ($1,766 million), decreased proceeds from sales of  marketable securities and other investments ($1,129 million), and increased purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($881 million). Net cash used in financing activities of $5,678 million was $1,539 million lower, compared to the first six months of 2011, primarily due to lower cash used for common stock repurchases ($2,018 million) and increased net proceeds associated with debt ($302 million), partially offset by lower cash provided by common stock transactions ($633 million) and increased dividend payments ($148 million).
 
In January 2012, the company disclosed that it was expecting GAAP earnings of at least $14.16 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $14.85 per diluted share for the full year 2012. In April 2012, the company increased its expectation for GAAP earnings per diluted share to at least $14.27 and its expectation for operating (non-GAAP) earnings per diluted share to at least $15.00 for the full year. In July 2012, the company again increased its expectations for GAAP earnings per diluted share to at least $14.40 and its expectation for operating (non-GAAP) earnings per diluted share to at least $15.10 for the full year.

In the first six months of 2012, total Global Services revenue was $29,335 million, a decrease of 1.2 percent (increase of 1 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, led by performance in the growth markets and the other growth initiatives adjusted for currency.

GTS gross profit increased 4.2 percent in the second quarter and increased 5.3 percent in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011. Gross margin improved 2.3 points in the second quarter and 1.9 points in the first six months versus the prior year. The gross margin expansion was driven primarily by improved profit performance in outsourcing. The disciplined approach GTS has taken to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts has continued to yield benefits in both gross profit and margin, and accounted for approximately one-third of the gross margin expansion in the second quarter. In addition, GTS has very good margin performance in the growth markets, where GTS revenue is growing 10 points better than the major markets at constant currency. Pre-tax income increased 23.7 percent to $1,757 million in the second quarter of 2012 and pre-tax margin expanded 3.6 points year to year to 17.1 percent. GTS pre-tax income in the first six months of 2012 increased 21.8 percent to $3,237 million with a pre-tax margin of 15.7 percent, an increase of 2.9 points year to year. GTS also continues to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency, within the segment, and in conjunction with the companys enterprise productivity initiatives.
 
GBS gross profit increased 2.1 percent in the second quarter of 2012 and increased 1.5 percent in the first six months of 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2011. Gross margin expanded 1.9 points and 1.2 points in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, versus the prior year. The gross margin expansion was driven primarily by improved profit performance in Application Outsourcing. GBS segment pre-tax income returned to a more typical level of profitability in the second quarter. Pre-tax income increased 7.0 percent to $803 million in the second quarter of 2012 with pre-tax margin expanding 1.8 points to 16.6 percent. Segment pre-tax income in the first six months of 2012 increased 1.0 percent to $1,404 million and pre-tax margin increased 0.6 points year to year to 14.5 percent.

Total Global Services backlog includes GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing, Consulting and Systems Integration and Maintenance. Outsourcing backlog includes GTS Outsourcing and GBS Outsourcing. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.
 
Global Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a Global Services contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems Integration contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals.
 
Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Gross margin decreased 2.3 points in the second quarter of 2012 versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower margins in Microelectronics (1.3 points), Storage (0.8 points), System x (0.6 points) and Power Systems (0.4 points), partially offset by margin improvement in System z (0.5 points). Gross margin for the first six months decreased 2.9 points compared to the first six months of 2011. The decrease was driven by lower margins in Storage (1.1 points), Microelectronics (0.9 points), System x (0.6 points), Power Systems (0.4 points) and the effects of revenue mix (0.8 points), partially offset by margin improvement in System z (0.5 points). The margin improvements in System z are typical for this point in the upgrade cycle.
 
Systems and Technologys pre-tax income decreased $159 million (40.4 percent) to $234 million in the second quarter, and decreased $395 million to $130 million for the first six months of 2012, when compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin decreased 2.7 points in the second quarter and 4.2 points in the first six months, respectively, versus the prior year periods.

Total geographic revenue decreased 2.8 percent (increased 1 percent adjusted for currency) to $25,271 million in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted for currency, the revenue growth rate in the second quarter was consistent with the growth rate in the first quarter of 2012.
 
Revenue from the major markets decreased 4.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Within the Americas, Canada decreased 1.3 percent (increased 3 percent adjusted for currency) while the U.S. was essentially flat year to year for the second consecutive quarter. In Europe, revenue performance in the major markets adjusted for currency slowed 2 points compared to the first quarter of 2012 growth rate but, in total, was still relatively stable. Adjusted for currency, performance by country was mixed with the U.K down 1.1 percent (up 2 percent adjusted for currency), Spain down 8.5 percent (up 3 percent adjusted for currency), Germany down 11.0 percent (flat adjusted for currency), France down 15.3 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and Italy down 12.3 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency). Within Asia Pacific, Japan revenue decreased 2.8 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Revenue from the growth markets increased 2.5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2012 and, on a constant currency basis, outpaced the revenue growth in the major markets by 9 points. In the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), revenue increased 5.0 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) led by growth in Russia which increased 35.6 percent (39 percent adjusted for currency) and China where revenue increased 26.1 percent (24 percent adjusted for currency) and the company gained share in the second quarter. In addition, the company is continuing to build capabilities in China and has expanded the number of branch offices. The company now has 68 face-to-face and over 100 virtual branch offices across China. Revenue performance in the growth markets was again broad based with more than 30 growth market countries having double-digit revenue growth year to year, adjusted for currency. The company is capturing the opportunity from these faster growing economies and taking share due in part to the acceleration of its market expansion initiative. This was the 8th consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets.
 
Total geographic revenue for the first six months of 2012 of $49,435 million decreased 1.1 percent (increased 1 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.

Other (income) and expense was income of $132 million and expense of $97 million in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in income of $229 million in the second quarter of 2012 was primarily driven by higher gains from foreign currency transactions ($262 million) due to foreign currency rate volatility year to year. This increase in income was partially offset by increased losses on derivative instruments ($29 million).
 
Other (income) and expense was income of $190 million and $105 million in the first half of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in income of $85 million in the first half of 2012 was primarily driven by higher gains from foreign currency transactions ($430 million) due to foreign currency rate volatility year to year. This increase in income was partially offset by lower gains from securities and investment asset sales ($209 million) and increased losses on derivative instruments ($129 million). In the first quarter of 2011, the company had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily from the sale of Lenovo shares.

The increase in interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 versus the same periods of 2011 was primarily driven by higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. See page 74 for additional information regarding Global Financing debt and interest expense. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 was $249 million and $501 million, respectively, an increase of $14 million and $31 million, respectively, year to year.

In the second quarter, total retirement-related plans cost increased by $91 million compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($156 million) and lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($98 million). Total cost for the first six months of 2012 increased $189 million versus the first six months of 2011, primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($303 million) and lower expected return on plan assets ($110 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($181 million).
 
As discussed in the Snapshot on pages 39 and 40, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter were $454 million, a decrease of $16 million compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily driven by lower service cost of $14 million. Non-operating costs of $94 million increased $107 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year driven primarily by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($156 million) and lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($98 million). For the first six months of 2012, operating retirement-related costs were $968 million, a decrease of $16 million compared to the first six months of 2011. This decrease was driven by lower service cost of $32 million, partially offset by increase in the cost of defined contribution plans of $13 million. Non-operating costs of $197 million increased $205 million in the first six months compared to the prior year driven primarily by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($303 million) and lower expected return on plan assets ($110 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($181 million).
 
See Note 8, Retirement-Related Benefits on pages 30 and 31 for additional plan cost detail.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was 24.8 percent compared to an effective tax rate of 25.0 percent for the second quarter of 2011. The effective tax rates for the first six months of 2012 and 2011 were 22.8 percent and 25.0 percent, respectively.  The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter of 2012 was 25.0 percent compared to 25.0 percent for the second quarter of 2011. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of 2012 was 23.1 percent compared to 25.0 percent for the first six months of 2011. The decline in the rate for the six month period was primarily due to discrete period tax events in the first quarter of 2012 driven by a one-time benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America.
 
With limited exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2007. The years subsequent to 2007 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 increased $65 million in the second quarter and $38 million in the first six months of 2012 to $5,613 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate is $5,127 million at June 30, 2012.
 
In April 2010, the company appealed the determination of a non-U.S. local taxing authority with respect to certain foreign tax losses. The tax benefit of these losses, approximately $1,502 million, has been included in unrecognized tax benefits. This amount includes the portion of these losses that had been utilized against a prior year liability.  In April 2011, the company received notification that the appeal had been denied. In June 2011, the company filed a lawsuit challenging this decision. The first court hearing was held in September 2011 with a second hearing scheduled for October 2012.
 
In October 2011, the IRS commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2008 through 2010.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the second quarter and first six months of 2012 was 59.6 and 62.7 million lower, respectively, than the same periods in 2011, primarily as a result of the companys common stock repurchase program.
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At June 30, 2012, the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong and are well-positioned to support the companys objectives. Cash and marketable securities at June 30 were $11,187 million, and a significant portion of the investment portfolio was invested in U.S. and Canadian sovereign instruments, with no holdings of European sovereign debt securities. Total debt of $32,435 million increased $1,116 million from prior year-end levels driven by an increase in total debt of $7,559 million due to new debt issuances, partially offset by maturities of $4,068 million and a decrease in commercial paper to $250 million compared to $2,300 million at December 31, 2011. The company continues to have substantial flexibility in the market. In the first six months, the company generated $8,726 million in cash from operations, an increase of $655 million compared to the first six months of 2011 (see cash flow analysis on page 64). The company has

consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its $10 billion global credit facility. The companys strong cash flow and substantial cash position permits the company to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.
 
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts appearing in the separate Global Financing section, beginning on page 70, are supplementary data presented to facilitate an understanding of the Global Financing business.

·                  An increase of $163 million ($187 million adjusted for currency) in inventories, primarily in Systems and Technology.
 
Current liabilities decreased $3,220 million ($2,911 million adjusted for currency), as a result of:
 
·                  A decrease of $1,130 million in taxes payable primarily due to tax payments in the U.S. and Japan;
 
·                  A decrease in short-term debt of $793 million primarily driven by the following:
 
·                  Payments of $3,391 million; and
·                  Payments of debt less than 90 days of $2,236 million; partially offset by
·                  Reclasses of  $2,576 million from long-term to short-term debt to reflect maturity dates; and
·                  New debt issuances of $2,307 million.
 
·                  A decrease in accounts payable of $1,035 million reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances; and
 
·                  A decrease in compensation and benefits of $443 million reflecting payments of 2011 employee bonuses in March 2012.

Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 74.
 
Given the significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is more representative of the companys core business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
Core debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was 36.1 percent at June 30, 2012 compared to 32.0 percent at December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in non-Global Financing debt of $1,823 million partially offset by an increase in non-Global Financing equity of $365 million from December 31, 2011 balances.
 
Consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2012 was 61.2 percent versus 60.7 percent at December 31, 2011.
 
Debt Exchange
 
During the quarter, the company completed an exchange of approximately $6 million of principal of its 7.125 percent debentures due 2096, $104 million principal of its 8.000 percent notes due in 2038 and $800 million of principal of its 5.600 percent senior notes due in 2039 for approximately $1,107 million of 4.000 percent senior notes due in 2042 and cash of approximately $121 million.  The exchange was completed to retire high coupon debt in the current favorable interest rate environment.
 
The debt exchange was accounted for as a non revolving debt modification in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and therefore it did not result in any gain or loss recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  Cash payments will be amortized over the life of the new debt. Administrative fees with third parties in relation to the exchange were expensed as incurred.

Equity
 
Total equity increased by $328 million from December 31, 2011 as a result of an increase in retained earnings of $5,071 million, an increase of $1,028 million in common stock and accumulated other comprehensive income of $387 million, partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $6,153 million primarily related to common stock repurchases in the first six months of 2012.
 
Looking Forward
 
The company measures the success of its business model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The companys strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term performance.
 
In May 2010, the company met with investors and introduced a roadmap for earnings per share in 2015. The objective of the roadmap for growth is to achieve at least $20 of operating (non-GAAP) earnings per diluted share in 2015. The company has identified the major drivers of financial performance: revenue growth, margin expansion and common stock share repurchase. The revenue growth will come from a combination of base revenue growth, a shift to faster growing businesses and from acquisitions closed between 2010 and 2015. The contribution from margin expansion will be driven by the mix of higher margin businesses and enterprise productivity. The company will also continue to return value to its shareholders, with approximately $50 billion of share repurchase and $20 billion of dividends expected during the road map period. Overall, the company expects fairly balanced contribution from revenue growth, margin expansion and share repurchase.
 
Looking forward, the company expects continued opportunity in the growth markets and in the higher value solutions, including business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud computing, where the company believes its enterprise clients will continue to focus. The company is confident in its ability to continue to leverage its business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. In January 2012, the company disclosed that it was expecting GAAP earnings of at least $14.16 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $14.85 per diluted share for the full year 2012.  In April 2012, the company increased its expectation for GAAP earnings per diluted share to at least $14.27 and its expectation for operating (non-GAAP) earnings per diluted share to at least $15.00 for the full year. In July 2012, the company again increased its expectation for GAAP earnings per diluted share to at least $14.40 and its expectation for operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to at least $15.10 for the full year. The operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share expectation excludes acquisition-related charges of $0.46 per share and non-operating retirement-related costs of $0.24 per share. This expectation results in an increase year to year of 10 percent in GAAP earnings per share and an increase of 12 percent year to year in operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share.
 
The companys revised earnings per share expectation for the full year implies year to year growth in the second half of 9 percent for GAAP earnings per share and 10 percent for operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share. The company expects that growth to be reasonably distributed across both the third and fourth quarters, with the possibility of a slight skew towards the fourth quarter due to its new product announcements. The company expects currency dynamics in the second half to be a headwind of approximately 4-5 points of revenue growth in the third quarter and 2-3 points in the fourth quarter. At July 2012 spot rates, this would be an impact of approximately $2 billion in the second half compared to the estimated impact of $1 billion that the company experienced in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the company expects constant currency revenue growth to be approximately the same as the first half of the year, with the fourth quarter presenting an opportunity for additional growth driven by the new product announcements.
 
From a segment perspective, in the first half of 2012, the Global Services business increased pre-tax income by 14.6 percent, expanded pre-tax margin by 2.1 points and maintained a flat backlog, adjusted for currency, versus the prior year. Looking forward to the second half of the year, the company expects the Global Services business to deliver continued strong profit growth. The Software business delivered strong performance in the first half, capitalizing on the momentum and a strong set of opportunities it had coming off an excellent performance in 2011. The company continues to strengthen the portfolio through a series of acquisitions that will contribute to performance in future periods. The company also continues to see good opportunity in the global software business and expects to hire 200-300 sales representatives each month through the end of the year. Revenue performance in the second quarter was impacted by the comparison to the strong performance in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, the company expects a Software revenue growth rate consistent with the first quarter of 2012. As expected, the Systems and Technology business faced a tough comparison in the first half of 2012 driven primarily by the System z and Power Systems product cycle performance in the first half of 2011. In the second quarter, the company began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from the new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems which was announced in April 2012. In the third quarter, the PureApplication system will become available, and the company expects volume shipments in the fourth quarter.

The companys earnings expectation for 2012 is consistent with its business model: revenue growth, margin expansion driven by a mix to software and continued productivity and prudent use of cash to drive investments, acquisitions and share repurchase. The company will continue to improve its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures and will continue to invest in market opportunities and drive productivity. The company expects to close the sale of its Retail Store Solutions business to Toshiba Tec in the third and fourth quarters and expects to record a total pre-tax gain on this transaction of approximately $450 - $550 million in the second half of the year. The gain will be recognized consistent with the closing schedule.
 
The company will continue to rebalance its workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with its key investments and hire resources to drive growth initiatives. The company expects workforce rebalancing charges in the second half of 2012 to be slightly greater than the first half of 2012 and to be focused on the companys non-U.S. operations.
 
The companys effective tax rate in the first six months was 22.8 percent, down 2.2 points compared to the first six months of 2011. The lower tax rate was due to a one-time benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America in the first quarter. The company expects its full year  2012 effective tax rate on an as reported and operating (non-GAAP) basis to be in the range of 24 percent; excluding the one-time benefit in the first quarter, the effective tax rate on an as reported and operating (non-GAAP) basis to be in the range of 25 percent.
 
The company expects 2012 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $500 million compared to 2011. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2011. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion, approximately flat versus 2011. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.4 billion versus income of $0.1 billion in 2011.
 
The economy could impact the credit quality of the companys receivables, and therefore the allowance for credit losses. The company will continue to apply its rigorous credit policies and analysis, and will also continue to monitor the current economic environment, particularly in Europe. At June 30, 2012, total receivables in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain were approximately $2.3 billion, net of allowances, and represented approximately 6 percent of total net trade and financing accounts receivables.  The company will continue to monitor potential exposures in these countries in conjunction with the application of its credit policies.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys financial results and financial position. At June 30, 2012, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2011. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears in the companys 2011 Annual Report in Note D, Financial Instruments, on pages 96 to 100.
 
Foreign currency fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results.
 
The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results using the comparable prior periods currency conversion rate. However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management may take in reaction to fluctuating currency rates.  Based on the currency rate movements in the first half of 2012, total revenue decreased 1.6 percent as reported and increased 0.8 percent at constant currency versus the first half of 2011. On a pre-tax income basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) decrease of approximately $50 million in the first half of 2012. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $370 million in the first half of 2011. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging

Table of Contents
 
instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. The company continues to monitor the economic conditions in Venezuela. On December 30, 2010, the official rate for essential goods was eliminated, with no change to the SITME rate. The SITME rate remained constant throughout 2011 and the first six months of 2012. Future gains or losses from devaluation of the SITME rate are not expected to have a material impact given the size of the companys operations in Venezuela (less than 1 percent of total 2010 and 2011 revenue, respectively).
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
In the companys 2011 Annual Report, on pages 56 to 58, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table presented on page 56 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2012, those amounts are $8.7 billion for net cash from operating activities, $11.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30, 2012 appear in the table below. The Standard and Poors ratings reflect an upgrade on May 30, 2012. The other agency ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2011. The companys debt securities do not contain any acceleration clauses which could change the scheduled maturities of the obligation. In addition, the company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments there under in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At June 30, 2012, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $512 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

Free cash flow for the first six months of 2012 increased $1,370 million versus the first six months of 2011. The increase was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. In the 12 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated $20.5 billion in cash from operations and $18.0 billion in free cash flow. In 2011, the company generated $19.8 billion in cash from operations and $16.6 billion in free cash flow. In the last decade, the company has significantly increased the cash from operations and tripled the amount of free cash flow generation.

Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the companys 2011  Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 12, Contingencies, on pages 34 to 37 of this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $700 million in 2012. The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.
 
The companys U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The companys U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options available. These options include the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and calling intercompany loans that are in place with certain foreign subsidiaries.
 
The company does earn a significant amount of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The companys policy is to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional U.S tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for operations and obligations in the U.S., the company could elect to repatriate these funds which could result in a reassessment of the companys policy and increased tax expense.

The decrease in revenue in the second quarter, as compared to the same period in 2011, was due to:
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 5.7 percent driven by decreases in financing revenue (down 10.3 percent to $119 million) and in used equipment sales (down 4.3 percent to $396 million); and
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 0.4 percent (up 4 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in financing revenue (down 10.0 percent to $359 million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales (up 31.5 percent to $157 million).
 
The decrease in revenue in the first six months, as compared to the same period in 2011, was due to:
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 4.2 percent driven by decreases in financing revenue (down 8.8 percent to $260 million) and in used equipment sales (down 2.4 percent to $740 million); and
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 2.8 percent (flat adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in financing revenue (down 7.6 percent to $751 million), partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales (up 14.9 percent to $255 million).
 
The decreases in external financing revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, were due to lower asset yields.  The decreases in internal financing revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, were due to decreases in average asset balances and lower asset yields.
 
Global Financing gross profit decreased 0.7 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to a decrease in financing gross profit, partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales gross profit. Gross margin increased 1.6 points due primarily to an increase in financing margin, partially offset by a decrease in used equipment sales margin.  Global Financing gross profit decreased 0.8 percent in the first six months of 2012 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in financing gross profit, partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales gross profit.  Gross margin increased 1.8 points due to an improvement in both financing and used equipment sales margins.
 
Global Financing pre-tax income increased 6.4 percent to $528 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same period in 2011. The increase was driven by decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses ($28 million), financing receivables provisions ($4 million) and other expenses ($5 million), partially offset by the decrease in gross profit of $5 million.  The decrease in financing receivables provisions was driven by lower reserve requirements in the current year.  Global Financing pre-tax income increased 2.4 percent in the first six months of 2012 compared to the prior year, driven by decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses ($44 million) and other expenses ($3 million), partially offset by an

increase in financing receivables provisions of $12 million and the decrease in gross profit of $11 million. The increase in financing receivables provisions was due to lower reserve requirements in the prior year.
 
The increases in return on equity for the second quarter and for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 were driven by higher after-tax income and a lower equity balance.

Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM systems, software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for systems products, as well as loans for systems, software and services with terms generally from one to seven years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and services and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks in the loan agreements which include covenants to protect against credit deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client financing also includes internal activity as described on page 24 of the companys 2011 Annual Report.
 
Commercial financing receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.  These short-term receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
At June 30, 2012, substantially all financing assets are IT related assets, and approximately 61 percent of the external portfolio is with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers or mortgage assets.

Cash collections of commercial financing assets exceeded new financing originations, which resulted in a net decline in financing assets in the second quarter of 2012 from March 31, 2012.  New financing originations of client financing assets were also offset by cash collections in the second quarter of 2012.  Cash collections of both commercial and client financing assets exceeded new financing originations in the first six months of 2012, which resulted in a net decline in financing assets from December 31, 2011. The increase in originations in both periods in the table above was due to improving volumes in client and commercial financing.
 
Cash generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and dividends to IBM.

*   Represents reserved receivables, net of recoveries, that were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents translation adjustments.
 
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved remained at 1.3 percent for periods ending December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2012.  Specific reserves decreased 6 percent from $226 million at December 31, 2011 to $212 million at June 30, 2012.  Unallocated reserves decreased 6 percent from $124 million at December 31, 2011 to $116 million at June 30, 2012 due primarily to the decline in gross financing receivables.
 
Global Financings bad debt expense was a decrease of $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to a decrease of $22 million for the same period in 2011. The year-to-year increase in bad debt expense was primarily attributed to lower reserve requirements in the prior year.  In the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011, bad debt expense decreased $4 million.  The year-to-year decrease in bad debt expense was primarily attributed to lower reserve requirements in the current year.

Residual Value
 
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global Financing optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment returned at the end of a lease, represented 53.6 percent and 49.6 percent of Global Financings revenue in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, of 2012 and 50.1 percent and 47.2 percent in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, of 2011. The gross margins on these sales were 54.5 percent and 55.2 percent in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease was driven by a shift in mix toward lower margin external equipment sales, partially offset by an increase in the external sales margin. The gross margins were 56.6 percent and 55.6 percent for the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase was driven by the increases in both external and internal equipment sales margins, partially offset by a shift in mix toward lower margin external equipment sales.
 
The table below presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2012 and June 30, 2012. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at June 30, 2012 is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While primarily focused on IBM products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM products. These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from declines in equipment values for these assets.
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees for sales-type leases were $115 million and $254 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and $286 million and $436 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $9 million and $11 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and $19 million for the financing transactions originated during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011. The cost of guarantees was $0.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 and $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, and $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011.

The company funds Global Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 71.
 
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on pages 70 and 71 and in Segment Information on pages 25 to 27.
 
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal loans and leases at arms-length pricing in support of Global Services long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business model.

Looking Forward
 
Global Financings financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financings assets and new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services financed to the companys clients and business partners, and substantially all financing assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future growth. Global Financings offerings are competitive and available to clients as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access to the capital markets. Overall, Global Financings originations will be dependent upon the demand for IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
IBM continues to access both the short-term commercial paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets.  A protracted period where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in originations.
 
Interest rates and the overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact the credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 73, Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the global economy.
 
GAAP Reconciliation
 
The tables below provide a reconciliation of the companys income statement results as reported under GAAP to its operating earnings presentation which is a non-GAAP measure. The companys calculation of operating earnings, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Please refer to the Snapshot section beginning on page 39 for the companys rationale for presenting operating earnings information.
