NOTE
2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Principle
of consolidation
 
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Green New
Jersey, Jinong, Gufeng, Tianjuyuan, and the VIE Companies. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
 
Effective
June 16, 2013, Yuxing was converted from being a wholly-owned foreign enterprise 100% owned by Jinong to a domestic enterprise
100% owned one natural person, who is not affiliated to the Company (“Yuxing’s Owner”). Effective the same day,
Yuxing’s Owner entered into a series of contractual agreements with Jinong pursuant to which Yuxing became the VIE of Jinong.
 
VIE
assessment
 
A
VIE is an entity (1) that has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other entities, (2) where the group of equity holders does not have the power to direct the activities
of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, or the obligation to absorb the entity’s
expected losses or the right to receive the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, or (3) where the voting rights
of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to receive
the expected residual returns of the entity, or both, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either involve or
are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. In order to determine if an entity is considered
a VIE, the Company first performs a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding its assessments,
including, but not limited to, the design of the entity, the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along
to its interest holders, the rights of the parties, and the purpose of the arrangement. If the Company cannot conclude after a
qualitative analysis whether an entity is a VIE, it performs a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis considered the
design of the entity, the risks that cause variability, the purpose for which the entity was created, and the variability that
the entity was designed to pass along to its variable interest holders. When the primary beneficiary could not be identified through
a qualitative analysis, we used internal cash flow models to compute and allocate expected losses or expected residual returns
to each variable interest holder based upon the relative contractual rights and preferences of each interest holder in the VIE’s
capital structure.
 
Use
of estimates
 
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the
estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results.
 
Cash
and cash equivalents and concentration of cash
 
For
statement of cash flows purposes, the Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit with state owned
banks in the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”) and banks in the United States, and other highly-liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains large sums of
cash in three major banks in China. The aggregate cash in such accounts and on hand as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019
were $78,603,561 and $72,178,448, respectively. There is no insurance securing these deposits in China. In addition, the Company
also had $102,939 and $81,356 in cash in two banks in the United States as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 respectively.
Cash overdraft as of balance sheet date will be reflected as liabilities in the balance sheet. The Company has not experienced
any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts.
 
Accounts
receivable
 
The
Company’s policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management regularly reviews
the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves at each year-end. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off
through a charge to the valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, the Company had accounts receivable of
$156,080,809 and $145,190,160, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $27,999,039 and $33,515,410, respectively. The Company
adopts no policy to accept product returns after the sales delivery.
 

7
 

  
Inventories
 
Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average basis) or market. Inventories consist of raw materials, work
in process, finished goods and packaging materials. The Company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods
and establishes reserves when determined necessary. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no reserve for obsolete goods.
 
Intangible
Assets
 
The
Company records intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group at fair value. Intangible assets with definitive
lives are amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute
directly or indirectly to the entity’s future cash flows. The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least
annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Whenever
any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value. The Company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
 
Customer
deposits
 
Payments
received before all the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as customer deposits. When all revenue
recognition criteria are met, the customer deposits are recognized as revenue. As of December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, the
Company had customer deposits of $7,525,826 and $6,514,619, respectively.
 
Earnings
per share
 
Basic
earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.
 
The
components of basic and diluted earnings per share consist of the following:

Recent
accounting pronouncements
 
Leases:
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-2”), which provides guidance on lease
amendments to the FASB Accounting Standard Codification. This ASU will be effective for us beginning in May 1, 2019. We are currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-2 on our consolidated financial statements.
 
Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326): The amendments in this Update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis
to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendments broaden the information that an entity must consider
in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted
information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss, which will be more decision useful to
users of the financial statements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is allowed as of the fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will
have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
  
Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company’s present or future financial statements.
 
Income
Tax: In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05 which amends ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” to provide guidance
on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”) pursuant
to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“SAB
118”), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Under SAB 118, companies are able to record
a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act if one is able to be determined and report it as a provisional amount during
the measurement period. The measurement period is not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date.

Company determined that the fair value of the convertible notes payable was RMB 12,923,191 ($1,855,770) and RMB 51,629,859 ($7,414,048)
as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Aside from the forfeiture of the convertible notes previously issued
to Zhenbai’s shareholders and the matured convertible notes on June, 2019, the difference between the fair value of the
notes and the face amount of the notes is being amortized to accretion implied interest expense over the three-year life of the
notes. As of December 31, 2019, the accumulated amortization of this discount into accretion expenses was $1,375,511.

NOTE
11 – TAXES PAYABLE
 
Enterprise
Income Tax
 
Effective
January 1, 2008, the Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) law of the PRC replaced the tax laws for Domestic Enterprises (“DEs”)
and Foreign Invested Enterprises (“FIEs”). The EIT rate of 25% replaced the 33% rate that was applicable to both DEs
and FIEs. The two-year tax exemption and three-year 50% tax reduction tax holiday for production-oriented FIEs was eliminated.
Since January 1, 2008, Jinong became subject to income tax in China at a rate of 15% as a high-tech company, because of the expiration
of its tax exemption on December 31, 2007. Accordingly, it made provision for income taxes for the six-month period ended December
31, 2019 and 2018 of $-857,195 and $1,359,998, respectively.  Gufeng is subject to a 25% EIT rate and thus it made provision
for income taxes of $-136,291 and $1,071,227 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Value-Added
Tax
 
All
of the Company’s fertilizer products that are produced and sold in the PRC were subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT)
of 13% of the gross sales price. On April 29, 2008, the PRC State of Administration of Taxation (SAT) released Notice #56, “Exemption
of VAT for Organic Fertilizer Products”, which allows certain fertilizer products to be exempt from VAT beginning June
1, 2008. The Company submitted the application for exemption in May 2009, which was granted effective September 1, 2009, continuing
through December 31, 2015. On August 10, 2015 and August 28, 2015, the SAT released Notice #90. “Reinstatement of VAT
for Fertilizer Products”, and Notice #97, “Supplementary Reinstatement of VAT for Fertilizer Products”,
which restore the VAT of 13% of the gross sales price on certain fertilizer products includes non-organic fertilizer products
starting from September 1, 2015, but granted taxpayers a reduced rate of 3% from September 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.
 
On
April 28, 2017, the PRC State of Administration of Taxation (SAT) released Notice 2017 #37, “Notice on Policy of Reduced
Value Added Tax Rate,” under which, effective July 1, 2017, all of the Company’s fertilizer products that are
produced and sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 11% of the gross sales price. The tax rate was
reduced 2% from 13%.
 
On
April 4, 2018, the PRC State of Administration of Taxation (SAT) released Notice 2018 #32, “Notice on Adjustment of VAT
Tax Rate,” under which, effective May 1, 2018, all of the Company’s fertilizer products that are produced and
sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 10% of the gross sales price. The tax rate was reduced 1% from
11%.
 
On
March 20, 2019, the PRC State of Administration of Taxation (SAT) released Notice 2019 #39, “Announcement on Policies
Concerning Deepening the Reform of Value Added Tax,” under which, effective April 1, 2019, all of the Company’s
fertilizer products that are produced and sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 9% of the gross sales
price. The tax rate was reduced 1% from 10%.

NOTE
16 – VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
 
In
accordance with accounting standards regarding consolidation of variable interest entities, VIEs are generally entities that lack
sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders
lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which a company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary
of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.

Overview
 
We
are engaged in research, development, production and sale of various types of fertilizers and agricultural products in the PRC
through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiaries, Jinong and Gufeng (including Gufeng’s subsidiary Tianjuyuan), and our VIE,
Yuxing. Our primary business is fertilizer products, specifically humic-acid based compound fertilizer produced by Jinong and
compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizer, highly-concentrated water-soluble
fertilizer and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer produced by Gufeng. In addition, through Yuxing, we develop and produce
various agricultural products, such as top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings. For financial reporting purposes,
our operations are organized into three business segments: fertilizer products (Jinong), fertilizer products (Gufeng) and agricultural
products production (Yuxing).
 
The
fertilizer business conducted by Jinong and Gufeng generated approximately 84.1% and 72.0% of our total revenues for the six months
Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The sales VIEs generated 23.1% and 23.5% of our revenues for the six months Ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Yuxing serves as a research and development base for our fertilizer products.

Strategic
Acquisitions
 
On
June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, through Jinong, we entered into (i) Strategic Acquisition Agreements (the “SAA”),
and (ii) Agreements for Convertible Notes (the “ACN”), with the shareholders of the companies as identified below
(the “Targets”).

(1)The
exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars on January 1, 2017 is RMB1=US$0.144, according to the exchange rate published by Bank
of China.

 
Pursuant
to the SAA and the ACN, the shareholders of the Targets, while retaining possession of the equity interests and continuing to
be the legal owners of such interests, agreed to pledge and entrust all of their equity interests, including the proceeds thereof
but excluding any claims or encumbrances, and the operations and management of its business to Jinong, in exchange of an aggregate
amount of RMB45,000,000 (approximately $6,462,000) to be paid by Jinong within three days following the execution of the SAA,
ACN and the VIE Agreements, and convertible notes with an aggregate face value of RMB 63,000,000 (approximately $9,046,800) with
an annual fixed compound interest rate of 3% and term of three years.
 
Jinong
acquired the Targets using the VIE arrangement based on our need to further develop our business and comply with the regulatory
requirements under the PRC laws.
 
As
our business focuses on the production of fertilizer, all our business activities intertwine with those in the agriculture industry
in China. Specifically, we deal with compliance, regulation, safety, inspection, and licenses in fertilizer production, farm land
use and transfer, growing and distribution of agriculture goods, agriculture basic supplies, seeds, pesticides, and trades of
grains. It is an industry in which heavy regulations get implemented and strictly enforced. In addition, E-commerce, which is
also under strict government regulation in the PRC, has lately become a sales and distribution channel for agricultural products.
Currently, we are developing an online platform to connect the physical distribution network we either own or lease.
 
Compared
with the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions, the regulatory environment in the PRC is unique. For example, the “M&A
Rules” purports to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or
individuals and formed for purposes of overseas listing through acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies
or individuals obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) prior to the listing
and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC
published procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles.
 
For
both e-commerce and agriculture industries, PRC regulators limit the investment from foreign entities and set particularly rules
for foreign-owned entities to conduct business. We expect these limitations on foreign-owned entities will continue to exist in
e-commerce and agriculture industries. The VIE arrangement, however, provides feasibility for obtaining administrative approval
process and avoiding industry restrictions that can be imposed on an entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign entity.
The VIE agreements reduce uncertainty and the current limitation risk. It is our understanding that the VIE agreements, as well
as the control we obtained through VIE arrangement, are valid and enforceable. Such legal structure does not violate the known,
published, and current PRC laws. While there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC
Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that the PRC authorities will take a view that is not
contrary to or otherwise different from our belief and understanding stated above, we believe the substantial difficulty that
we experienced previously to conduct business in agriculture as a foreign ownership can be greatly reduced by the VIE arrangement.
Further, as an integral part of the VIE arrangement, the underlying equity pledge agreements provide legal protection for the
control we obtained. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, we have completed the equity pledge processes with the Targets
to ensure the complete control of the interests in the Targets. The shareholders of the Targets are not entitled to transfer any
shares to a third party under the exclusive option agreements. If necessary, they may transfer shares to our company without consideration.
 
While
the VIE arrangement provides us with the feasibility to conduct our business in the E-Commerce and agriculture industries, validity
and enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, (ii) possible judicial or administrative actions or any
PRC Laws affecting creditors’ rights, (iii) certain equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the validity and
enforceability of contractual rights generally under concepts of public interest, interests of the State, national security, reasonableness,
good faith and fair dealing, and applicable statutes of limitation; (iv) any circumstance in connection with formulation, execution
or implementation of any legal documents that would be deemed materially mistaken, clearly unconscionable, fraudulent, coercive
at the conclusions thereof; and (v) judicial discretion with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses,
the calculation of damages, the entitlement to attorney’s fees and other costs, and the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction
of any court or from legal process. Validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is also subject to risk derived from the discretion
of any competent PRC legislative, administrative or judicial bodies in exercising their authority in the PRC. As a result, there
can no assurance that any of such PRC Laws will not be changed, amended or replaced in the immediate future or in the longer term
with or without retrospective effect.

Discussion
of Segment Profitability Measures
 
As
of December 31, 2019, we were engaged in the following businesses: the production and sale of fertilizers through Jinong and Gufeng,
the production and sale of high-quality agricultural products by Yuxing, and the sales of agriculture materials by the sales VIEs.
For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized into four main business segments based on locations and products:
Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production) and Yuxing (agricultural products production) and the sales VIEs.
Each of the segments has its own annual budget about development, production and sales.
 

33
 

 
Each
of the four operating segments referenced above has separate and distinct general ledgers. The chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”) makes decisions with respect to resources allocation and performance assessment upon receiving financial
information, including revenue, gross margin, operating income and net income produced from the various general ledger systems;
however, net income by segment is the principal benchmark to measure profit or loss adopted by the CODM.
 
For
Jinong, the net income decreased by $12,547,097, or 163.2%, to $4,857,441 for six months ended December 31, 2019, from $7,689,656
for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was principally due to the increase in general and administrative expense.
 
For
Gufeng, the net income decreased by $36,046,354, or 1264.1%, to $(33,194,889) for six months ended December 31, 2019 from $2,851,465
for six months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was principally due to the increase in general and administrative expense.
 
For
Yuxing, the net income increased $3,898,846, or 108.2%, to $295,498 for six months ended December 31, 2019 from $(3,603,348) for
six months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in general and administrative expense.
 
For
the sales VIEs, the net income was $4,223,709 for period ended December 31, 2019, increased by $ 2,270,716, or 116.3%, from $1,952,993
for six months ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses for
the sales VIEs.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
Our
principal sources of liquidity include cash from operations, borrowings from local commercial banks and net proceeds of offerings
of our securities.
 
As
of December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents were $78,706,500, an increase of $6,446,696, or 8.9%, from $72,259,804 as of June
30, 2019.
 
We
intend to use some of the remaining net proceeds from our securities offerings, as well as other working capital if required,
to acquire new businesses, upgrade production lines and complete Yuxing’s new greenhouse facilities for agriculture products
located on 88 acres of land in Hu County, 18 kilometers southeast of Xi’an city. Yuxing purchased a set of agricultural
products testing equipment for the year of 2016. We believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow
from operations to support our business growth for the next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions
or expansions. However, if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required
to seek additional capital and/or to reduce certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to achieve our business objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion
purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous, which may include additional debt and/or equity financings.
There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any equity financing
may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants.
 
The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:
 

 
Operating
Activities
 
Net
cash used in operating activities was $2,074,331 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $25,368,731, or 92.4%,
from cash provided by operating activities of $27,443,062 for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly
due to decrease in advances to suppliers and decrease in inventories during the six months ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to the same period in 2018.
 

34
 

 
Investing
Activities
 
Net
cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2019 was $50,533, compared to cash used in investing activities
of $41,067 for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The difference was due to the company had less change in construction in
process during the last six months compared to the same period last year.
 
Financing
Activities
 
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2019 was $10,939,200, compared to $219,722 net cash
used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018, which was largely attribute to $10,252,000 proceeds from
the sale of common stock for the six months ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0 in the same period last year.
 
As
of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, our loans payable were as follows:
 

 
Accounts
Receivable 
 
We
had accounts receivable of $156,080,809 as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $145,190,160 as of June 30, 2019, an increase
of $10,890,649, or 7.5%. The increase was primarily attributable to Gufeng’s accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2019,
Gufeng’s accounts receivable was $91,371,408, an increase of $5,939,245, or 7.0%, compared to $85,432,163 as of June 30,
2019.
 
Allowance
for doubtful accounts in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019 was $27,999,039, a decrease of $5,516,371, or 16.5%, from
$33,515,410 as of June 30, 2019. And the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable was 15.2% as of
December 31, 2019 and 18.8% as of June 30, 2019.
 
Deferred
assets
 
We
had no deferred assets as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019. During the six months, we assisted the distributors in certain
marketing efforts and developing standard stores to expand our competitive advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor
agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts and store development will be expensed over three
years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement
with us earlier than the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the amount owed by the distributor is payable to us immediately. The
deferred assets had been fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.
 
Inventories
 
We
had inventories of $114,448,765 as of December 31, 2019, as compared to $162,013,889 as of June 30, 2019, a decrease of $47,565,124,
or 29.4%. The decrease was primarily attributable to Gufeng’s inventory. As of December 31, 2019, Gufeng’s inventory
was $91,994,547, compared to $141,210,160 as of June 30, 2019, a decrease of $49,215,613, or 34.9%.
 
Advances
to Suppliers
 
We
had advances to suppliers of $30,944,718 as of December 31, 2019 as compared to $32,713,817 as of June 30, 2019, representing
a decrease of $1,769,099, or 5.4%. Our inventory level may fluctuate from time to time, depending how quickly the raw material
is consumed and replenished during the production process, and how soon the finished goods are sold. The replenishment of raw
material relies on management’s estimate of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the raw materials future
price, and spot price along with its volatility, as well as the seasonal demand and future price of finished fertilizer products.
Such estimate may not be accurate, and the purchase decision of raw materials based on the estimate can cause excessive inventories
in times of slow sales and insufficient inventories in peak times.

Accounts
Payable
 
We
had accounts payable of $15,217,368 as of December 31, 2019 as compared to $19,004,548 as of June 30, 2019, representing a decrease
of $3,787,180, or 19.9%. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of accounts payable for VIEs. They have accounts payable
of $13,460,898 as of December 31, 2019 as compared to $17,073,229 as of June 30, 2019, representing a decrease of $3,612,331,
or 21.2%.

Revenue (Customer Deposits)
 
We
had customer deposits of $7,525,826 as of December 31, 2019 as compared to $6,514,619 as of June 30, 2019, representing an increase
of $1,011,207, or 15.5%. The increase was mainly attributable to Gufeng’s $5,617,481 unearned revenue as of December 31,
2019, compared to $4,668,972 unearned revenue as of June 30, 2019, increased $948,509, or 20.3%, caused by the advance deposits
made by clients. This increase was due to seasonal fluctuation and we expect to deliver products to our customers during the next
three months at which time we will recognize the revenue.
 
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Management’s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial statements reflect
the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. See
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
We believe that the following paragraphs reflect the most critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition
and results of operations:
 
Use
of estimates
 
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the
estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
 
Revenue
recognition
 
Sales
revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable,
the delivery is completed, we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received
before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.
 
Our
revenue consists of invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (VAT). No product return or sales discount allowance is
made as products delivered and accepted by customers are normally not returnable and sales discounts are normally not granted
after products are delivered.
 
Cash
and cash equivalents
 
For statement of cash flows purposes, we
consider all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.
 
Accounts
receivable
 
Our
policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts
receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and
changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Any accounts receivable of Jinong and Gufeng
that are outstanding for more than 180 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts, and any accounts receivable of Yuxing
that are outstanding for more than 90 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts.
 

36
 

 
Deferred
assets
 
Deferred
assets represent amounts the Company advanced to the distributors in their marketing and stores development to expand our competitive
advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing
efforts and store development will be expensed over three years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor
defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the realization of the contractual terms, the unamortized
portion of the amount owed by the distributor is to be refunded to us immediately. The deferred assets had been fully amortized
as of December 31, 2019.
 
Segment
reporting
 
FASB
ASC 280 requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based
on the way a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other way management
disaggregates a company.
 
As
of December 31, 2019, we were organized into ten main business units: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer
production), Yuxing (agricultural products production), Lishijie (agriculture sales), Jinyangguang (agriculture sales), Wangtian
(agriculture sales), Xindeguo (agriculture sales), Xinyulei (agriculture sales), Fengnong (agriculture sales) and Xiangrong (agriculture
sales). For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized into four main business segments based on locations and
products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production) and Yuxing (agricultural products production) and the
sales VIEs. Each of the segments has its own annual budget regarding development, production and sales. 
 
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
Disclosures
About Market Risk
 
We
may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business. Market risk generally represents the
risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices. We currently do not, in the normal course
of business, use financial instruments that are subject to changes in financial market conditions.
 
Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk
 
Substantially
all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in RMB. However, we use the U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes. Conversion
of RMB into foreign currencies is regulated by the People’s Bank of China through a unified floating exchange rate system.
Although the PRC government has stated its intention to support the value of RMB, there can be no assurance that such exchange
rate will not again become volatile or that RMB will not devalue significantly against U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations
may adversely affect the value, in U.S. dollar terms, of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the PRC.
 
Our
reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Except for U.S. holding companies, all of our consolidated revenues, consolidated costs
and expenses, and our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and
results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates
against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements
will decline. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates, revenues and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rates, and shareholders’ equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income,
a component of shareholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2019, our accumulated other comprehensive loss was $27 million.
We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. The value of the
RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC’s political and economic
conditions. Between July 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, China’s currency dropped by a cumulative 1.6% against the U.S. dollar,
making Chinese exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive by that percentage. The effect on trade can be substantial.
Moreover, it is possible that in the future, the PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate
and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
We
deposit surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. All
of our outstanding debt instruments carry fixed rates of interest. The amount of short-term debt outstanding as of December 31,
2019 and June 30, 2019 was $3.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect
to our short-term bank loans. Although the interest rates, which are based on the banks’ prime rates with respect to our
short-term loans, are fixed for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically three to twelve months for short-term bank loans
and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal. There was no material change in interest rates for short-term bank loans
renewed during the six months ended December 31, 2019. The original loan term on average is one year, and the remaining average
life of the short term-loans is approximately six months.
 

37
 

 
Management
monitors the banks’ prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances
relative to other sources of funds. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest
rate risk.
 
Credit
Risk
 
We
have not experienced significant credit risk, as most of our customers are long-term customers with superior payment records.
Our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers.
 
Inflation
Risk
 
Inflationary
factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high
rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with
these increased costs.

(a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
  
Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), at the conclusion of the period ended
