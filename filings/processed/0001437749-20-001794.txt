Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements



 
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary to present fairly the financial position of Seneca Foods Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 results of its operations and its cash flows for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The March 31, 2019 balance sheet was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements.
 
The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 28, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

During the nine months ended December 28, 2019, the Company sold on a gross basis including casing and labeling and future warehousing $116,515,000 of Green Giant finished goods inventory to B&G Foods, Inc. for cash, on a bill and hold basis, as compared to $65,741,000 for the nine months ended December 29, 2018. Under the terms of the bill and hold agreement, title to the specified inventory transferred to B&G. Under the new revenue recognition standard, this contract qualifies for bill and hold accounting treatment as the Company has concluded that control of the unlabeled products transfers to the customer at the time title transfers and the Company has the right to payment (prior to physical delivery), which results in earlier revenue recognition. Labeling and storage services that are provided after control of the goods has transferred to the customer are accounted for as separate performance obligations for which revenue is deferred until the services are performed.
 
The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 1 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Other footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
All references to years are fiscal years ended or ending March 31 unless otherwise indicated. Certain percentage tables may not foot due to rounding.
 
Reclassifications—Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification.

Discontinued Operations



 
On July 13, 2018, the Company executed a nonbinding letter of intent with a perspective buyer of the Modesto facility. On October 9, 2018, the Company closed on the sale of the facility to this outside buyer with net proceeds of $63,326,000. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company ceased use of the Modesto facility. Based on its magnitude of revenue to the Company (approximately 15%) and because the Company was exiting the production of peaches, this sale represented a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the Company has applied discontinued operations treatment for this sale as required by Accounting Standards Codification 210-05—Discontinued Operations. This business we are exiting is part of the Fruit and Vegetable segment.

Inventories



 
First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) based inventory costs exceeded LIFO based inventory costs by $153,884,000 as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $160,727,000 as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The change in the LIFO Reserve for the three months ended December 28, 2019 was a decrease of $11,337,000 as compared to an increase of $25,776,000 for the three months ended December 29, 2018.
 
The change in the LIFO Reserve for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 was a decrease of $7,457,000 as compared to an increase of $15,722,000 for the nine months ended December 29, 2018. The prior year-to-date decrease includes a decrease of $24,211,000 related to the LIFO impact of gain on sale of Modesto Fruit which is included in Other Operating Income under Discontinued Operations. The $15,722,000 also includes an increase of $39,933,000 related to Continuing Operations included in Cost of Product Sold. This reflects the projected impact of the disposal of Modesto Fruit partially offset by an overall cost increase expected in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019.

Leases



 
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the agreement. Operating leases are included in right-of-use operating assets, and current and noncurrent operating lease obligations in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. If the lease does not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use operating lease assets also include in its calculation any prepaid lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives received from the arrangement. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, and the impact of these options are included in the lease liability and lease asset calculations when the exercise of the option is at the Company’s sole discretion and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company will not separate lease and nonlease components for its leases when it is impractical to separate the two, such as leases with variable payment arrangements. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.
 
The Company has operating leases for land, machinery and equipment. The Company also has finance leases for machinery and equipment. The commencement date used for the calculation of the lease obligation is the latter of the commencement date of the new standard (April 1, 2019) or the lease start date. Certain of the leases have options to extend the life of the lease, which are included in the liability calculation when the option is at the sole discretion of the Company and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. In addition, the Company has certain leases that have variable payments based solely on output or usage of the leased asset. These variable operating lease assets are excluded from the Company’s balance sheet presentation and expensed as incurred. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not material. The Company currently has finance leases which were accounted for as capital leases under the previous standard and were unchanged as a result of this standard implementation.
 
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company determined its right-of-use assets related to the operating leases for its plant equipment in Sunnyside, Washington were partially impaired and therefore were reduced with a corresponding charge to retained earnings of $2,019,000 (which is net of tax). The estimated lives of these assets will be shortened due to the planned closure of the facility after the year’s pack.

Revolving Credit Facility



 
The Company has a five-year revolving credit facility (“Revolver”) with maximum borrowings totaling $400,000,000 from April through July and $500,000,000 from August through March and the Revolver matures on July 5, 2021. The Revolver balance as of December 28, 2019 was $114,689,000 and is included in Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company utilizes its Revolver for general corporate purposes, including seasonal working capital needs, to pay debt principal and interest obligations, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Seasonal working capital needs are affected by the growing cycles of the vegetables and fruits the Company processes. The majority of vegetable and fruit inventories are produced during the months of June through November and are then sold over the following year. Payment terms for vegetable and fruit produce are generally three months but can vary from a few days to seven months. Accordingly, the Company’s need to draw on the Revolver may fluctuate significantly throughout the year.

The decrease in the reported average outstanding Revolver borrowings during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was attributable to the sale of various Company facilities during the period.
 
General terms of the Revolver include payment of interest at LIBOR plus a defined spread.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards



 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements – Leases (Topic 842)." This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption, versus recasting the prior periods presented. If elected, an entity would recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted ASU 2016-02 as of April 1, 2019, using the optional transition method provided by ASU 2018-11.  The standard resulted in the initial recognition of $88,333,000 of total operating lease assets and $91,025,000 of net operating lease liabilities and a net adjustment to retained earnings totaling $2,019,000 ($2,692,000 less tax effect of $673,000) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on April 1, 2019. The standard did not materially impact the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. At adoption, the Company recorded an adjustment to retained earnings of $2,019,000, which includes an impairment loss that was related to a Northwest plant impairment which was incurred in March 2019 just prior to adoption of this standard. The disclosures required by the recently adopted accounting standard are included in Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-14 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
 
There were no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that impacted the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company did not adopt any other new accounting pronouncements during the quarter ended December 28, 2019.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments



 
As required by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 825, “Financial Instruments,” the Company estimates the fair values of financial instruments on a quarterly basis. The estimated fair value for long-term debt (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) is determined by the quoted market prices for similar debt (comparable to the Company’s financial strength) or current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same maturities. Long-term debt, including current portion had a carrying amount of $225,337,000 and an estimated fair value of $225,287,000 as of December 28, 2019. Long-term debt, including current portion had a carrying amount of $325,373,000 and an estimated fair value of $325,276,000 as of December 29, 2018. As of March 31, 2019, the carrying amount was $266,245,000 and the estimated fair value was $266,140,000. The fair values of all the other financial instruments approximate their carrying value due to their short-term nature.

 
 




14.


Income Taxes



 
The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 23.7% and 25.7% for the nine month periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. The 2.0 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to federal income tax credits and incentives.  The dollar amount of the federal credits and incentives did not change significantly from 2019 to 2020. The decrease is the result of having a pre-tax loss in 2018 and pre-tax income in 2019. The 2018 federal credits and incentives created a tax benefit which increased the tax rate because of the pre-tax loss.  The 2019 federal credits and incentives also created a tax benefit.  However, in 2019 the tax benefit decreased the tax rate because of the pre-tax income.

For the three month period ended December 28, 2019, the gross margin increased from the prior year quarter from (0.6)% to 13.3% due primarily to a lower LIFO charge in the third quarter of 2020. The LIFO credit for continuing operations for the third quarter ended December 28, 2019 was $11,337,000 or 2.9% of sales as compared to a charge of $25,776,000 or 6.9% of sales for the third quarter ended December 29, 2018 and reflects the impact on the quarter of lower cost increases and lower yields for certain commodities in fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019. On an after-tax basis, LIFO net earnings increased by $8,503,000 for the quarter ended December 28, 2019 and LIFO net earnings decreased by $19,332,000 for the quarter ended December 29, 2018, based on the historical statutory federal income tax rate.
 
For the nine month period ended December 28, 2019, the gross margin increased from the prior year period from 2.7% to 9.3% due primarily to a lower LIFO charge in the current year. The LIFO credit for the first nine months ended December 28, 2019 was $7,457,000 or 0.7% of sales as compared to a charge of $39,933,000 or 4.3% of sales for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and reflects the impact on the nine months of lower cost increases and lower yields for certain commodities in fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019. On an after-tax basis, LIFO net earnings increased by $5,593,000 for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and LIFO net earnings decreased by $29,950,000 for the nine months ended December 29, 2018, based on the historical statutory federal income tax rate.

For the three month period ended December 28, 2019, selling costs as a percentage of sales decreased from 2.6% to 2.4%. For the nine month period ended December 28, 2019, selling costs as a percentage of sales decreased from 2.8% to 2.5%.
 
For the three month period ended December 28, 2019, administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased from 2.6% to 2.7%. For the nine month period ended December 28, 2019, administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased from 3.1% to 2.8%. This is primarily due to higher sales during the nine month period compared to same period in the prior year and the fixed nature of these administrative costs.
 
During the nine months ended December 28, 2019 the Company recorded a gain on the partial sale of a plant in the Midwest of $3,742,000 and a gain on the partial sale of a plant in the Northwest of $1,737,000. The Company also recorded a gain of on the sale of unused fixed assets of $3,139,000. During the nine months ended December 29, 2018, the Company sold unused fixed assets which resulted in a gain of $3,920,000 mostly related to the sale of a closed plant in the Midwest. These items are included in other operating income (loss) in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Earnings.
 
Interest expense for the third quarter ended December 28, 2019, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 0.7% from 1.0% in third quarter ended December 29, 2018. Interest expense for the nine months ended December 28, 2019, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 0.9% from 1.2% in nine months ended December 29, 2018. During fiscal 2020, overall borrowings and interest rates were lower than the previous year.
 
Income Taxes:
 
The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 23.7% and 25.7% for the nine month periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. The 2.0 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to federal income tax credits and incentives.  The dollar amount of the federal credits and incentives did not change significantly from 2019 to 2020. The decrease is the result of having a pre-tax loss in 2018 and pre-tax income in 2019. The 2018 federal credits and incentives created a tax benefit which increased the tax rate because of the pre-tax loss.  The 2019 federal credits and incentives also created a tax benefit.  However, in 2019 the tax benefit decreased the tax rate because of the pre-tax income.
 
Earnings (Loss) per Share:
 
Continuing basic earnings (loss) per share were $2.65 and $(2.07) for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Continuing diluted earnings (loss) per share were $2.63 and $(2.07) for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Continuing basic earnings (loss) per share were $3.23 and $(2.86) for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Continuing diluted earnings (loss) per share were $3.20 and $(2.86) for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. For details of the calculation of these amounts, refer to footnote 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
 
The financial condition of the Company is summarized in the following table and explanatory review:
 

 
Note: Equivalent common shares are either common shares or, for convertible preferred shares, the number of common shares that the preferred shares are convertible into. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for conversion details.
 
As shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $115,320,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to $46,430,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The $68,890,000 increase in cash provided is primarily attributable to the following items: an increase in cash provided by net earnings from continuing operations of $58,000,000, a $37,097,000 increase in cash provided by accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $7,043,000 increase in cash provided by income taxes, a $5,156,000 increase in cash provided by other current assets, and a $2,999,000 increase in cash provided by account receivable.  These increases were offset by a $44,217,000 decrease in cash provided by inventory.
 
As compared to December 29, 2018, inventory decreased $82,870,000 to $493,065,000 at December 28, 2019. The components of the inventory decrease (excluding LIFO) reflect a $92,346,000 decrease in finished goods, a $6,415,000 decrease in work in process and a $9,048,000 increase in raw materials and supplies. The finished goods increase reflects lower inventory quantities attributable to the lower calendar year 2019 pack versus the calendar year 2018 pack. The raw materials and supplies increase is primarily due to an increase in cans and raw steel quantities compared to the prior year. FIFO based inventory costs exceeded LIFO based inventory costs by $153,884,000 as of the end of the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $160,727,000 as of the end of the third quarter of 2019.
 
Cash used in investing activities was $25,506,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to cash provided in investing activities of $54,507,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $47,681,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to $30,468,000 in first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Company received cash proceeds from the sale of various assets which totaled $22,175,000 during the nine months ended December 28, 2019. The Company received cash proceeds from the sale of various assets from divested plants which totaled $84,975,000 during the nine months ended December 29, 2018. 
 
Cash used in financing activities was $87,436,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, which included borrowings of $401,053,000 and the repayment of $465,099,000 of long-term debt, principally consisting of borrowings and repayments on the revolving credit facility (“Revolver”). The Company made additional repayments on the Revolver from cash proceeds received from the sale of various assets.  Other than borrowings under the Revolver, there was no new long-term debt during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 The Company repurchased $11,454,000 and $5,340,000 of stock during the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility on July 5, 2016. Available borrowings on the Revolver total $400,000,000 from April through July and $500,000,000 from August through March with a maturity date of July 5, 2021.  The interest rate on the Revolver is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on excess availability and the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 28, 2019, the interest rate was approximately 3.27% on a balance of $114,689,000. We believe that cash flows from operations, availability under our Revolver and other financing sources will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months.
 
The Company’s credit facilities contain standard representations and warranties, events of default, and certain affirmative and negative covenants, including various financial covenants.
 
New Accounting Standards
 
Refer to footnote 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company's revenues are typically higher in the second and third quarters. This is due in part because the Company sells, on a bill and hold basis, Green Giant canned and frozen vegetables to B&G either weekly during production for specialty items, or at the end of each pack cycle, which typically occurs during these quarters. B&G buys the product from the Company at cost plus a specified fee for each equivalent case. See the Critical Accounting Policies section below for further details. The Company’s non-Green Giant sales also exhibit seasonality with the third fiscal quarter generating the highest retail sales due to holidays that occur during that quarter.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
During the nine months ended December 28, 2019, the Company sold $116,515,000 of Green Giant finished goods inventory to B&G Foods North America (“B&G”) for cash, on a bill and hold basis, as compared to $65,741,000 for the nine months ended December 29, 2018. Under the terms of the bill and hold agreement, title to the specified inventory transferred to B&G. Under the new revenue recognition standard, this contract qualifies for bill and hold accounting treatment as the Company has concluded that control of the unlabeled products transfers to the customer at the time title transfers and the Company has the right to payment (prior to physical delivery), which results in earlier revenue recognition. Labeling and storage services that are provided after control of the goods has transferred to the customer are accounted for as separate performance obligations for which revenue is deferred until the services are performed.
 
Trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the Company’s branded products, and are critical to the support of the business. Trade promotion costs, which are recorded as a reduction of net sales, include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of our products to consumers, amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers’ stores, and amounts paid to retailers for shelf space in retail stores. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the retailer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a retailer from amounts otherwise due to us. As a result, the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by retailers for amounts they consider due to them. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time.
 
The Company uses the lower of cost, determined under the LIFO (last-in, first out) method, or market, to value substantially all of its inventories. In a high inflation environment that the Company was experiencing, the Company believes that the LIFO method was preferable over the FIFO method because it better compares the cost of current production to current revenue.
 
The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is an indicator of impairment. Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated over their assigned lives. The assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective. If actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated, a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal of the assets could be incurred. Impairment losses are evaluated if the estimated undiscounted value of the cash flows is less than the carrying value. If such is the case, a loss is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.

ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risk factors, including changes in general economic conditions, competition and raw material pricing and availability. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, primarily related to its revolving credit facility and the $100,000,000 term loan. To manage interest rate risk, the Company uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt plus fixed interest rate capital lease obligations. There have been no material changes to the Company’s exposure to market risk since March 31, 2019.

ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures
 
The Company maintains a system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.
