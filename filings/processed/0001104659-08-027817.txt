Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis of Presentation: 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto
are unaudited.  In the opinion
of the management of International Business Machines Corporation (the company),
these statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring
nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and gains and losses
not affecting retained earnings that are reported in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying disclosures. 
Actual results may be different. 
See the companys 2007 Annual Report for a discussion of the companys
critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year.  The information
included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys
2007 Annual Report.
 
Within
the financial tables in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not
add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages
presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
 
2. Accounting Changes:  In
March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 expands the current disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, such that entities must now provide
enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses
derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under
SFAS No. 133 and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the
entitys financial position, performance and cash flow. Pursuant to the
transition provisions of the Statement, the company will adopt SFAS No. 161
in fiscal year 2009 and will present the required disclosures in the prescribed
format on a prospective basis. This Statement will not impact the Consolidated
Financial Statements as it is disclosure-only in nature.
 
In February 2008,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial Accounting Standard (FAS)
157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13
and Its Related Interpretive Accounting Pronouncements That Address Leasing
Transactions, and FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157.
FSP FAS 157-1 removes leasing from the scope of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements. FSP FAS 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157
from 2008 to 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities,
except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). See SFAS No. 157
discussion on page 7.
 
In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which will
become effective in 2009 via prospective application to new business combinations.
This Statement requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to
a broader set of business combinations, amends the definition of a business
combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an acquirer to
recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date and
requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be
measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date (with
limited exceptions). The company will adopt this Statement in fiscal year 2009
and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of
any acquisitions subject to this statement.
 
In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement
requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be
accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the
treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest
and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional
disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the
controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 160, the company will adopt the Statement in fiscal year 2009 via
retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure requirements. The
company does not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material
effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
The Fair  Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,
which became effective January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities
to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally
accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is
irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
recorded in earnings. The company adopted this
Statement as of January 1, 2008 and the adoption of this Statement did not
have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In September 2006, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 157
which became effective January 1, 2008 except as amended by FSP FAS 157-1
and FSP FAS 157-2 as previously described. This Statement defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements; however, it does not require any new fair value
measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 were applied prospectively to
fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets and financial
liabilities and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis
beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of this Statement did not
have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value
measurements made during the first quarter of 2008. While the company does not
expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on its
Consolidated Financial Statements in subsequent reporting periods, the company
continues to monitor any additional implementation guidance that is issued that
addresses the fair value measurements for certain financial assets, such as
private market pension plan assets, and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities not disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least
an annual basis. See Note 6 on pages 9 and 10 for additional information
regarding the adoption of this Statement.

Equity:  The following

4.  Stock-Based
Compensation:  Stock-based
compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award,
and is recognized over the employee requisite service period. The following
table presents total stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings:

The
reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2008, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior
year, was principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants
($65 million) offset by an increase related to restricted and performance-based
stock units ($57 million).
 
7





 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
As
of March 31, 2008, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,029
million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately three years.
 
There
was no significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31,
2008 and 2007.
 
For
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awarded after December 31, 2007, dividend
equivalents will not be paid. The fair value of such RSUs is determined and
fixed on the grant date based on the companys stock price adjusted for the
exclusion of dividend equivalents.
 
5. Retirement-Related
Benefits:  The company
offers defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, as

The company received a $3.1 million subsidy in the
first quarter of 2008 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by
the company to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the
remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the
participants.  For further information
related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 115 in the companys
2007 Annual Report.
 
6. Fair Value:  As highlighted in Note 2 on  page 6, the company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157-1 and FSP FAS 157-2
on January 1, 2008. Pursuant to the provisions of FSP FAS 157-2, the
company will not apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157 until January 1,
2009 for the following major categories of nonfinancial assets and liabilities
from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: Plant, rental machines
and other property-net; Goodwill; Intangible assets-net and the Asset
retirement obligation liabilities within Other accrued expenses and liabilities
and Other liabilities.  The company
recorded no change to its opening balance of Retained earnings as of January 1,
2008 as it did not have any financial instruments requiring retrospective
application per the provisions of SFAS No. 157.
 
Fair Value Hierarchy
 
SFAS No. 157 specifies a hierarchy of valuation
techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect
assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained
from independent sources (observable inputs) or reflect the companys own
assumptions of market participant valuation (unobservable inputs). In accordance
with SFAS No. 157, these two types of inputs have created the following
fair value hierarchy:
 
· Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets that are
unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities;
 
· Level 2  Quoted prices for identical assets and
liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which
significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;
 
·
Level 3   Prices or valuations that
require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable.
 
SFAS No. 157 requires the use of observable
market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort.
 
Measurement of Fair Value
 
The company measures fair value as an exit price using
the procedures described below for all assets and liabilities measured at fair
value. When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to
measure fair value and classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models
that use, where possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market
parameters such as interest rates and  
currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are
classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is
significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even
though there may be inputs that are readily observable. If quoted market prices
are not available, the valuation model used generally depends on the specific
 
9





 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
asset or liability being valued. The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and marketable
debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using
discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument. In the event
of an other-than-temporary impairment of a nonpublic equity method investment,
the company uses the net asset value of its investment in the investee adjusted
using discounted cash flows for the companys estimate of the price that it
would receive to sell the investment to a market participant that would
consider all factors that would impact the investments fair value. In
determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers base
valuations calculated using the methodologies described  below for several parameters that market
participants would consider in determining fair value.
 
· Counterparty credit risk adjustments are
applied to financial instruments, where the base valuation uses market
parameters based on an AA (or equivalent) credit rating. Due to the fact that
not all counterparties have a AA (or equivalent) credit rating, it is necessary
to take into account the actual credit rating of a counterparty to determine
the true fair value of such an instrument.
 
· Credit risk adjustments are applied to
reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at
fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing
counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit
risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Recurring Basis
 
The following table presents the companys assets and
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31,
2008 consistent with the fair value hierarchy provisions of SFAS No. 157.

At March 31, 2008, the company did not have any
assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
 
Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Nonrecurring Basis
 
Certain assets are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the table above. These
assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair value at
the end of the period to the extent that they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily
impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
and are included in the table above can also be subject to nonrecurring fair
value measurements. These assets include public cost method investments that
are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The company did not record
any other-than-temporary impairment charges for these assets during the first
quarter of 2008.

7. Accelerated Share Repurchase:  In May 2007,
IBM International Group (IIG), a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the company
repurchased 118.8 million shares of common stock for $12.5 billion under
accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with three banks.
 
Pursuant
to the ASR agreements, executed on May 25, 2007, IIG paid an initial
purchase price of $105.18 per share for the repurchase. The initial purchase
price was subject to adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of
IBM common stock over a settlement period of three months for each of the
banks. The adjustment also reflected certain other amounts including the banks
carrying costs, compensation for ordinary dividends declared by the company
during the settlement period and interest benefits for receiving the $12.5
billion payment in advance of the anticipated purchases by each bank of shares
in the open market during its settlement period.  The adjustment amount could be settled in
cash, registered shares or unregistered shares at IIGs option. Under the ASR, IIG
had a separate settlement with each of the three banks. The first settlement
occurred on September 6, 2007, resulting in a settlement payment to the
bank of $151.8 million. The second settlement occurred on December 5,
2007, resulting in a settlement payment to the bank of $253.1 million. The
third settlement occurred on March 4, 2008, resulting in a settlement
payment to the company of $54.2 million. The settlement amounts were paid in
cash at the election of IIG in accordance with the provisions of the ASR and
were recorded as adjustments to Stockholders equity in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position on the settlement dates. The adjusted average
price paid per share during the ASR period was $108.13, resulting in a total
purchase price of $12,851 million versus the original $12,500 million. The $351
million difference was settled in cash.
 
8. Acquisitions:  During the three months ended March 31, 2008, the
company completed seven acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $5,198 million.
The Cognos, Inc. acquisition is shown separately given the significant
purchase price.
 
Cognos, Inc.
 On January 31, 2008 the company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding
common shares of Cognos, Inc. for consideration of  $5,021 million consisting of $4,998 million
of cash and $24 million of equity instruments. Through this acquisition, IBM
and Cognos will become a leading provider of technology and services for
business intelligence and performance management, delivering the industrys
most complete, open standards-based platform with the broadest range of
expertise to help companies expand the value of their information, optimize
their business processes and maximize performance across their enterprises. The
company acquired Cognos to accelerate its Information on Demand strategy, a
cross-company initiative that combines the companys strength in information
integration, content and data management and business consulting services to
unlock the business value of information. Cognos was integrated into the
Software segment upon acquisition and goodwill, as reflected in the table on page 12
has been entirely assigned to the Software segment. It is expected that 40-50
percent of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. The overall
weighted average useful life of the intangible assets purchased, excluding
goodwill, is 6.5 years.
 
Other
Acquisitions -  The company acquired six
additional companies at an aggregate cost of $178 million that are presented in
the table on page 12 as Other Acquisitions.
 
The
Software segment completed four other acquisitions: AptSoft Corporation, Solid
Information Technology,  Net Integration
Technologies Inc. and Encentuate, Inc., all  privately held companies. Each acquisition
further complemented and enhanced the software product portfolio.
 
Global
Technology Services (GTS) completed one acquisition: Arsenal Digital Solutions,
a privately held company. Arsenal provides global clients with security rich
information protection services designed to handle increasing data retention
requirements.
 
Global Business Services (GBS) completed one
acquisition: u9consult, a privately held company. u9consult complements the companys existing capabilities
in value chain consulting.
 
Purchase
price consideration for the Other Acquisitions was paid all in cash. All
acquisitions are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of
acquired cash and cash equivalents.

The
acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions, and accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. For the Other Acquisitions, the
overall weighted-average life of the identified amortizable intangible assets
acquired is 3.4 years. With the exception of goodwill, these identified
intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
lives. Goodwill of $143 million has been assigned to the Software ($60 million)
and Global Technology Services ($83 million) segments. None of the goodwill
related to Other Acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.
 
9. Printing
Systems Divestiture:  In January 2007, the
company announced an agreement with Ricoh Company Limited (Ricoh), a publicly
traded company, to form a joint venture company based on IBMs Printing System
Division (a division of the Systems and Technology segment). The company
initially created a wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoPrint Solutions Company, LLC
(InfoPrint), by contributing specific assets and liabilities from its printer
business. The companys Printing System Division generated approximately $1
billion of revenue in 2006. The InfoPrint portfolio includes solutions for
production printing for enterprises and commercial printers as well as
solutions for office workgroup environments and industrial segments. On June 1,
2007 (closing date), the company divested 51 percent of its interest in
InfoPrint to Ricoh.  The company will
divest its remaining 49 percent ownership to Ricoh quarterly over the next
three years from the closing date. At March 31, 2008, the companys
ownership in InfoPrint was 36.7 percent. See IBMs 2007 Annual Report, Note C, Acquisitions/Divestitures,
for additional information.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
Net investment in sales-type leases is for leases that
relate principally to the companys equipment and are for terms ranging from
two to seven years. Net investment in sales-type leases includes unguaranteed
residual values of $931 million and $915 million at March 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of $1,072 million
and $1,016 million and of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $135 million
and $127 million at those dates, respectively.
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to
inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM
and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable
financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables relate to loans that are
provided by Global Financing primarily to the companys clients to finance the
purchase of the companys software and services. Separate contractual
relationships on these financing arrangements are for terms ranging from two to
seven years. Each financing contract is priced independently at competitive
market rates. The company has a history of enforcing the terms of these
separate financing agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing
receivables as collateral for non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables
pledged as collateral for borrowings were $297 million and $258 million at March 31,
2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
 
The company did not have any financing receivables
held for sale as of March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.

The
net carrying amount of intangible assets increased $1,015 million during the
first quarter of 2008, primarily due to acquired intangible assets and
capitalized software additions, partially offset by amortization. The aggregate
intangible amortization expense was $317 million and $291 million for the
quarters ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, in the
first quarter, the company retired $338 million of fully amortized intangible
assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization
by this amount.

There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the quarter.
 
12. Segments:  The table
on page 48 of this Form 10-Q reflects the results of the companys
reportable segments consistent with the management system used by the companys
chief operating decision maker. These results are not necessarily a depiction
that is in conformity with GAAP. For example, employee retirement plan costs
are developed using actuarial assumptions on a country-by-country basis and
allocated to the segments based on headcount. 
Different results could occur if actuarial assumptions that are unique
to the segments were used. Performance measurement is based on income before
income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in part, by management,
both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of
the segments.

14. Contingencies:  The company is involved in a variety of
claims, demands, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from time to
time in the ordinary course of its business, including actions with respect to
contracts, intellectual property (IP), product liability, employment, benefits,
securities, foreign operations and environmental matters. These actions may be
commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, partners,
clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies,
stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does
business.
 
The following is a summary of some of the more significant legal
matters involving the company.
 
The company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in
state court in Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company
removed the case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in
interest to some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright
infringement, unfair competition, interference with contract and breach of
contract with regard to the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and
contribution of code to Linux. The company has asserted counterclaims,
including breach of contract, violation of the Lanham Act, unfair competition,
intentional torts, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of the General
Public License that governs open source distributions, promissory estoppel and
copyright infringement. In October 2005, the company withdrew its patent
counterclaims in an effort to simplify and focus the issues in the case and to
expedite their resolution. Motions for summary judgment were heard in March 2007,
and the court has not yet issued its decision. On August 10, 2007, the
court in another suit, The SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., issued a
decision and order determining, among other things, that Novell is the owner of
UNIX and UnixWare copyrights, and obligating SCO to recognize Novells waiver
of SCOs claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license agreements.
At the request of the court in SCO v. IBM, on August 31, 2007, each of the
parties filed a status report with the court concerning the effect of the August 10th
Novell ruling on the SCO v. IBM case, including the pending motions. On September 14,
2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this
case were stayed.
 
On November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform
Solutions, Inc. (PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. IBM filed its amended complaint on August 17, 2007
and asserted claims for patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation,
copyright infringement, tortious interference and breach of contract in
connection with PSIs development and marketing of a computer system that PSI
says is compatible with IBMs S/390 and System z architectures. IBM also sought
a declaratory judgment that its refusal to license its patents to PSI and
certain of its software for use on PSI systems does not violate the antitrust
laws. IBM seeks damages and injunctive relief. On September 21, 2007, PSI
answered the amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against IBM for
alleged monopolization and attempted monopolization, tying, violations of New
York and California statutes proscribing unfair competition, tortious
interference with the acquisition of PSI by a third party and promissory
estoppel. PSI also sought declaratory judgments of noninfringement of IBMs
patents and patent invalidity. In October 2007, PSI filed a complaint with
the European Commission claiming that the companys alleged refusal to do
business with PSI violated European competition law. The company responded to
this complaint in December. On January 11, 2008, the court in the New York
lawsuit permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems, to
intervene as a counterclaim-plaintiff, and the court also permitted the company
to file a second amended complaint adding patent infringement claims against
T3. Discovery is proceeding and the court has 
tentatively set the case for trial on March 16, 2009.
 
In October 2003, a purported collective action lawsuit was filed
against IBM in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California by 10 former IBM employees alleging, on behalf of themselves and
allegedly similarly situated former employees, that the company engaged in a
pattern and practice of discriminating against employees on the basis of age
when it terminated employees, both in connection with reductions in force and
individualized determinations (Syverson v. IBM). Initially, the District Court
dismissed the lawsuit on the basis of release agreements signed by all the
plaintiffs. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial courts finding
that the release barred these claims, and in January 2007, after denial of
IBMs petition for rehearing, the matter was returned to the trial court for
further proceedings. On October 3, 2007, the court dismissed with
prejudice plaintiffs claim for relief under the Older Workers Benefit
Protection Act, and dismissed with leave to amend plaintiffs claim asserting
disparate impact age discrimination with respect to individualized
terminations. On November 6, 2007, plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint, amending the disparate impact claim. IBM filed its answer on November 26,
2007, and discovery is proceeding.
 
In July 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York related to the companys
disclosures concerning first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity
compensation. Pursuant to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006,
the two lawsuits were consolidated into a single action captioned In re
International Business Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. Plaintiffs filed
a corrected consolidated amended complaint dated May 19, 2006, in which
they named the company and IBMs Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer as
 
15

defendants and alleged that defendants made certain misrepresentations
and omissions in violation of Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
On September 20, 2006, the Court denied a Motion to Dismiss that was filed
by IBM. On March 12, 2007, the plaintiffs class was certified; class
notifications were mailed on or about May 30, 2007.
 
In January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South
Korea announced it had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several
companies, including IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea
and LG Electronics, which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005)
and had also charged employees of some of those entities with, among other
things, bribery of certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea
and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in
these matters. A number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM
employees, were subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM
were also required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different
times, covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance,
which barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter. In March 2008,
the company received a request from the SEC for additional information.
 
On March 27, 2008, the company was temporarily suspended from
participating in new business with U.S. Federal government agencies.  The notice of temporary suspension was issued
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related to an investigation by
the EPA of possible violations of the Procurement Integrity provisions of the
Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act regarding a specific bid for business
with the EPA originally submitted in March 2006. In addition, the U.S.
Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia served the company and
certain employees with grand jury subpoenas related to the bid, requesting
testimony and documents regarding interactions between employees of the EPA and
certain company employees. On April 4, 2008, the company announced an agreement
with the EPA that terminated the temporary suspension order.  The company is cooperating with the EPA and
with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.
 
The company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought in Tokyo District
Court by Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover losses that it
allegedly suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil rehabilitation
(bankruptcy) proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo Leasing
amounts for which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others liable. The
claims in this suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1,
2008 in Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege causes of action for negligence
and recklessness, private nuisance, and trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases
seek medical monitoring and claim damages in unspecified amounts for a variety
of personal injuries and property damages allegedly arising out of the presence
of groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants
into certain structures in which plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted
business, allegedly resulting from the release of chemicals into the
environment by the company at its former manufacturing and development facility
in Endicott. These complaints also seek punitive damages in an unspecified
amount.
 
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought
by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund,
or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible
parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or
ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental
investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several
current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative
orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and
is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former
operating sites.
 
The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and
governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S.
companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various
challenges with Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and
non-income tax litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims
for taxes on the importation of computer software. The total amounts related to
these matters are approximately $2.3 billion, including amounts currently in
litigation and other amounts. In addition, the company has received an income
tax assessment from Mexican authorities relating to the deductibility of
certain warranty payments. In response, the company has filed an appeal in the
Mexican Federal Fiscal court. The total potential amount related to this matter
for all applicable years is
 
16





 
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued)
 
approximately $500 million. The company believes it will prevail on
these matters and that these amounts are not meaningful indicators of
liability.
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,
(SFAS No. 5), the company records a provision with respect to a claim,
suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and
proceedings are reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or
adjusted to reflect the impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of
counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded
liabilities including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended March 31,
2008, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its
experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters
previously referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential
liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters
previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend itself
vigorously in all such matters, it is possible that the companys business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in
any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
Whether any losses, damages or remedies
finally determined in any such claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could
reasonably have a material effect on the companys business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of
variables, including the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the
structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any
such losses, damages or remedies may have on the Consolidated Financial Statements;
and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter which may give
rise to additional factors.
 
15. Commitments:  The
companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused
amounts of $4,268 million and $3,702 million at March 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $3,717 million and $3,654
million at March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
 
The
company has applied the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, to its
agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses. These disclosure
provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5, by
requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the
likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following is
a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
 
The
company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be
obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters.
Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by
the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants
related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual
property (IP) rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance
of non-financial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of
these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party
making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract,
which procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other partys
claims. Further, the companys obligations under these agreements may be
limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It
is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these or similar agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements
have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition
or results of operations.
 
In
addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The
maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $24
million and $23 million at March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position is not material.

The
decrease in the balance was primarily driven by a reduction in estimated future
cost as a result of the divestiture of the companys Personal Computing
business to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) in April 2005.
 
16. Subsequent Events: 
On April 29, 2008, the company announced that the Board
of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share. The
dividend is payable June 10, 2008 to shareholders of record on May 9,
2008. The dividend declaration represents an increase of $0.10, or 25 percent
more than the prior quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share.
 
On April 29, 2008, the IBM Board of Directors
approved a pension adjustment for certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries.
Effective September 1, 2008, this adjustment provides a pension increase
to approximately 42,000 IBM retirees who retired before January 1,1997.
The impact of this adjustment will be included in the Personal Pension Plan
remeasurement at December 31, 2008, therefore, there will be no impact to
2008 net periodic pension cost.
 
On
April 3, 2008, the company announced the completion of the acquisition of
Telelogic AB for approximately $845 million in cash.

*  The following Results of Continuing Operations discussion
does not include the hard disk drive (HDD) business that the company sold to
Hitachi, Ltd. on December 31, 2002. The HDD business was accounted for as
a discontinued operation under generally accepted accounting principles. There
were no losses for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2007.
 
** 3.9 percent adjusted for
currency
 
Within the
Management Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at
constant currency are made so that the financial results and other performance
metrics can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the
companys business performance.
 
Total
revenue increased 11.2 percent as reported, 4 percent adjusted for currency,
versus the first quarter of 2007. Pre-tax income from continuing operations was
$3,197 million, up 24.0 percent versus the first quarter of 2007. Diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.65 versus $1.21, a 36.4
percent improvement year-to-year.
 
The company delivered strong financial results in the first quarter by
capitalizing on its ability to deliver specific value propositions and
solutions to its clients worldwide. Growth remained strong in the emerging
growth markets, as the company continues its focus on building out the IT
infrastructures in these countries. The companys performance in the period
benefited from its balanced and stable operating model  a significant annuity
business which drives about half of the companys revenue and reduces its dependency on
high-volume transactions; a continued focus on cost and expense management
which has resulted in gross margin expansion in 14 of the last 15 quarters;
and, a disciplined approach to aligning investments to growth opportunities.
 
The
increase in revenue was driven by strong double digit growth in the Global
Services segments. Global Technology Services revenue increased 17.2 percent,
while Global Business Services revenue improved by 17.4 percent versus the
first quarter of 2007.  Software segment
revenue increased 14.0 percent led by branded middleware. The acquisition of
Cognos contributed approximately 1 point to the companys revenue growth in the
quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue from Systems
and Technology of 6.7 percent primarily driven by weaker performance in Microelectronics
OEM and System x, partially offset by the successful launch of the new z10
mainframe and revenue growth in Storage and System p midrange servers. Global
Financing revenue increased 3.0 percent reflecting an improvement in financing
revenue offset by a decline in used equipment sales.
 
19





 
The
gross profit margin was 41.5 percent, an increase of 1.2 points, primarily due
to improved margins in Global Technology Services (0.6 points of the increase)
and improved margins and revenue mix in Systems and Technology (0.6 points of
the increase).
 
Total
expense and other income increased 10.8 percent (5 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. Overall,
the increase was driven by approximately 6 points due to the effects of
currency, 4 points due to acquisitions and 2 points from additional interest
expense associated with the 2007 accelerated share repurchase with other
operational expenses down slightly versus the prior year.
 
The
companys effective tax rate for the first three months of 2008 was 27.5
percent versus 28.5 percent in the first three months of 2007.
 
Total assets increased $1,392 million (decreased $1,450 million
adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2007, primarily due to increased
goodwill ($4,339 million) and intangible assets ($1,015 million) due to the
Cognos acquisition, increased prepaid pension assets ($1,043 million) and
prepaid expenses ($565 million), partially offset by lower cash and cash
equivalents ($4,205 million), also due to the Cognos acquisition, and lower
financing receivables ($1,690 million). The company had $12,027 million in cash
and marketable securities at March 31, 2008.
 
Total liabilities increased $1,134 million (decreased $1,305 million
adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2007, primarily due to deferred
income ($1,451 million), retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit
obligations ($680 million), and other accruals ($829 million), partially offset
by lower compensation and benefits ($826 million), accounts payable ($725
million) and taxes ($640 million).
 
Stockholders equity of $28,728 million increased $258 million from December 31,
2007, primarily due to higher retained earnings ($1,737 million) and common
stock ($1,064 million), partially offset by increased treasury stock  ($2,675 million).
 
The company generated $4,202 million in cash flow provided by operating
activities, an increase of $1,186 million, compared to the first quarter of 2007,
primarily driven by increased net income ($475 million) and changes in
operating assets and liabilities ($408 million). Net cash used in investing
activities of $5,778 million was $3,360 million higher than the first quarter
of 2007, primarily due to the Cognos acquisition. Net cash used in financing
activities of $2,796 million was $1,079 million higher, primarily due to an
increase in net payments associated with debt ($2,012 million), partially
offset by lower payments to repurchase common stock ($970 million) in the first
quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007.
 
Global
Services signings were $12,611 million, an increase of 6 percent year to year
($10,830 million, down 2 percent, adjusted for currency). The estimated Global Services backlog, at
constant currency, ended at $118 billion, flat versus the December 31,
2007 balance and $2 billion higher compared to the March 31, 2007 balance.

The companys Global Services segments, Global
Technology Services and Global Business Services had combined revenue of
$14,588 million, an increase of 17.3 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007.  Performance was broad based with double-digit
growth in all lines of businesses and across all geographies, driven by the
strength of the annuity base and a portfolio of offerings that are driving cost
savings and value for clients. In the first-quarter 2008, total Global Services
signings increased 6 percent year to year to $12,611 million ($10,830 million
adjusted for currency, down 2 percent). Short-term signings were $6,465
million, an increase of 13 percent year to year (6 percent adjusted for currency).
Long-term signings were $6,146 million, flat year to year (decreased 10 percent
adjusted for currency). The Global Services segments delivered combined pre-tax
profit of $1,567 million, an improvement of 36.2 percent versus the first
quarter of 2007.
 
In
the first quarter, in addition to reporting Global Services signings at
constant currency, the company is presenting signings as reported, or at actual
rates. The company believes that presenting signings at actual rates may
provide investors with a better view of how these signings will convert to
services revenue, particularly for the shorter-term businesses within the
Global Services segments. In addition, reporting signings at actual rates will
provide better comparability to other companies in the industry who report
signings using actual rates.
 
Global
Technology Services (GTS) revenue increased 17.2 percent (9 percent adjusted
for currency) versus the first quarter of 2007. GTS delivered double-digit
revenue growth across all business lines and geographies. Total signings in GTS
increased 2 percent (decreased 7 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2008, with long-term signings decreasing 2 percent (12 percent
adjusted for currency) while short-term signings increased 11 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency).
 
Strategic
Outsourcing (SO) revenue was up 15.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first quarter of 2008 versus the same period in 2007. This is the
largest annuity component of the services business.  Revenue growth was driven by a strong
backlog, good prior year signings and continued base account growth. SO
signings in the first quarter of 2008 increased 1 percent (decreased 9 percent
adjusted for currency) when compared to the first quarter of 2007.
 
Integrated
Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 15.2 percent (7 percent adjusted
for currency) in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007.
Revenue growth was driven primarily by the key infrastructure offerings. ITS
signings in the first quarter increased 11 percent (4 percent adjusted for
currency) year to year.
 
Maintenance
revenue increased 18.9 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency) in the
quarter, driven primarily by maintenance services on non-IBM IT equipment.
Services provided to Ricoh InfoPrint Solutions, following the divestiture of
the printer business in the second quarter of 2007, contributed 7 points of
growth in the quarter.  These services
will transition to Ricoh in the second quarter of 2008.
 
Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue was up 33.6 percent (28 percent
adjusted for currency) year to year with double-digit growth in all geographies.
BTO signings, which can vary significantly period-to-period, declined 22
percent (27 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter.
 
Global
Business Services (GBS) revenue increased 17.4 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the prior year, with
double-digit growth in all geographies and all sectors. The Application
Management Services and Core Consulting businesses both had strong revenue
performance in the quarter.  All
consulting services lines, which include Financial Management Services, Human
Capital Management, CRM, Supply Chain and Strategy and Change,
 
22





 
grew revenue in the quarter.
Total signings in GBS increased 12 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in
the first quarter of 2008. Short-term signings increased 14 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency) to $4,147 million. Long-term signings increased 7
percent (decreased 1 percent adjusted for currency).  Within GBS, clients are motivated by projects
with shorter-term paybacks yielding solid economic returns. Signings were
driven by clients globalizing and integrating their businesses, creating shared
services and centers of excellence, innovating in new markets and replacing
legacy systems.

GTS gross profit increased 25.9 percent compared to
the first quarter of 2007, with gross profit margin improving 2.2 points,
driven primarily by strong profit growth in the SO and ITS business lines. Segment
pre-tax profit increased 45.1 percent to $1.0 billion with a pre-tax margin of
9.8 percent, an increase of 2.0 points versus the first quarter of 2007. The margin
expansion was driven by improved productivity and an improved cost structure in
Strategic Outsourcing, a mix to higher value offerings in ITS and lower retirement-related
costs year-to-year.
 
GBS gross profit increased 23.2 percent year to year
and the gross profit margin improved 1.2 points to 25.0 percent. Segment
pre-tax profit increased 23.4 percent to $0.6 billion with a pre-tax margin of
11.2 percent, an improvement of 0.7 points versus the first quarter of 2007.
The margin improvement was driven primarily by effective contract management,
increased utilization and lower retirement-related costs.

Global Services signings are managements initial
estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a Global Services
contract. Signings are used by management to assess period performance of Global
Services management. There are no third-party standards or requirements
governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management
includes an approximation of currency and involves estimates and judgments to
gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of
the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. For
example, for long-term contracts that require significant up-front investment
by the company, the portions of these contracts that are a signing are those
periods in which there is a significant economic impact on the client if the
commitment is not achieved, usually through a termination charge or the client
incurring significant wind-down costs as a result of the termination. For
short-term contracts that do not require significant upfront investments, a
signing is usually equal to the full contract value. Long-term contracts
represent SO and BTO contracts as well as GBS contracts with the U.S. Federal
government and its agencies and Application Management Services (AMS) for
custom and legacy applications. Short-term contracts represent the remaining
GBS offerings of Consulting and Systems Integration, AMS for packaged
applications and ITS contracts.
 
Signings include SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts.
Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the
extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in signings as
maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals.
 
Backlog includes SO, BTO, ITS, GBS, and Maintenance.
Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and
therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and
are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope
of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized
and currency assumptions used to approximate constant currency.
 
Contract
portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog
adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for
initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement
is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Systems
and Technology revenue decreased 6.7 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. Systems and
Technology revenue, excluding the divested printing business, decreased 1.6
percent (7 percent adjusted for currency).
 
System
z revenue increased 10.2 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter versus the prior year, while MIPS (millions of instructions per second)
volumes grew 14 percent year-to-year. These increases were primarily driven by
the successful introduction, in late February, of the new z10 enterprise class
server. The z10 server has up to 70 percent more total capacity and a 100
percent performance improvement on CPU-intensive workloads, which enables large
scale consolidations and unmatched utilization.
 
System
p revenue increased 1.8 percent (down 3 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. The increase in revenue
was primarily driven by strong performance in the POWER6 based midrange
 
24





 
offerings (approximately 60
percent growth), partially offset by a decline in high-end System p offerings,
as clients await the new POWER6 products which were announced on April 8,
2008. The technology innovation and virtualization capability of the POWER6
products provide clients with improved energy and space efficency and enables
substantial consolidation of under-utilized servers.
 
System
i revenue decreased 20.7 percent (27 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. In April, the
company introduced a unified POWER platform which utilizes the same hardware
for both System i and System p. This will provide System i clients full access
to the entire line of POWER-based systems including new blade offerings.
 
System
x revenue decreased 1.7 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2008 versus the prior year. System x server revenue was flat, with
high-end server revenue increasing 13 percent, offset by a decrease in low-end
servers. Blades revenue remained strong, increasing 31 percent versus the first
quarter of 2007.
 
Storage revenue increased 9.6 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. Total disk
revenue increased 6 percent primarily due to double-digit growth in Enterprise
Disk, driven by the  continued strength
of the DS8000, which had revenue growth of 17 percent in the quarter. Tape
revenue increased 18 percent reflecting the value in total cost of ownership,
power consumption and data protection offered by the brands tape solutions.
 
Microelectronics OEM revenue decreased 19.5 percent
(20 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the
first quarter of 2007. The primary mission of this business is to provide
leadership technology for the systems business, as demonstrated this quarter in
the new z10 mainframe and POWER6 systems.
 
Retail
Stores Solutions revenue decreased 3.3 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) versus the first quarter of 2007, while Printing Systems revenue
decreased as a result of the divestiture of the business in the second quarter
of 2007.

combined revenue growth of 17.9 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency).
Japan revenue increased 10.8 percent (decreased 3 percent adjusted for
currency) in the quarter.
 
Across the geographies,
aggregate revenue from the countries comprising the companys new growth markets
unit increased 18.7 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2008 and represented approximately 17 percent of the companys total
revenue.  These growth markets have
economies and IT markets that are growing rapidly, with clients who are
building out infrastructures and creating unique business models that address
scarce resources and rapid business expansion. 
The BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 26.5
percent (14 percent adjusted for currency). Brazil revenue increased 26.7
percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) while Russia revenue increased 38.4
percent (38 percent adjusted for currency). 
India revenue increased 43.0 percent (30 percent adjusted for currency)
and China revenue increased 17.6 percent (11 percent adjusted for currency).
 
OEM
revenue decreased 16.0 percent (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the quarter
driven by reduced demand in the Microelectronics OEM business.
 
Expense
 
Total expense and other
income increased 10.8 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) for the first
quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007. Overall, the increase was due
to approximately 6 points driven by the effects of currency, approximately 4
points due to acquisitions and  2 points
from additional interest expense associated with the financing of the
accelerated share repurchase in 2007, with other operational expense decreasing
year to year. The expense-to-revenue ratio declined 0.1 points to 28.4 percent
in the first quarter 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007.

Total Selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expense increased 10.4 percent (4 percent adjusted
for currency) in the first quarter of 2008 versus the first quarter of 2007.
The increase was driven by the companys investment in acquisitions,
predominantly Cognos, which accounted for approximately 4 points of the
increase. In addition, approximately 6 points of the increase was due to the
impact of currency.

Other (income) and expense
was income of $125 million in the first quarter 2008, versus income of $180
million in the first quarter of 2007. The decrease in income was primarily due
to increased foreign currency transaction losses ($201 million year to year)
partially offset by gains on derivative instruments of $154 million. The
company hedges its major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of
currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging
programs is primarily reflected in Other (income) and expense, as well as cost
of goods sold. The impact of losses from cash flow hedges reflected in Other (income)
and expense was $109 million, an increase of $82 million year to year. In
addition, net gains from securities and investment assets primarily reflects
sales of Lenovo stock in both the current quarter and the first quarter of
2007. As a result of the sale, the companys ownership in Lenovo declined from
8.8 percent at December 31, 2007 to approximately 7 percent with voting
ownership at approximately 3 percent.

The increase in interest
expense was primarily due to higher debt associated with the financing of the
ASR agreements in 2007, partially offset by lower interest rates. See Note 7 on
page 11 for additional information. Interest expense is presented in Cost of
Financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings only if the related
external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. See pages 41
and 42 for additional information regarding Global Financing debt and interest
expense. Overall, total interest expense for the first quarter was $384
million, an increase of $123 million year to year.

Included in the amounts
above, the company had income of $100 million and incurred cost of $313 million
associated with its defined benefit pension plans for the quarters ended March 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in cost was primarily driven by
benefit accruals no longer being recorded for the IBM Personal Pension Plan,
effective January 1, 2008, as well as by lower cost due to amortization of
prior years actual return on assets exceeding expected return on assets and
lower cost due to recognized actuarial losses. 
This decrease in cost was partially offset by an increase in the cost of
defined contribution plans ($234 million). This increase in cost was primarily
driven by pension redesign efforts, primarily in the IBM Savings Plan in the
U.S., effective January 1, 2008. See Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, in
the companys 2007 Annual Report for additional information on these plan changes.
The net year-to-year decrease in cost impacted gross profit, SG&A expense
and RD&E expense by approximately $117 million, $49 million and $20
million, respectively.
 
Acquired Intangible Asset Amortization
 
The company
has been investing in targeted acquisitions primarily within the Software and
Global Services segments to increase its capabilities in higher value market
segments. The following table presents the total acquired intangible asset
amortization by reportable segment included in the referenced category in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings.

Taxes
 
The effective tax rate for
the first three months of 2008 was 27.5 percent versus an effective tax rate of
28.5 percent for the first three months of 2007. The decline in
the rate was due to a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and
an increased benefit from utilization of foreign tax credits associated with
foreign dividend repatriation, offset by a 
reduction in the U.S. research tax credit which expired in
December 2007.
 
With limited exception, the
company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2001. The years
subsequent to 2001 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations
of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or
timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax
audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax
and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result
for these years.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits
at December 31, 2007 determined in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.48,
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109", increased by $288 million in the first quarter to
$3,382 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate is $2,735 million at
March 31, 2008.
 
The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys U.S. tax
returns for 2004 and 2005 in the first quarter of 2007. The company anticipates
that this audit will be completed by the end of 2008.
 
The company has certain foreign tax loss carryforwards that have not
been reflected in the gross deferred tax asset balance. These losses, the
potential tax benefit of which is approximately $1.1 billion, have not been
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the company has
not determined if it will claim these losses. The company is currently
evaluating whether to claim these losses and expects to make a decision within
the next 12 months.
 
See the 2007 IBM Annual Report, Note O,
Taxes, for additional information.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.  Diluted
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options, stock awards and convertible notes.

Working
capital decreased $7,490 million compared to the year-end 2007 position
primarily as a result of a decrease in current assets. The key drivers are
described below:
 
Current assets decreased $4,752
million, including a currency benefit of $1,355 million, due to:
 
·      A decrease of $4,119 million
in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities including a $176 million
currency benefit (see cash flow analysis on page 33); and
 
·      A decline of $1,896 million
in short-term receivables driven by:
 
·      a
decrease of $2,934 million due to collections of higher year-end balances,
offset by
 
·      approximately
$1,038 million currency impact.
 
·      An increase of $565 million
in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily resulting from:
 
·      an
increase of $448 million in derivative assets primarily due to changes in
foreign currency rates; and
 
·      approximately
$77 million currency impact.
 
·      An increase of $384 million
in deferred taxes primarily due to an increase in tax deductions expected to be
realized within the next 12 months.
 
·      Growth of $313 million in
inventory primarily driven by the manufacturing ramp to support the new Systems
and Technology z10 mainframe and POWER6 product announcements.
 
Current
liabilities increased $2,738 million, including a $961 million impact from
currency, as a result of:
 
·      An increase in short-term
debt of $3,000 million driven by the reclass from long-term debt to short-term
debt to reflect debt maturity dates, offset by reductions in commercial paper;
 
·      An increase in deferred
income of $1,277 million driven by Software ($722 million) and Global
Technology Services ($482 million) which includes $397 million due to currency;
 
·      An increase of $652 million
in other accrued expenses and liabilities primarily driven by increased
derivative liabilities due to changes in foreign currency rates;
 
32





 
·      A
decrease in accounts payable of $725 million (including a currency impact of
$204 million) and a decrease of $826 million (including a currency impact of
$138 million) in compensation and benefits reflecting declines from typically
higher year-end balances; and
 
·      A
decrease of $640 million in taxes payable primarily due to income tax payments
in the first quarter of 2008.
 
Cash Flow
 
The
companys cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities, as
reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 5, is
summarized in the table below. These amounts include the cash flows associated

Net cash from operating activities increased $1,186 million as compared
to the first quarter of 2007 driven by the following key factors:
 
·      Increase in net income of
$475 million;
 
·      An increase in cash provided
by accounts receivable of $681 million due to:
 
·      Trade
accounts receivable of $351 million driven by improved collections in the first
quarter of higher 2007 year-end balances;
 
·      Financing
receivables of $330 million primarily resulting from maturities of customer
loans exceeding originations due to higher 2007 year-end balances;
 
·      Lower retirement-related
plan funding of $506 million ($147 million in 2008 for non-U.S. plans versus
$653 million in 2007: $500 million in the U.S. for retiree medical and $153
million funding for non-U.S. plans); partially offset by
 
·      A decrease in cash of $325
million driven by a decrease in tax liabilities due to higher tax payments in
the first quarter of 2008.
 
Net cash used
in investing activities increased $3,360 million driven by:
 
·      An increase of $4,756
million in acquisitions primarily driven by the acquisition of Cognos;
partially offset by
 
·      The net impact of the
purchases and sales of marketable securities and other investments which
resulted in an increase in cash of $1,446 million;
 
Net cash used
in financing activities increased $1,079 million as a result of:
 
·      Increase
of $2,012 million in net cash payments to settle debt; partially offset by,
 
·      Lower
common stock repurchases of $970 million.

·      An
increase of $1,043 million ($463 million due to currency) in prepaid pension
assets.
 
Long-term debt
decreased $3,088 million primarily due to a reclass to short-term debt as certain
instruments approach maturity.
 
Other
noncurrent liabilities, excluding debt, increased $1,484 million primarily
driven by:
 
·      An
increase in retirement and nonpension benefit obligations of $680 million
primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates;
 
·      An
increase of $312 million in income tax reserves reflecting current year
additions related to unrecognized tax benefits;
 
·      An
increase of $175 million in noncurrent deferred income driven primarily by
Global Technology Services; and
 
·      An
increase in noncurrent derivative liabilities of $112 million primarily
resulting from changes in foreign currency rates.
 
Debt
 
The companys funding
requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage
the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains
sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.

Global
Financing provides funding predominantly for the companys external client
assets as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets,
primarily for Global Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams
similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these
Global Services assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing
asset base. The debt analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing
section on pages 41 and 42.
 
In January, IBM
International Group Capital LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the
company, issued $3.5 billion of 18 month floating rate notes. The proceeds were
used to reduce the 364-day bridge loan associated with the 2007 ASR. As of
March 31, 2008, the bridge loan was fully paid off.
 
Non-global financing debt decreased
$1,793 million and the debt-to-capitalization ratio decreased to 26.4 percent
from 30.0 percent at December 31, 2007. The companys long-term
debt-to-capitalization ratio objective is 20 to 30 percent. This ratio can vary
from period to period as the company manages its global cash and debt
positions.

Equity
 
Stockholders
equity increased $258 million primarily as a result of an increase in retained
earnings of $1,737 million driven by net income, partially offset by a decrease
in net stock transactions of $1,611 million.
 
Looking Forward
 
The following key drivers
impacting IBMs business are described in more detail in the 2007 IBM Annual
Report on page 22.
 
·        Economic environment and corporate spending
budgets
·        Internal business transformation and global
integration initiatives
·        Innovation initiatives
·        Open standards
·        Investing in growth opportunities
 
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in 170 countries, with approximately 63
percent of its 2007 revenue and 65 percent of its first quarter 2008 revenue
generated outside the U. S. In addition, approximately 69 percent of the
companys employees are located outside the United States, including about 35
percent in Asia Pacific. This global reach gives the company access to markets,
with well-established organizations and management systems who understand the
clients and their challenges and who can respond to these opportunities with
value-add solutions. The companys transformation to a globally integrated
enterprise provides the capabilities to service clients globally and deliver
the best skills and cost from anywhere in the world.
 
In May 2007, the company met with investors and
analysts and discussed a road map to deliver earnings per share in 2010 in the
range of $10 to $11 per share, or 14 to 16 percent compound growth rate from
2006. The companys 2010 road map is to generate earnings per share growth
through a combination of revenue growth, margin improvement, growth initiatives,
acquisitions, the current projected benefit of retirement-related cost and
effective capital deployment to fund growth and provide returns to shareholders
through dividends and common stock repurchases. In March 2008, the company met
again with investors and analysts and discussed the progress the company is
making on its 2010 roadmap.
 
The companys performance in the first quarter
highlighted the benefits of its global reach and the strength of its business
model. The financial results reflected solid progress on major elements of the
long-term goals, however, the company measures the success of its business
model over the long term, not any individual quarter or year. The companys
strategies, investments and actions are all taken with an objective of
optimizing long-term performance.
 
In the emerging growth markets, the company will
continue to invest for revenue growth and leadership. The company is focused on
identifying growth opportunities and following a disciplined investment policy
to capitalize on these opportunities. Through its investments, the company has
developed extensive capabilities in emerging countries to capture these growth
opportunities. In 2008, the company is implementing a new organization and
management structure that will increase its focus on these emerging nations and
markets.
 
The company
is a proven infrastructure provider of IT technology. The companys broad
product and services portfolio delivers value to clients  through a combination
of services, hardware and software. The portfolio is focused on high-value
solutions that can deliver measurable benefit to clients with offerings that
can address a wide scope of client issues including: energy savings, security
and resiliency, risk management and cost reduction among many others.
 
The company remains committed to technology leadership
and will continue to focus internal investments, complemented with strategic
acquisitions, on high-value, high-growth opportunities. In April, the company
closed on three additional acquisitions that will expand its capabilities going
forward: Telelogic, FilesX Inc. and Diligent Technologies Corporation.
 
The continued investments in Software have led to this
segments emergence as a strong source of revenue growth and the largest
contributor to the companys profit in 2007. The Software business is
differentiated in the industry by both the strength of its individual products
and the breadth of the software offerings. The key to continued Software growth
stems  from the ability to maintain and
grow this industry-leading software business, and by continuing to capitalize
on industry 
 
35





 
trends such
as SOA and Information on Demand. The company expects to accomplish this
through a combination of internal development and strategic acquisitions. These
products will be rapidly developed and integrated to bring continued value to clients.
 
Within the Global Services business, revenue and
profit growth improved and the company continues to see significant results
from the targeted actions and investments it has made the last few years. The
Global Services business enters the second quarter with strong executional
momentum and with a revenue backlog of $118 billion, an increase of $2 billion
from the prior year. The portfolio is strong with a complement of offerings and
capabilities that deliver both high value and productivity to clients. The
overall Global Services business is well positioned going forward to take
advantage of opportunities in the marketplace.
 
In the Systems and Technology business, the company
will focus its investments on differentiating technologies with high-growth
potential including POWER6, BladeCenter-S, high-performance computing,
virtualization and energy efficiency. The transition to POWER6 technology will
be completed in the first half of 2008. The April product announcements in
System i and System p are expected to provide momentum for these brands
going-forward. In addition, the new z10 enterprise class server will be
available for the full second quarter. Within Storage, the company has started
to integrate the recently acquired (December 2007) XIV technologies into its
portfolio.
 
The company expects 2008 pre-tax retirement-related
plan cost to be approximately $1.6 billion, a decrease of $950 million to $1
billion compared to 2007. This estimate reflects current pension plan
assumptions and the impacts of pension plan redesign efforts. See the companys
2007 Annual Report Note U, Retirement-Related Benefits, on page 105 for
additional information.
 
The company expects that its effective tax rate in
2008 will be approximately 27.5 percent. This rate is lower than the 2007 tax
rate of 28.1 percent due to an expectation of a more favorable mix of income in
lower tax jurisdictions and an increased benefit from utilization of foreign
tax credits associated with foreign dividend repatriation, offset by a
reduction in the U.S. research credits which expired in December 2007. The rate
will change year to year based on non-recurring events, such as the settlement
of income tax audits, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix
of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
In 2007 and 2006, the companys cash tax rate was
approximately 18 percent and 16 percent, respectively.
 
The companys cash tax rate represents the amount of
income taxes paid during the year over Income from continuing operations before
income taxes. The cash tax rate differs from the companys effective tax rate
due to a number of variables including, but not limited to, certain items of
income and expense that are recognized in different years for financial
reporting purposes than for income tax purposes, differences in currency rates
used in the translation of the non-U.S. income tax provision and income tax
payments and current year cash tax payments or refunds that are related to
prior years. The company anticipates that its cash tax rate may increase in the
near term as a result of the settlement of audits.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results. At
March 31, 2008, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at
year-end 2007. The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to
limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in the 2007 IBM Annual Report in Note K, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 88 to 91.
 
In the first quarter of 2008,
the company earned
approximately 50 percent of its pre-tax income from continuing operations in
countries other than the U.S. The company maintains hedging programs to limit
the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results. These hedging
programs limit the impact of currency changes on the companys financial
results but do not eliminate them. In addition to the translation of earnings,
the impact of currency changes also may affect the companys pricing and
sourcing actions. For example, the company may procure components and supplies
in multiple functional currencies and sell products and services in other
currencies. Therefore, it is impractical to quantify the impact of currency on
these transactions and on consolidated net income.
 
36





 
Generally, the company
believes that extended periods of dollar weakness are positive for net income
and extended periods of dollar strength are negative, although the precise
impact is difficult to assess.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Generally,
the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and
contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into foreign currency
hedge contracts.
 
Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
In the companys 2007 IBM
Annual Report, on pages 44 to 46, there is a discussion
of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of
data. The table presented on page 44 includes net cash from operating
activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global
credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the three months ended,
or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2008, those amounts are $4.2 billion
for net cash from operating activities, $12.0 billion of cash and marketable
securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.
 
The major rating agencies
ratings on the companys debt securities at March 31, 2008 appear in the
table below and remain unchanged from December 31, 2007. The company has
no contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would
result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

The table appearing on
page 45 of the 2007 Annual Report presents the format in which management
reviews cash flows for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a
description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. While the
company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with
SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, on page 5 of this
Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events underlying sources and uses of
cash in that format on page 33, the following is the management view of
cash flows for the first quarter of 2008 and 2007 prepared in a manner
consistent with the table on page 45 of the 2007 Annual Report:

Free cash flow for the first
quarter increased $776 million versus the first quarter of 2007. The
improvement year to year was driven by the increase in net income, good working
capital management, particularly in accounts receivable, and lower
retirement-related plan funding. There were several significant uses of cash in
the quarter including the Cognos acquisition, capital investments and the
reduction in non-global financing debt. Also, in the quarter, $3.0 billion was
returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 
In
February, the companys Board of Directors authorized $15 billion in additional
funds for use in the companys
 
37





 
common stock repurchase
program. The company anticipates spending up to $12 billion on share
repurchases in 2008. At March 31, 2008, the company had $13.5 billion of share
repurchase authorization remaining.
 
At December 31, 2007, the
company had liabilities of $937 million, representing the fair value of
derivative investments in qualifying net investment hedge relationships. In the
first quarter, the company took actions to reduce hedge levels in some
currencies.  See the 2007 Annual Report,
Note K, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, for additional information. In
the first quarter, the company had a use of cash in investing activities of $82
million related to these instruments. The company will reflect a use of cash in
investing activities of $531 million and $519 million for the years 2008 and
2009, respectively, related to these liabilities.
 
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include
significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic
sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension
funding during periods of severe and prolonged downturn in the capital markets.
Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of
variables, which are more completely described in Note 14 on pages 15 to
17 of this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company is not
quantifying any future impact from pension funding because it is not possible
to predict future movements in the capital markets.
 
Global Financing
 
Global Financing is a
reportable segment that is measured as if it were a standalone entity.
Accordingly, the information presented in this section is consistent with this
separate company view.

The increase in revenue, in
the first quarter of 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007, was
primarily due to:
 
·      An increase in external
revenue of 3.0 percent (3 percent decline adjusted for currency), due to growth
in financing revenue (up 12.3 percent to $495 million), offset by a decrease in
used equipment sales (down 20.7 percent to $138 million); and
 
·      Growth in internal revenue of
10.7 percent driven by an increase in internal financing (up 14.0 percent to
$204 million) and an increase in used equipment sales to the System and
Technology segment (up 7.3 percent to $182 million).
 
The increase in external and
internal financing revenue was due to higher average asset balances and higher
asset yields.
 
Global Financing gross profit
increased 6.5 percent compared to the same period in 2007, with gross margin
increasing 0.4 points. This was primarily due to a mix towards higher margin
financing activity.
 
Global Financing pre-tax
income increased 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the prior
year, primarily driven by the increase in gross profit of $35 million, offset
partially by an increase in selling, general and administrative expense of $14
million.
 
The decrease in return on
equity from first quarter 2008 to the same period in 2007 was primarily due to
a higher average equity balance.

external debt. A portion of Global Financing debt is in support of the
company's internal business, or related to intercompany mark-up embedded in the
Global Financing assets.  See table on
page 42.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
      The primary use of funds in Global
Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets. Client
financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware, software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are
primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for equipment as
well as loans for hardware, software and services with terms generally from two
to seven years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and
services and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to mitigate the associated risk. Loan agreements include
credit protective language and dollar limits on how much can be financed in
order to minimize credit risk. Client financing also includes internal activity
as described on page 51 of the 2007 IBM Annual Report.
 
      Commercial financing receivables arise
primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and
remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment
terms for inventory financing and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.  These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subject to additional credit
actions in order to mitigate the associated risk.

       Cash collections of commercial financing
assets exceeded new financing originations in both the first quarter of 2008
and 2007, which resulted in a net decline in total financing assets for these
periods. The increase in originations was due to improving volumes in
commercial financing.
 
      Cash generated by Global Financing was
primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and dividends to IBM.

*   Represents reserved receivables, net of
recoveries, which were disposed of during the period.
** Primarily represents

       The percentage of financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.3 percent at December 31, 2007, to 1.4 percent
at March 31, 2008 primarily due to the increase in the specific allowance
for doubtful accounts.  Specific reserves
increased 8.2 percent from $230 million at December 31, 2007 to $249
million at March 31, 2008. Unallocated reserves decreased $19 million from
$138 million at December 31, 2007 to $119 million at March 31, 2008 due to the
decline in gross financing receivables.
 
      Global Financings bad debt expense was a
reduction of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008,
compared with a reduction of $8 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2007. The reduction in bad debt expense was primarily due to the
decline in gross financing receivables.
 
40





 
Residual
Value
 
      Residual
value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at
lease inception.  Global Financing has
insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes the recovery
of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used
equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.
Sales of equipment, which are primarily sourced from equipment returned at end
of lease, represented 31.4 percent of Global Financings revenue in the first
quarter of 2008 and 35.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007. The decrease was
due to a decline in external sales, partially offset by an increase in internal
sales. The gross margin on these sales was 44.2 percent and 43.9 percent in the
first quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase was driven primarily
by higher margin internal sales.
 
      The following table presents the recorded
amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and direct financing
leases and operating leases at December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008.
In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31, 2008 is expected to
be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value
below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the
future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. These third-party
guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting
standards in the determination of lease classifications for the covered
equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from declines in
equipment values for these assets. The residual value guarantee increases the
minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a
lease as a sales-type lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values
associated with the guarantees were $198 million and $127 million for the
financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2008
and March 31, 2007, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed
future values at the scheduled end of lease were $12 million and $7 million for
the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31,
2008 and March 31, 2007, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $1.7
million and $0.9 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2008 and
March 31, 2007, respectively.

      The company funds Global Financing
through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1.
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans
and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company
to substantially match the term and currency underlying the financing
receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 39.
 
      The Global Financing business provides
funding predominantly for the companys external clients but also provides
intercompany financing for the company. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as if it were a standalone entity and

is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 38 and
in Segment Information on page 48.
 
       In the companys Consolidated Statement
of Earnings on pages 1 and 2 , however, the interest expense supporting Global
Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of
financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional
information on debt. In this table, Intercompany activity is comprised of
internal loans and leases at arms length pricing in support of Global
Services long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes
these assets should be appropriately levered in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources
 
      Global Financing is a segment of the
company and as such, is supported by the companys overall liquidity position
and access to capital markets. Cash generated by Global Financing was primarily
deployed to reduce debt and pay dividends to the company in order to maintain
an appropriate debt-to-equity ratio.

Looking Forward
 
       The Global Financing business is well
positioned to grow in the current environment. The companys financial position
provides substantial flexibility and funding capacity. Global Financings
assets and new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services
financed to the companys clients and business partners and substantially all
financing assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business
for future growth.
 
       The companys new System z and high-end
System p servers are a significant financing opportunity. Global Financings offerings
are competitive and available to clients as a result of the companys borrowing
cost and access to the capital markets. Overall, Global Financings
originations will be dependent upon the demand for IT products and services, as
well as client participation rates.
 
Interest
rates and the overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an
effect on both revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk
management policy, however, combined with the Global Financing funding strategy
should mitigate gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
42





 
      The economy could impact the credit
quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level
of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous
credit policies in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of
the existing portfolio.
 
      As discussed on page 41, Global Financing
has historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight
into the companys product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
      Global Financing has policies in place to
manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined
with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of
the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to
the economy.

$15.0 billion in funds for use in the companys common stock repurchase
program; the company stated that it may repurchase shares on the open market or
in private transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions
depending on market conditions. See Note 7 on page 11 of this Form 10-Q for
