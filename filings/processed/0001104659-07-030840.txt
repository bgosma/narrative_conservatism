Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.       The accompanying consolidated financial statements and
footnotes thereto are unaudited.  In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), these statements include all adjustments, which are
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, costs, expenses and gains and losses not affecting retained earnings
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures.  Actual results may be
different.  See the companys 2006 Annual
Report for a discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results
for a full year.  The information
included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys
2006 Annual Report.
In the first quarter of 2007, the company changed the
presentation of revenue and cost in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings to
reflect the categories of Services, Sales, and Financing. Previously, the
presentation included Global Services, Hardware, Software, Global Financing,
and an Other category. In the past, these categories were aligned with the
companys reportable segment presentation of external revenue and cost.
However, as the company moves toward delivering solutions which bring
integrated software and services capabilities to its clients, the alignment
between segments and categories will diverge. Therefore, there are situations
where the Services segments could include software revenue, and conversely, the
Software segment may have services revenue. The change was made to avoid
possible confusion between the segment revenue and cost presentation and the
required category presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The change only
impacts the format for the presentation of the companys revenue and cost in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and does not reflect any change in the
companys reportable segment results or in the companys organizational
structure.  The periods presented in this
Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. 
The management discussion and analysis of revenue and gross profit from continuing
operations will focus on the segment view, as this is how the business is
managed and is the best reflection of the companys operating results and
strategy.
Within
the financial tables in this Form 10-Q, certain columns and rows may not add
due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages
presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
2.       The following table summarizes Net income

3.       Stock-based compensation cost is measured
at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over
the employee requisite service period. The following table presents total
stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of

The
reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three-month period
ended March 31, 2007, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior
year, was principally the result of a reduction in the level and fair value
of stock option grants ($8
million) and a reduction related to performance-based stock units ($14
million).
As
of March 31, 2007, the balance of $1,038 million of total unrecognized
compensation costs related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.
There
were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at March 31,
2007 and 2006.
4.       In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which will become effective in 2008. SFAS
No. 159 permits entities
to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm
commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally
accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is
irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in
earnings.  The company will adopt this
Statement in fiscal year 2008 and is currently evaluating if it will elect the
fair value option for any of its eligible financial instruments and other
items.
In September 2006,
the FASB finalized SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements which will become
effective in 2008. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements;
however, it does not require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of
SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively to fair value measurements and
disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and is not expected to have
a material effect on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the first quarter of 2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 156, Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, that
provides guidance on accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and
servicing liabilities. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 156,
separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be
initially measured at fair value, if practicable. Subsequent to initial
recognition, the company may use either the amortization method or the fair
value measurement method to account for servicing assets and servicing
liabilities within the scope of this Statement. The adoption of this Statement
did not have a material effect on the companys Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In the first quarter of 2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 155, Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrumentsan amendment of FASB Statements No.
133 and 140, which permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial
instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
bifurcation in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
The adoption of this Statement did not have a material effect on the
companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
7 


The company
adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
 an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. FIN
48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law.
This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. See Note 5
below for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the
companys Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
5.       As highlighted in Note 4 above, the company adopted the provisions
of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.
The cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in tax reserves and an increase of
$117 million to the January 1, 2007 Retained earnings balance.  Upon adoption, the liability for income taxes
associated with uncertain tax positions at January 1, 2007 was $2,414
million.  This liability can be reduced
by $458 million of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative
effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and
timing adjustments.  The net amount of
$1,956 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the companys effective
tax rate.  In addition, consistent with
the provisions of FIN 48, the company reclassified $1,971 million of income tax
liabilities from current to non-current liabilities because payment of cash is
not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These non-current
income tax liabilities are recorded in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.
Interest and
penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense.
The balance of accrued interest and penalties recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position at January 1, 2007 was $126 million; of this
amount, $95 million was also reclassified from current to non-current
liabilities upon adoption of FIN 48.
With limited
exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or
non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2000. During
the quarter, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced its audit of the
companys U.S. income tax returns for 2004 and 2005. The company anticipates
that this audit will be completed by the end of 2008.  The company does not anticipate a significant
change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12
months.
6.       The company offers defined benefit
pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, as well as nonpension
postretirement plans primarily consisting of retiree medical benefits. The
following table provides the total retirement-related benefit plans impact on
income from continuing operations before income taxes.

$620 million, which is the legally mandated minimum contribution for the
companys non-U.S. plans. In the first quarter of 2007, the company contributed
approximately $153 million to its non-U.S. plans.

The company received a $9.5 million subsidy in the
first quarter of 2007 in connection with the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A portion of this amount is used by
the company to reduce its obligation and expense related to the plan, and the
remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce contributions required by the
participants.  For further information
related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see page 110 in the companys
2006 Annual Report.
In
addition, the company made a $500 million voluntary cash contribution to the
U.S. nonpension postretirement benefit plan in March of 2007. This advance
funding is in addition to ongoing contributions of approximately $400 million
that will be made in 2007 which will be utilized to pay current year benefits.
The $500 million contribution will be used to fund benefit payments in future
years.

7.       During
the three months ended March 31, 2007, the company completed four acquisitions
at an aggregate cost of $251 million.
The
Software segment completed two acquisitions: Consul Risk Management
International BV., a privately
held company, and Vallent Corporation, a privately held company. Each
acquisition further complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of
product offerings.
Global
Technology Services (GTS) completed two acquisitions: Softek Storage Solutions
Corporation, a privately held company and DM Information Systems, Ltd., a
privately held company. Softek augments the companys unified data mobility
offerings and worldwide delivery expertise for managing data in storage array,
host and virtualized IT environments. DMIS will enhance and complement the
companys Technology Service offerings.
Purchase
price consideration was paid all in cash. These acquisitions are reported in
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash
equivalents.
The
table below reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the
resulting purchase price allocations as of March 31, 2007.

The
acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions, and accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce,
neither of which qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. None of the
goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The overall weighted-average life of
the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 3.6 years. With the
exception of goodwill, these identified intangible assets will be amortized on
a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill of $239 million has
been assigned to the Software ($175 million) and Global Technology Services
($64 million) segments.

(a)       Other intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary
business processes, methodologies and systems and impacts from currency
translation.
The
net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $45 million during the first
quarter of 2007, primarily due to the amortization of existing intangible asset
balances, partially offset by capitalized software additions and acquired
intangible assets. The aggregate intangible amortization expense was $291
million and $265 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. In addition, in the first quarter, the company retired $209
million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying
amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
The
amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years relating to
intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position is estimated to be the following at March 31, 2007:



2007 (for Q2-Q4)


 


$


797 million


 




2008

9.       The
table on page 43 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results of the companys reportable
segments consistent with the management system used by the companys chief
operating decision maker. These results are not necessarily a depiction that is
in conformity with GAAP. For example, employee retirement plan costs
are developed using actuarial assumptions on a country-by-country basis and
allocated to the segments based on headcount. 
Different results could occur if actuarial assumptions that are unique
to the segments were used. Performance measurement is based on income before
income taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in part, by management,
both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of
the segments.

following periods: (1) the second-quarter of 2005; (2) the fourth-quarter 2002
actions associated with the acquisition of the PricewaterhouseCoopers
consulting business; (3) the second-quarter of 2002 associated with the
Microelectronics Division and the rebalancing of both the companys workforce

*                    The other adjustments column in the
table above principally includes the reclassification of non-current to current
and foreign currency translation adjustments. In addition, during the quarter
ended March 31, 2007, net adjustments to increase previously recorded
liabilities for actions taken prior to 1994 ($2.6 million) were recorded:
$2.3 million was included in Selling, General and Administrative expense
and $0.3 million was recorded in Other (income) and expense.  In addition, interest expense (accretion) of
$7.3 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense and
$1 million was recorded in Other (income) and expense.
11.     The company is involved in a variety of
claims, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time in
the ordinary course of its business, including actions with respect to
contracts, intellectual property, product liability, employment, benefits,
securities and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a
number of different constituents, including competitors, partners, clients,
current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders
and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. The
following is a discussion of some of the more significant legal matters
involving the company.
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court in
Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group. The company removed the case to Federal
Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to some of
AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify and
focus the issues in the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for
summary judgment were heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its
decision. A trial date has not been set.
In May
2005, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the companys motion to review and
reverse a Louisiana state courts certification of a nationwide class in a case
filed against the company in 1995. The class consists of certain former
employees who left the company in 1992, and their spouses. They claim damages
based on the companys termination of an education assistance program. On April
4, 2006, the trial court denied the companys motion for summary judgment. On
October 27, 2006, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied IBMs writ seeking an
appeal of the trial courts decision to deny summary judgment. At present,
trial briefs are due in June 2007.  No
date has been set for trial.
On
June 2, 2003, the company announced that it received notice of a formal,
nonpublic investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
SEC sought information relating to revenue recognition in 2000 and 2001
primarily concerning certain types of client transactions. The company believes
that the investigation arises from a separate investigation by the SEC of
Dollar General Corporation, a client of the companys Retail Stores Solutions
unit, which markets and sells point-of-sale products.
12 


 
On
January 8, 2004, the company announced that it received a Wells Notice from
the staff of the SEC in connection with the staffs investigation of Dollar
General Corporation, which as noted above, is a client of the companys Retail
Stores Solutions unit. It is the companys understanding that an employee in
the companys Sales & Distribution unit also received a Wells Notice from
the SEC in connection with this matter. The Wells Notice notifies the company
that the SEC staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil
action against the company for possible violations of the U.S. securities laws
relating to Dollar Generals accounting for a specific transaction, by
participating in and aiding and abetting Dollar Generals misstatement of its
2000 results. In that transaction, the company paid Dollar General $11 million
for certain used equipment as part of a sale of IBM replacement equipment in
Dollar Generals 2000 fourth fiscal quarter. Under the SECs procedures, the
company responded to the SEC staff regarding whether any action should be
brought against the company by the SEC. The separate SEC investigation noted
above, relating to the recognition of revenue by the company in 2000 and 2001
primarily concerning certain types of client transactions, is not the subject
of this Wells Notice.
On
June 27, 2005, the company announced that it had received a request to
voluntarily comply with an informal investigation by the staff of the SEC
concerning the companys disclosures relating to the companys first-quarter
2005 earnings and expensing of equity compensation. On January 12, 2006, the
company announced that it received notice of a formal, nonpublic investigation
by the SEC of this matter. The company has been cooperating with the SEC, and
will continue to do so. The SEC has informed the company that the investigation
should not be construed as an indication that any violations of law have
occurred.
In
July 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York related to the companys disclosures concerning
first-quarter 2005 earnings and the expensing of equity compensation. Pursuant
to an Order from the Court dated March 28, 2006, the two lawsuits were
consolidated into a single action captioned In re International Business
Machines Corp. Securities Litigation. 
Plaintiffs filed a corrected consolidated amended complaint dated May
19, 2006, in which they named the company and IBMs Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer as defendants and alleged that defendants made certain
misrepresentations and omissions in violation of Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  On September 20, 2006, the Court denied a
Motion to Dismiss that was filed by IBM. 
On March 12, 2007, the plaintiffs class was certified.
In
January 2004, the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea announced it
had brought criminal bid-rigging charges against several companies, including
IBM Korea and LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and LG Electronics,
which has since been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and had also charged
employees of some of those entities with, among other things, bribery of
certain officials of government-controlled entities in Korea and bid rigging.
IBM Korea and LG IBM cooperated fully with authorities in these matters. A
number of individuals, including former IBM Korea and LG IBM employees, were
subsequently found guilty and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM were also
required to pay fines. Debarment orders were imposed at different times,
covering a period of no more than a year from the date of issuance, which
barred IBM Korea from doing business directly with certain
government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment orders have since
expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM Korea from selling
products and services to business partners who sold to government-controlled
entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have
both contacted the company in connection with this matter.
On
January 24, 2006, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against IBM in
federal court in San Francisco on behalf of technical support workers whose
primary responsibilities are or were to install and maintain computer software
and hardware. The complaint was subsequently amended on March 13, 2006. The
First Amended Complaint, among other things, adds four additional named
plaintiffs and modifies the definition of the workers purportedly included in
the class. The suit, Rosenburg, et. al., v. IBM, alleges the company failed to
pay overtime wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act and state law, and
asserts violations of various state wage requirements, including recordkeeping
and meal-break provisions. The suit also asserts certain violations of ERISA.
Relief sought includes back wages, corresponding 401(k) and pension plan
credits, interest and attorneys fees. On January 11, 2007, the District Court
granted preliminary approval to a class-wide settlement whereby IBM will place
into a fund $65 million, plus certain interest accruing between December 1,
2006 until such time as the fund is transferred to the claims administrator, to
pay claims asserted by class members, Plaintiffs attorneys fees and
administrative costs. Individual payments will be based on factors, including the
class members state of employment, time worked in the relevant job position
and base salary. The District Court is scheduled to have a hearing to finally
approve the settlement in July 2007. The charge associated with this settlement
was consistent with a provision previously established by the company.
13 


 
On
October 23, 2006, the company filed two lawsuits against Amazon.com, Inc.
(Amazon), in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas, one in the Lufkin Division and one in the Tyler Division. The Lufkin
suit alleges that Amazon has unlawfully infringed three IBM patents. The Tyler
suit alleges that Amazon has unlawfully infringed two IBM patents. The Lufkin
Division patents cover methods for storing data, presenting applications and
presenting advertising on a computer network. The Tyler Division patents cover
an electronic catalog requisition system and related information retrieval and
ordering methods and a computer-implemented hypertext system and method for
operating a computer-implemented object-oriented hypertext system. Each suit
seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and injunctive relief. On
December 14, 2006, Amazon answered, counterclaimed in each suit and sought to
transfer the Lufkin suit to consolidate it with Tyler suit. IBM filed its
opposition to the transfer motion on January 2, 2007 and answered the
counterclaims in both suits on January 8. On January 16, 2007, the Lufkin court
denied Amazons transfer motion. The courts have issued scheduling orders in both
suits. The Lufkin action is set for trial on May 6,  2008 and the Tyler action on October 13,
2008.
On
November 29, 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc.
(PSI) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. IBM asserted claims for patent infringement and breach of contract in
connection with PSIs development and marketing of a computer system that PSI
says is compatible with IBMs S/390 and System z architectures. IBM also sought
a declaratory judgment that its refusal to license its patents to PSI and
certain of its software for use on PSI systems does not violate the antitrust
laws. IBM seeks damages and injunctive relief. On January 19, 2007, PSI
answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims against IBM for alleged
monopolization and attempted monopolization, tying, violations of New York and
California statutes proscribing unfair competition, tortious interference with
the acquisition of PSI by a third party and promissory estoppel. PSI also
sought declaratory judgments of noninfringement of IBMs patents and patent
invalidity. The court has not yet set a trial date.
In
October 2003, a purported collective action lawsuit was filed against IBM in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by ten
former IBM employees alleging, on behalf of themselves and allegedly similarly
situated former employees, that the company engaged in a pattern and practice
of discriminating against employees on the basis of age when it terminated
employees in connection with reductions in force. Initially, the District Court
dismissed the lawsuit on the basis of release agreements signed by all the
plaintiffs. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial courts finding
that the release barred these claims, and in January 2007 after denial of IBMs
petition for rehearing, the matter was returned to the trial court for further
proceedings.
The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Similar to many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax
litigation matters. These matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the
importation of computer software. The total amounts related to these matters
are approximately $1.7 billion, including amounts currently in litigation and
other amounts. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that
these amounts are not meaningful indicators of liability.
In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5), the
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any provisions are reviewed at
least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impact and status of
settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information pertinent to a
particular matter. Any recorded liabilities for the above items, including any
changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, were not
material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its experience, the
company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters referred to
above are not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters previously discussed. While the
company will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters, it is
possible that the companys business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the
resolution of one or more of these matters.

Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on the
companys Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and
circumstances of the particular matter which may give rise to additional
factors.
12.     The companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include
unused amounts of $3,670 million and $2,895 million at March 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to
the companys business partners to support their working capital needs. In
addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients
in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $2,796 million
and $2,496 million at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
The company has applied the disclosure provisions of
FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses.
These disclosure provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5, by requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of
guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is
remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is
the guarantor.
The company is a party to a variety of agreements
pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect
to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of
contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily
agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of
representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets
sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the company
to challenge the other partys claims. Further, the companys obligations under
these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some
instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain
payments made by the company.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential
amount of future payments under these or similar agreements, due to the
conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the companys business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, the company guarantees certain loans
and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these
financial guarantees was $30 million and $32 million at March 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.
Changes in the companys warranty liability balance

13.     Subsequent Events:  On April 24, 2007, the company announced that
the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common
share.  The dividend is payable June 9,
2007 to shareholders of record on May 10, 2007. The dividend declaration
represents an increase of $0.10, or 33 percent more than the prior quarterly
dividend of $0.30 per common share. In the last two years the company has
doubled its quarterly dividend.
On  April 24, 2007, the company announced that
the Board of Directors authorized $15 billion in additional funds for use
in the companys common stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to
approximately $1.4 billion for common stock repurchase remaining from a prior
Board authorization. With this new approval, the company has approximately $16.4 billion
available for its stock repurchase program. The company may repurchase shares
on the open market or in private transactions, including structured or
accelerated transactions, depending on market conditions. The company intends
to borrow a large portion of the funds for this repurchase, and maintain
increased financial leverage. At this time, the company does not anticipate
requesting Board approval for additional funds for stock repurchases within the
next 12 months.

*                    The following
Results of Continuing Operations discussion does not include the hard disk
drive (HDD) business that the company sold to Hitachi, Ltd. on December 31, 2002. The HDD business was accounted
for as a discontinued operation under generally accepted accounting principles.
There were no losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2007 and 2006.
**             3.6
percent adjusted for currency
Within the Management Discussion, selected references
to adjusted for currency or at constant currency are made so that the
companys financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period
comparisons of the companys business performance.
Total revenue increased 6.6
percent as reported, 3.6 percent adjusted for currency versus the first quarter
of 2006. Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $2,579 million, up 5.7
percent versus the first quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations was $1.21 versus $1.08, a 12.0 percent improvement
year-to-year.
The companys financial performance in the quarter
demonstrated the value of its global integration. The company has been making
investments for sometime to build global capabilities, transform its operations
and extend its global reach. This quarter, the companys strong performance in
Asia Pacific, combined with improved performance in Europe, more than offset
weakness in the United States. In addition, the company continued to benefit
from strong growth in its emerging country markets where revenue grew 24.1
percent (21 percent adjusted for currency).
The increase in revenue was
driven by an 8.8 percent increase in Software, reflecting double-digit growth
in key branded middleware, a 7.0 percent increase in Global Technology Services
led by Integrated Technology Services and an increase of 8.7 percent in Global
Business Services with improved revenue growth in all three geographies.  In addition, Systems and Technology revenue
increased 2.3 percent primarily driven by strong growth in System p and System
z products, partially offset by an anticipated decline in Microelectronics and
weaker performance in System Storage. Global Financing revenue increased 5.6
percent reflecting an improvement in financing revenue due to an increase in
used equipment sales and financing assets.
The gross profit margin was
40.2 percent, an increase of 1.1 points versus the prior year driven by
improvements in Systems and Technology and Global Business Services. This is
the 11th consecutive quarter that the gross profit
margin
17 


has increased, driven by an
improving business mix and productivity initiatives.
Total expense and other
income increased 11.3 percent versus the first quarter of 2006 driven by the
companys continuing investments in higher value capabilities.
The companys effective tax
rate for the first three months of 2007 was 28.5 percent versus 30.0 percent in
the first quarter of
2006.
Total Assets declined $1.6 billion from December 31,
2006 primarily due to lower accounts receivable ($2.8 billion), partially
offset by increases in Goodwill ($0.2 billion) and pension assets ($0.4
billion).
Global Services signings
were $11.1 billion for the quarter, down 2 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2006. The estimated Global Services backlog ended at $115 billion,
versus $116 billion at December 31, 2006.

The companys two services segments, Global Technology
Services and Global Business Services, together had revenue of $12.4 billion,
an increase of 7.6 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter
of 2007 when compared to the first quarter of 2006. Global Business Services
delivered strong results for both revenue and profit growth in the quarter.
Global Technology Services (GTS) revenue increased 7.0 percent (4
percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter versus the first quarter of
2006, led by strong growth in Integrated Technology Services. Total signings in
GTS decreased 6 percent in the first quarter of 2007, with longer term signings
decreasing 9 percent partially offset by increased shorter term signings of 5
percent.
Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 5.8 percent (3 percent adjusted
for currency) in the quarter driven by growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA,
partially offset by weakness in the Americas. Total SO signings in the first quarter
were down 11 percent when compared with first quarter of 2006.
Business Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) revenue decreased 0.1 percent
(3 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 when compared to
the first quarter of 2006. Double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA was
offset by decreased revenue in the Americas driven by the impact from a large
contract renegotiation in 2006.  BTO
signings increased 7 percent year to year.
Integrated Technology Services (ITS) revenue increased 12.5 percent (9
percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter versus the comparable
period of 2006. The company continues to see progress from the changes
implemented to improve the ITS business, particularly in Asia Pacific and parts
of Europe. In addition, the acquisition of Internet Security Systems, which
added to the companys capabilities in security and intrusion protection,
contributed to the growth this quarter. ITS signings were up 5 percent year to
year.
Maintenance revenue increased 6.3 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) in the quarter, driven primarily by increased availability services
on non-IBM IT equipment.
Global Business Services (GBS) revenue increased 8.7 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the year ago period,
reflecting improved revenue growth rates 
in all three geographies with the strongest growth in Asia Pacific. From
an offering perspective, the strongest growth was in the areas of supply chain,
business strategy and change and in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) driven
offerings, where the company continues to extend its leadership by helping
clients to build strategic new solutions in partnership with the companys
Software business and Research Division. 
Total signings in GBS increased 3 percent in the first quarter of 2007.
Shorter term signings increased  13
percent year to year and were up in all geographies, led by the Americas and
Asia Pacific. This was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit short term
signings growth. Longer term signings were down 22 percent, as growth in
signings for Application Management Services was offset by declines in the
companys U.S. Federal business.

Global Technology Services gross profit margin was 29.2 percent, flat
year to year, and the segment pre-tax margin was 7.8 percent in the first
quarter, a decline of 2.5 points versus the first quarter of 2006.  The pre-tax margin decline was driven by
increased investments in sales and delivery, as well as the impact of recently
completed acquisitions.  The company
continues to increase its investments in technology, tools and processes to
improve service delivery and client satisfaction in outsourced accounts.  Gross margins improved in Asia Pacific, but
cost issues in strategic outsourcing impacted margins in the U.S. The company
is implementing actions to improve the profitability of the GTS business, with
a specific focus on the U.S. cost base.
Global Business Services gross profit margin was 23.8 percent in the
quarter, an improvement of 2.5 points versus the prior year.  The GBS segment pre-tax margin was 10.5
percent, an increase of 2.0 points year to year with pre-tax income growing 32
percent versus the prior year. This profit expansion was driven by higher
revenue growth and utilization, improved pricing and strong contract
management.
Global Services Signings
In first-quarter of 2007, total Global Services signings
decreased 2 percent year to year to $11,084 million. Shorter term signings,
driven by demand for both ITS and Consulting and Systems Integration offerings,
were $5,255 million, up 10 percent. This was the third consecutive quarter of
signings growth in these short term businesses. Longer term signings were
$5,829 million, down 11 percent year to year when compared to first-quarter
2006.  GTS signings were $6,845 million and GBS signings were $4,239
million in the first quarter of 2007.  In
the first quarter, the company signed 9 deals greater than $100 million and the
total Global Services backlog was estimated at $115 billion, an increase of
$4.9 billion versus March 31, 2006 and down $0.2 billion from December 31,
2006.

Global Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value
of a clients commitment under a Global Services contract. Signings are used by
management to assess period performance of Global Services management. There
are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of
signings. The calculation used by management is an approximation of constant
currency, and involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients
commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence
of termination charges or wind-down costs. For example, for longer term
contracts that require significant upfront investment by the company, the
portions of these contracts that are a signing are those periods in which there
is a significant economic impact on the client if the commitment is not
achieved, usually through a termination charge or the client incurring significant
wind-down costs as a result of the termination. For
20




shorter term contracts that do not require significant upfront
investments, a signing is usually equal to the full contract value. Longer
term contracts represent SO and BTO contracts as well as GBS contracts with the
U.S. Federal government and its agencies and Application and Management Services
(AMS) for custom and legacy applications. Shorter term contracts represent the
remaining GBS offerings of Consulting and Systems Integration, AMS packaged applications and ITS
contracts. These amounts have been adjusted to exclude the impact of year to
year currency changes.
Signings include SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts. Contract extensions
and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the
incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in signings as maintenance
contracts tend to be more steady-state, where revenues equal renewals, and
therefore, the company does not think they are as useful a predictor of future
performance.
Backlog includes SO, BTO, ITS, GBS, and Maintenance. Backlog is
intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and therefore does
include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected
by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts,
periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and currency
assumptions used to approximate constant currency.
Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive
backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements
for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services
agreement is signed incidental or coincident to an acquisition.

Systems and Technology revenue increased 2.3 percent (essentially flat
when adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first
quarter of 2006. System z revenue increased 11.5 percent (8 percent adjusted
for currency) in the first quarter versus the prior year with double digit
growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. MIPS (millions of instructions per second)
volumes grew 9 percent year-to-year, marking seven consecutive quarters of
year-to-year MIPS growth. This sustained growth is supported by strong demand
for traditional mainframe engines, specialty engines for Linux and Java and a
growing recognition of System z as the premier tool for large scale
virtualization. As a result, the company is experiencing new clients and
workload coming to the platform and leveraging the latest technology.
System i revenue decreased 13.4 percent (16 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006,
as sales of upgrades remained weak. Actions taken by the company to reduce
costs, together with sales of high margin Capacity on Demand upgrades helped
improve the brands gross margin year to year.
System p revenue increased
13.5 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007
versus the first quarter of 2006. This reflects the third consecutive
quarter of revenue growth for the System p brand since the introduction of
Power 5+ technology in July of 2006. The company continued to see strong growth in its high-end
systems, as well as its Capacity On Demand offerings, extending its
price/performance leadership and positively contributing to margins.  Clients continue to leverage System ps
native virtualization to consolidate multiple smaller servers into high-end
System p.
System x revenue increased
5.6 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007
versus the prior year. Consistent with industry market dynamics, unit
volumes declined slightly year to year, driven by virtualization.
Virtualization
21 


is driving a consolidation of server deployments on a
single system and this development is positive for the companys strength
across its server platforms.
System x Blades volumes increased 12 percent in the
first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006, however revenue growth
was flat as a result of an increased amount of operating lease activity in the
current quarter.
System Storage
revenue decreased 1.2 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2007 after positive second half 2006 performance. Total disk revenue
declined 2 percent primarily driven by declines in the U.S. Tape products
revenue was flat in the first quarter of 2007 versus the same period in 2006.
Microelectronics
revenue decreased 7.4 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2007 versus a very strong first quarter of 2006. As anticipated,
demand moderated in the first quarter of 2007, as last years game platform
launches drove significant early production volume and revenue.  During the
first quarter, the company announced a joint development agreement with
Freescale Semiconductor on 45 nanometer technology. The company also began
production of its 65 nanometer Cell Broadband Engine chip in its East Fishkill
facility.
Retail Stores Solutions revenue increased 7.0 percent
(4 percent adjusted for currency) versus the first quarter of 2006 primarily
due to clients replacing older technology in favor of integrated retail
solutions in Europe, partially offset by declines in revenue in both the
Americas and Asia Pacific. Printing Systems revenue decreased 11.1 percent (13
percent adjusted for currency) due primarily to lower sales of hardware
products and lower maintenance revenue as a result of a declining install base.

The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to the increase
in revenue as well as the mix of revenue to higher margin products in the first
quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006.
Overall gross margin increased 2.8 points versus 2006.
Margin improvements in System z, System p and Microelectronics contributed 1.6,
1.4 and 0.6 points, respectively to the overall margin improvement. Improved
revenue mix, primarily driven by System z growth, contributed 0.6 points. These
improvements were partially offset by lower margins in System x and System
Storage which impacted the overall margin by 0.7 and 0.6 points, respectively.

Software
segment revenue was $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of
8.8 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting double-digit growth
in the companys key branded middleware.
Key Branded Middleware delivered 16.9 percent growth (13 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007. Leadership products and
strong customer loyalty drove double-digit revenue growth in the WebSphere,
Information Management, Tivoli and Rational brands.  The revenue growth in WebSphere, Lotus and
Rational was primarily organic. The Information Management and Tivoli growth
was significantly enhanced by the companys recent acquisitions. These
acquisitions performed well in the quarter and accounted for more than half of
the growth in key branded middleware in the quarter. Organic revenue
growth slowed from the strong level in the fourth quarter, as some large
customers in the U.S. delayed their purchasing decisions.
Revenue from the WebSphere family of products increased 13.6 percent
(10 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the
first quarter of 2006. The company has continued to build a robust portfolio of
WebSphere products to realize the potential of SOA.
Information Management revenue increased 19.9 percent (16 percent
adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the prior year.
Momentum in the companys distributed relational database products continued
with double-digit revenue growth in the quarter.  The Information on Demand portfolio of
software products builds value around the companys core database
business.  It enables clients to
integrate, analyze and optimize disparate information across their enterprise.
Revenue from these offerings grew 28 percent in the first quarter of 2007.  Results were also strong in the Enterprise
Content Management product set, which was bolstered by the Filenet acquisition.
Revenue from Lotus increased 7.0 percent (3 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2007. 
The companys Lotus products provide clients with collaborative
solutions which enable the integration of people, data and business processes
as part of the companys On Demand and SOA strategies. Customer loyalty to
the Lotus product set remains strong as evidenced by ten consecutive quarters
of revenue growth.
Tivoli revenue increased 17.8 percent (14 percent adjusted for
currency) driven by double-digit growth in the Systems Management, Security and
Storage product segments with strong contribution from the recent acquisitions
including MRO, Vallent and Consul.
Rational revenue increased 15.1 percent (11 percent adjusted for
currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006.  Rationals products provide an integrated
approach to the governance of software development and delivery. This is
resonating well with the companys customers as evidenced by this acceleration
in the  revenue growth rate.
Other Middleware and Operating Systems products revenue decreased 1.9
percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) and increased 0.3 percent (decreased
2 percent adjusted for currency), respectively, in the first quarter of 2007
when compared to the same period of 2006. These product sets include more
mature products which provide a strong revenue contribution despite slight
revenue declines.
Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) revenue increased 4.5 percent (1
percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first
quarter of 2006.  PLM software helps
companies improve their product development processes and their ability to use
product-related information across their businesses.

Revenue
increased in all geographies in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first
quarter of 2006, led by strong performance in Asia Pacific and improvements in
Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA).
Americas
revenue increased 1.3 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency), in the first
quarter of 2007 versus the year-ago period. Revenue in Latin America increased
11.9 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency), Canada increased 1.5 percent
(3 percent adjusted for currency) and the U.S. increased 0.3 percent.  Growth from sales to small and medium
business customers remained fairly steady. However, the company experienced a
slowdown in sales to large enterprises in the U.S.
EMEA
revenue increased 13.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2007 when compared to the first quarter of 2006. In the major
countries, Germany increased 20.1 percent (10 percent adjusted for currency),
the U.K. increased 12.8 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency), France
increased 13.4 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency), Spain increased 20.0
percent (10 percent adjusted for currency) and Italy increased 6.9 percent
(decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency). 
The rate of growth in Germany benefited from an improving economy and
better sales execution.
Asia
Pacific revenue increased 9.7 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006, reflecting solid execution in a strong economy.  This is the third consecutive quarter of
revenue growth in the geography and the best performance in five years.  Revenue increased in all regions, with
double-digit growth in Australia/New Zealand, China and ASEAN/South Asia.  Japan revenue increased 1.1 percent (3
percent adjusted for currency), continuing the recovery started in the second
half of 2006.  Good services signings,
improved execution and implementation of a successful sales capacity
maximization program contributed to the increased revenue.
The
emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China together grew 24.1
percent (21 percent adjusted for currency), driven by continuing customer
investment to build out their infrastructures. Brazil grew 17.4 percent (13
percent adjusted for currency), Russia increased 0.6 percent (1 percent
adjusted for currency), India increased 24.6 percent (24 percent adjusted for
currency) and China increased 34.3 percent (31 percent adjusted for currency).
OEM
revenue decreased 5.1 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter of 2007 when compared to a very strong first quarter of 2006.  As anticipated, demand for the companys game
processors has moderated.
24 


Expense
The
Total expense and other income to revenue ratio was 28.5 percent for the first
quarter of 2007 versus 27.3 percent for the first three months of 2006. The
company has made significant changes to the mix of its business, investing in
higher value capabilities, including strategic acquisitions, while divesting of
commoditizing businesses.  This has
contributed to higher gross margins, which have increased over five points from
2002 to 2006.  These higher value
businesses also require higher operating expenses reflecting the ongoing
investment required to develop and sell higher value capabilities. The company
expects a similar level of expense growth through the second quarter of this
year, with some moderation of the growth rate in the second half of the year.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 10.6 percent
(8 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first
quarter of 2006. The increase was driven by the companys investment in
acquisitions which accounted for approximately 5 points of the increase. The
company has made good progress in integrating the acquisitions completed in the
second half of 2006, but these acquisitions are not accretive in the first
year, and as a result impact the companys profitability in the short term. In
addition, investments the company is making in its software and services
businesses, as well as emerging markets, contributed approximately 3 points of
the increase, and approximately 3 points of the increase was due to the impact
of currency.

Other
(income) and expense was income of $180 million in the first quarter 2007, a
decrease of 27.0 percent versus the first quarter of 2006. The company hedges
its major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility
in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is
primarily reflected in Other (income) and expense, as well as cost of goods
sold. This quarter, losses from derivatives resulted in $95 million of
year-to-year impact to Other (income) and expense. This impact was partially
offset by an increase in net gains from sale of securities, primarily from the
sale of Lenovo stock in the first quarter of 2007. As a result of the sale of
Lenovo stock, the companys ownership in Lenovo declined from 14.7 percent to
11.3 percent, with voting ownership at 7.4 percent.

Provision
for Income Taxes
The
effective tax rate for the first three months of 2007 was 28.5 percent versus
an effective tax rate of 30.0 percent for the first three months of 2006. The decline in the rate was due
to a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and reinstatement
of the U.S. research tax credit passed by Congress in December 2006.
With limited exception, the company is no longer subject to U.S.
federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax audits by taxing authorities
for years through 2000. The years subsequent to 2000 contain matters that could
be subject to differing interpretations
of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or
timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax
audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax
and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result
for these years.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit of the companys
U.S. tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in the first quarter of 2007.  The company anticipates that this audit will
be completed by the end of 2008.

Earnings
Per Share
Basic earnings per
share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
method.  Dilutive potential common shares
include outstanding stock options, stock awards and convertible notes.

Financial
Position
Dynamics
The assets and debt associated with the companys Global Financing
business are a significant part of IBMs financial
position. Accordingly, although the financial position amounts appearing on
pages 3 and 4 are the companys consolidated amounts including Global
Financing, to the extent the Global Financing business is a major driver of the
Consolidated Financial Position, reference in the narrative section will
be made to a separate Global Financing section in this Management
Discussion on pages 34 through 38. The amounts appearing in the separate
Global Financing section are supplementary data presented to facilitate an
understanding of the companys Global Financing business.

decreased $2,214 million due to:

collections of seasonally higher year-end balances; this was partially offset
by,
·           An increase of $446
million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Current
liabilities decreased $3,328 million as a result of:
·           Decrease
of $2,574 million in Taxes payable primarily due to the adoption of FIN 48;
consistent with the provisions of FIN 48, $2,066 million of income tax liabilities
was reclassified from current to non-current liabilities because payment is not
anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date; the balance of the
reduction was related to payments in the quarter; and
28 


·           Decrease
of $1,104 million in Accounts payable and a decrease of $981 million in
Compensation and benefits, primarily resulting from declines in balances from
typically higher year-end levels.
These declines
were partially offset by an increase of $759 million in Short-term debt driven
by an increase in commercial paper balances.

Net
cash from operating activities decreased $94 million compared to the first
quarter of 2006 driven by the following key factors:
·           Lower
cash provided by accounts receivable of $624 million as the company experienced
weakness in accounts receivable performance in Europe and the Americas and
improved volumes in commercial financing; partially offset by
·           Lower
retirement-related plan funding of $478 million ($1,131 million
funding of non-U.S. plans in 2006 versus $653 million in 2007: $500 million
in the U.S. for retiree medical and $153 million funding for non-U.S.
plans); and
·           Increase
in net income of $136 million.
Net cash used in
investing activities declined $1,589 million driven by:
·           Decrease
of  $1,203 million in net purchases of
marketable securities and other investments mainly due to increased net
proceeds from short-term marketable securities; and
·           Decrease
of $543 million in acquisitions; and an
·           Increase
of $157 million in net capital spending driven by increased investments in the
SO business and global infrastructure.
Net cash used in
financing activities decreased $836 million as a result of:
·           Increase
of $1,328 million in net cash proceeds from debt; partially offset by,
·           Higher
common stock transactions  net ($354 million) primarily due to the companys
ongoing stock repurchase program; and
·           Higher
dividend payments ($138 million).

The increase in Non-current
assets of $599 million was driven by:
·                  Increase of $365
million in prepaid pension assets partially due to contributions made to
certain non-US plans; and
·                  Increase of $249
million in goodwill driven by the companys acquisitions in the first quarter
of 2007.
Long-term debt
increased $504 million primarily due to new borrowings in the first quarter.
Other Non-current
liabilities, excluding debt, increased $1,906 million primarily driven by a
reclass from current to non-current taxes payable of $2,066 million resulting
from the implementation of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.  At this time, the company is unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual fiscal years
beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The
increase in non-current income tax liabilities  was partially offset by a decrease of $402
million in Retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations
primarily driven by the $500 million funding of the U.S. nonpension
postretirement plan.
Debt
The
companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are
executed to manage the companys overall asset and liability profile.
Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global
funding sources as needed.

Non-global
financing debt increased $302 million and the debt-to-capitalization ratio
increased to 2.8 percent.
Equity
Stockholders equity
decreased $697 million primarily as a result of a decrease related to net stock
transactions of $2,438 million, driven by the companys ongoing common stock
repurchases.
This reduction was offset
by:
·                  An increase in
retained earnings driven by net income of $1,844 million and the $117 million
cumulative catch adjustment to the retained earnings opening balance related to
the implementation of FIN 48, offset primarily by dividends ($452 million); and
·                  An increase of
$294 million in Accumulated gains and (losses) not affecting retained earnings
primarily resulting from the amortization in the first quarter of 2007 of the
non-cash equity impacts ($208 million) related to the implementation of SFAS
No. 158.

Looking Forward
The
following key drivers impacting IBMs business are described in more detail in
the 2006 IBM Annual Report on page 21.
·        Economic
environment and corporate spending budgets
·        Internal
business transformation and global integration initiatives
·        Innovation
initiatives
·        Open
standards
·        Investing
in growth opportunities
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in 170 countries, with approximately 60
percent of its revenue generated outside the U. S. In addition, approximately
65 percent of the companys employees are located outside the United States,
including about 30 percent in Asia Pacific. This global reach gives the company
access to markets, with local management teams who understand the clients and
their challenges and who can respond to these opportunities with value-add
solutions.
The companys long-term
financial model objective is to generate 10 to 12 percent earnings per share
growth over the long term through a combination of revenue growth,
productivity-driven margin improvement and effective capital deployment for
acquisitions and returns to shareholders through dividend and common stock
repurchases.
The companys performance
in the first quarter highlighted the benefits of its global reach and the
strength of its business model. Looking-forward, the company anticipates
continuing benefits from its transformation into a globally-integrated
enterprise.
The company will continue
to selectively pursue acquisitions to expand its capabilities. The company has
a targeted acquisition strategy and has developed the ability to efficiently
acquire, integrate and accelerate new product and service offerings. In
addition, the company will continue to evaluate underperforming and less
strategic areas of its portfolio.
Within
Software, the company expects its Key Branded Middleware products to benefit
from continued development and sales investments targeted at emerging
geographic markets and key product technologies such as SOA and Information on
Demand. In addition, targeted acquisitions will continue to broaden the companys
software capabilities.
In its Global Services
business, the company has achieved improved revenue growth and profit expansion
in GBS as a result of targeted actions and the operational transformation of
the business that has been ongoing over the past 18 months. This accelerated
revenue growth, combined with margin expansion, generated segment pre-tax
profit growth of over 30 percent in the first quarter. The company looks to
maintain that momentum. Going-forward, within GTS, the company is implementing
a series of actions to address the U.S. cost base, including a focus on
resource and cost management disciplines and rebalancing resources as the
company executes it global resource strategy. 
The company expects these actions to take a quarter to implement, but
anticipates improvement in the GTS pre-tax margin beginning in the third
quarter.
The Systems and
Technology business remains the leader in servers. Going forward, the company
will focus its investments on differentiating technologies with high-growth
potential including POWER6, blades, high-performance computing and energy
efficiency. In the Microelectronics business, the company anticipates that game
processor demand will continue to moderate through the first half of 2007 given
the seasonality of the consumer segment.
As discussed in note X, Subsequent
Events on page 115 in the companys 2006 Annual Report, the company will form
a joint venture with Ricoh based on the companys Printing Systems Division and
initially have a 49 percent ownership interest in the joint venture. This
transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007, and the company
will continue to operate this business in the normal course until the closing.
The
amount of IP and custom development income has been declining in recent years.
A moderate declining trend may continue as the company does not expect IP
and custom development income to be a contributor to growth in earnings.
31 


 
Total
retirement-related plan expense increased in the first quarter 2007, as
compared with the first-quarter 2006, by $20 million as discussed on
page 27. For the full year, the company estimates pre-tax
retirement-related plan expense to increase approximately $100 million when
compared to 2006. This expected year-to-year change is primarily driven by an
increase in the cost of defined contribution plans. The cost of defined
benefit plans is estimated to be essentially flat year to year as increases due
to changes in the actuarial assumptions (used to determine 2007 expense) will
be offset by expected savings due to better-than-expected 2006 return on asset
performance.
The company expects
stock-based compensation expense to decline in 2007 when compared with 2006.
The anticipated decline is expected to be less than $100 million on a pre-tax
basis.
The
company expects that its effective tax rate in 2007 will be approximately 28.5
percent. This rate is lower than the companys historical expected rate of 30
percent due to an expectation of a more favorable mix of income in lower tax
jurisdictions. The rate will change year to year based on non-recurring events,
such as the settlements of income tax audits, as well as recurring factors
including the geographic mix of income before taxes, the timing and amount of
foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects of various
global income tax strategies.
In
2006 and 2005, the companys cash tax rate was approximately 16 percent.
The
companys cash tax rate represents the amount of income taxes paid during the
year over Income from continuing operations before income taxes. The company
anticipates that its cash tax rate will increase in the near term as the
company has now fully utilized its U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.
Currency
Rate Fluctuations
Changes
in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the
companys results. At March 31, 2007, currency changes resulted in assets
and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more
dollars than at year-end 2006. The company uses a variety of financial hedging
instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions
and other foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency
and hedging appears in the 2006 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and
Hedging Transactions, on pages 83 to 86.
The
company earned approximately 45 percent of its net income in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. The company also maintains hedging programs to
limit the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results.
These hedging programs limit the impact of currency changes on the companys
financial results but do not eliminate them. In addition to the translation of
earnings and the companys hedging programs, the impact of currency changes
also may affect the companys pricing and sourcing actions. For example, the
company may procure components and supplies in multiple functional currencies
and sell products and services in other currencies. Therefore, it is
impractical to quantify the impact of currency on these transactions and on
consolidated net income. Generally, the company believes that extended periods
of dollar weakness are positive for net income and extended periods of dollar
strength are negative, although the precise impact is difficult to assess.
For
non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign
Currency Translation. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these
entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by
entering into foreign currency hedge contracts.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
On
pages 43 and 44 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report, there is a discussion of
the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data.
One table, on page 43, includes each of the past five years of the companys
Net cash from operating activities, Cash and marketable securities and the size
of the companys global credit facilities. For the three months ended or as of,
as applicable, March 31, 2007, those amounts are $3.0 billion, $10.8
billion and $10 billion, respectively.
The
major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at
March 31, 2007 appear in the table below and remain unchanged from
December 31, 2006. The company has no contractual arrangements that, in
the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse
effect on its financial position or liquidity.

The
table appearing on page 44 of the 2006 IBM Annual Report presents the way
in which management reviews its cash flows for each of the past five years and
is accompanied by a description of the way cash flow is managed, measured and
reviewed. While the company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, on page 5
of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and events underlying sources and
uses of cash in that format on page 29 of this Form 10-Q, the
following is the management view of cash flows for the first quarter of 2007
and 2006 prepared in a manner consistent with the table on page 44 of the
2006 IBM Annual Report:

Events
that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above
include significant changes in operating results, material changes in
geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or
future pension funding during periods of severe and prolonged downturn in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 11 on
pages 12 to 15 of this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding,
the company is not quantifying any future impact from pension funding because
it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets.

Global
Financing
Global Financing is a business segment within IBM that is measured as if it were a standalone entity. Accordingly, the
information presented in this section is consistent with this separate
company view.

Global Financing
revenue increased 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2007 versus the same
period in 2006.  External revenue
increased 5.6 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) driven by external used
equipment sales of $174 million in 2007 versus $152 million in 2006, and
financing revenue of $441 million in 2007 versus $430 million in 2006 due to an
increase in the average external asset balance. 
Internal revenue decreased 4.3 percent driven by internal used equipment
sales of $170 million in 2007 versus $223 million in 2006, a decrease of 23.8
percent due primarily to lower sales to the System and Technology segment,
partially offset by internal financing revenue of $179 million in 2007 versus
$141 million in 2006 due primarily to an increase in the average asset balance.
Global Financing
gross profit dollars decreased $29 million or 5.1 percent and gross profit
margin declined 4.1 points for the first quarter of 2007 when compared to the
same period last year.  The decrease in
gross profit dollars was primarily driven by borrowing costs of $234 million in
the first quarter of 2007 versus $181 million in 2006, an increase of 29.3
percent, primarily related to the interest rate environment, and used equipment
sales gross profit of $151 million in the first quarter of 2007 versus $175
million in 2006, a decrease of 14.1 percent due to a decrease in internal used
equipment sales. This was partially offset by the increase in financing revenue
discussed above. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by
lower financing margins due to the higher borrowing costs.
Global Financing
pre-tax income decreased 9.7 percent for the first quarter of 2007 when
compared to the same period last year. 
The decrease was driven by the decline in gross profit of $29 million
discussed above, and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense
of $11 million.
The decrease in
return-on-equity in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2006
was due to lower earnings as well as a higher average equity balance.

(b) These assets, along
with all other financing assets in this table, are leveraged using Global
Financing debt.
(c) Global
Financing debt includes debt of the company and of the Global Financing units
that support the Global Financing business.
Sources
and Uses of Funds
The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to originate client and
commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for end users consist
primarily of IBM hardware, software and services, but also
include non-IBM equipment, software and services to meet IBM clients total solutions requirements. Client financing assets are
primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for equipment as
well as loans for hardware, software and services with terms generally from two
to seven years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for software and
services and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to mitigate the associated risk. Unsecured loan agreements
include credit protective language, security deposit advances and dollar limits
on how much can be financed in order to minimize credit risk. Client financing
also includes internal activity as described on page 49 of the 2006 IBM
Annual Report.
Commercial financing receivables arise primarily from inventory and
accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for inventory
financing and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90
days.  These short-term receivables are
primarily unsecured and are also subject to additional credit actions in order
to mitigate the associated risk.
Originations
The following are total external and internal financing originations.

Cash collections of both client and commercial financing assets
exceeded new financing originations in both the first quarter of 2007 and 2006,
which resulted in a net decline in financing assets in these periods. The
increase in originations was due to improving volumes in both client financing
and commercial financing.
Cash generated by Global Financing was primarily deployed to pay the
intercompany payables and dividends to IBM.

* Represents reserved
receivables, net of recoveries, that were disposed of during the period.
**
Primarily represents translation adjustments.
The percentage of financing receivables reserved remained constant at
1.5 percent from December 31, 2006 to March 31, 2007 with a decline
in gross financing receivables from year-end. Unallocated reserves decreased
18.4 percent from $76 million at December 31, 2006 to $62 million at
March 31, 2007. The decrease in unallocated reserves is due to the
improved credit quality of the portfolio, as well as the decline in gross
financing receivables. Specific reserves decreased 4.4 percent from $294
million to $281 million in 2007. The decrease in specific reserves was due to
the disposition of reserved receivables during the period combined with lower
requirements for additional specific reserves.
Global Financings bad debt expense was a reduction of $8 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2007, compared with a reduction of $12
million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The continued reduction
in bad debt expense was primarily attributed to the improved credit quality of
the portfolio.
Residual
Value
Residual value is
a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is
dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at
lease inception.  Global Financing has
insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them to the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
Global Financing
optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of
lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements
with current clients.  Sales of equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at end of lease, represented 35.7 percent of
Global Financings revenue in the first quarter of 2007 and 39.7 percent in the
first quarter of 2006.  The decrease was
driven primarily by lower internal used equipment sales.  The gross margins on these sales were 43.9
percent and 46.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006,
36 


 
respectively. The
decrease in gross margin in the first quarter of 2007 from the first quarter of
2006 was primarily due to a mix away from higher margin internal sales
activity.
The following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed
residual value for sales-type and operating leases at December 31, 2006
and March 31, 2007. In addition, the table presents the residual value as
a percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of when the
unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31, 2007
is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. The residual value guarantee
increases the minimum lease payments that are utilized in determining the
classification of a lease as a sales-type lease or operating lease. The
aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees were $127 million and $95
million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended
March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, respectively. The associated
aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $7
million and $4 million for the financing transactions originated during the
quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, respectively. The
cost of guarantees was $0.9 million and $1.1 million for the quarters ended
March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, respectively.

Global Financing funds its operations primarily through borrowings
using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1. The debt is used
to fund Global Financing assets and is composed of intercompany loans and external
debt. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to
substantially match the term and currency underlying the receivable. The
inter-company loans are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and debt are
presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 35.
The companys Global Financing business provides funding predominantly
for the companys external clients but also provides intercompany financing for
the company (internal). As previously stated, the company manages and measures Global Financing as if it were a standalone entity
and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings
external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing
Results of Operations on page 34 and in Segment Information on
page 43.
In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 1,
however, the external debt related interest expense supporting Global Financings
internal financing to the company is reclassified from Cost of Financing to
Interest Expense.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Global Financing is a segment of the company and as such is supported
by the companys liquidity position and access to capital markets. Cash
generated from operations was deployed to reduce intercompany payables and pay
dividends to the company in order to maintain an appropriate debt to equity
ratio.

Looking
Forward
Given Global Financings primary mission of supporting IBMs hardware,
software, and services businesses, originations for both client and commercial
finance businesses will be dependent upon the overall demand for IT hardware,
software, and services, as well as client participation rates.
Interest rates and the overall economy (including currency
fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit. The companys
interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the Global
Financing funding strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to changes
in interest rates. The companys policy of matching asset and liability
positions in foreign currencies will limit the impacts of currency
fluctuations.
The economy could impact the credit quality of the Global Financing
receivable portfolio and therefore the level of provision for bad debt. Global
Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies in both the
origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing portfolio.
As discussed above, Global Financing has historically been able to
manage residual value risk through both insight into the product cycles as well
as through its remarketing business.
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each of the key risks
involved in financing. These policies, combined with product and client
knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business going
forward, even during periods of economic uncertainty.
