	Prior literature documents the existence of conditional and unconditional conservatism, which are measured by recognized line items in financial statements. However, little is known about conservatism in narrative disclosure. We investigate whether narrative disclosure is conservative, i.e., whether narratives respond to bad news in a more complete, news-consistent and timely manner than good news. We proxy news by the market returns and measure completeness by the number of words, news-consistency by the marginal change of narrative tone in response to news, and timeliness by the reporting time lag between news release date and disclosure filing date. Using 10-Q and 8-K filings from 1993 to 2020, we find that on average narratives have more number of words, greater marginal change of tone and shorter reporting time lag in response to bad news relative to good news, consistent with narratives being conservative. In addition, we show that firms emphasize bad news more than good news via 10-Q filings, and are more likely to report larger number of 8-K filings and 8-K items per day in response to bad news comparing to good news.

\section{Introduction}
% motivation
Extant literature documents the existence of conditional and unconditional conservatism, whose measurements are derived from recognized line items in financial statements. %recognition conservatism.\footnote{In this paper, we use the term ``recognition conservatism" to denote the union of conditional and unconditional conservatism, whose measurements are both derived from recognized line items in financial statements.} 
In this paper, we add to this prior work by defining and providing evidence of narrative conservatism. We define narrative conservatism as \textit{narratives responding to bad news in a more complete, news-consistent and timely manner than good news}. This definition builds on the work of \fullciteA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}, extending the notion of accounting conservatism to narratives. Narrative conservatism is of interest for at least two reasons. First, narrative disclosure takes up a dominant space in corporate filings.\footnote{For example, Apple Inc.'s 2019 Annual Report contains only 3 pages of numerical summary in the financial statements and around 15 pages of other tables and figures, among a total of 64 pages. The rest of the report is devoted to narratives including risk factors, management discussion and analysis (MD\&A), notes to financial statements, among other things. Also, over the past 20 years, the average number of pages in annual reports devoted to footnotes and MD\&A has quadrupled \cite{eyPointNowTime2012}.} Investors' perceptions of firm performance and subsequent decision-making processes are likely to be shaped by narrative disclosures \fullcite{liTextualAnalysisCorporate2010}. Therefore, understanding the properties of narrative disclosure and their economic implications is essential for market participants and regulators. Second, studying narrative conservatism complements our current understanding of accounting conservatism. If recognition is merely one of the presentation formats of financial reporting, then our extant knowledge of conditional and unconditional conservatism is a partial view of accounting conservatism, which would be comprised of both recognition and narrative conservatism. Yet, we know little about whether narrative disclosure is conservative, or whether and how narrative conservatism interacts with conditional and unconditional conservatism.

%[Theory]
Prior literature distinguishes between recognition and disclosure.\footnote{Recognition is depictions in numbers with captions on the face of the financial statements \fullcite{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007}. Despite the lack of a conceptual definition, disclosure is commonly viewed as display in the notes and supporting schedules that accompany financial statements \fullcite{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007}.} The two forms of financial reporting are subject to different reporting requirements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) explicitly specifies a set of recognition criteria while allowing for more flexibility in disclosure \fullcite{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. This flexibility paves a way for the supplementary role of disclosure---disclosing information that cannot be recognized due to the failure to meet one or more of the recognition criteria. The other explanatory role of disclosure is to provide detailed background information of recognized numbers in financial statements \cite[par. 7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. 

Extensive research has been conducted on conditional and unconditional conservatism, focusing on the properties of the income statement and balance sheet items respectively. Conditional conservatism captures the asymmetric response of \textit{earnings} to positive and negative economic news, and unconditional conservatism manifests as a systematic understatement of \textit{net book value of assets} due to predetermined aspects of the accounting process \cite<e.g.,>[]{beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. However, conservatism in narrative disclosure receives little attention. We interpret narrative conservatism as narratives responding to bad news in a more complete, news-consistent and timely manner than good news. We focus on these three properties of narratives because they correspond to the following three independent dimensions of disclosure: quantity, content and timeliness. Quantity refers to how much disclosure is provided. Content relates to what and how information is provided via disclosure. Timeliness associates with how much time the firms take to provide the disclosure.

In theory, narrative disclosure may or may not be conservative, depending on the role of narratives and managerial incentives. First, when the role of narratives is explanatory (supplementary), the narrative disclosure is more (less) likely to be conservative. Explanatory narratives may be conservative because they are consistent with the recognized line items that they intends to explain, which are conservative given the presence of conditional and unconditional conservatism. Supplementary narratives may not be conservative because they are used to disclose novel information that cannot be recognized, which is more likely to be good news as bad news requires lower verification for recognition. Therefore, in case of bad news, positive tone may still be applied in disclosure, leading to a lower level of conservatism. Second, prior studies outline several incentives for managers to disclose or withhold bad news \cite{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994, skinnerEarningsDisclosuresStockholder1997, kothariManagersWithholdBad2009, baoManagersDiscloseWithhold2019}, which also drive managers' decisions of adopting conservative disclosure policy or not. The three major motives for managers to disclose bad news are: (a) to obtain lower financing costs resulting from reduced information asymmetry, (b) to reduce litigation risk due to the failure to disclose bad news in a timely manner and (c) to manipulate firm performance downwards prior to stock option grant. The two major motives for managers to withhold bad news are: (a) to prevent reputation loss that damages managers' future career and (b) to avoid personal wealth loss linked to performance-based compensation. In summary, given distinct role of narratives and various managerial incentives, on average, whether managers tend to disclose or withhold bad news remains an empirical question.

%[research design]
To empirically test whether narrative disclosure is conservative, we adopt the following three measurements for completeness, news-consistency and timeliness respectively. We proxy disclosure completeness by the number of total words in corporate filings. Prior literature documents that managers use lengthier reports to disclose more information, which reduces information asymmetry and lowers cost of capital \fullcite{leuzDisclosureCostCapital2009}. We interpret news-consistency as a positive narrative tone in response to good news and a negative narrative tone in response to bad news, and we measure the degree of news-consistency by the marginal change of narrative tone in response to unit increase (good news) or decrease (bad news) in stock market returns. If narrative disclosure is conservative, the marginal change of tone in narrative disclosure should be greater in response to bad news than good news. We evaluate timeliness by the reporting time lag between news and disclosure release dates. The smaller the reporting time lag is, the timelier the narrative disclosure is. Overall, we posit that if narrative disclosure is conservative, in response to bad news relative to good news, it should have more number of words, greater marginal change of tone and shorter reporting time lag. In terms of news measurement, we follow \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997} and use stock returns as a proxy for news.

%[data and findings]
We use two types of mandatory filings required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for all public companies---10-Q and 8-K filings---as our narrative disclosure corpora. To begin with, we retrieve 10-Q and 8-K filings from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) from 1993 to 2020.\footnote{Since the SEC adopted the rule of electronical submission for corporate filings in 1993, data coverage in the first year of EDGAR implementation is low \fullcite{gaoInformingMarketEffect2020}. We repeat our main analyses using data from 1994 onward, and our main results sustain.} Next, we apply the financial sentiment word list developed by \fullciteA{loughranWhenLiabilityNot2011} (LM hereafter) to count number of positive, negative, uncertainty, litigious and modal words in each corporate filing extracted from EDGAR. Finally, we construct tone as the number of net positive words per thousand total words and reporting time lag as number of days elapsed between news release date and document reporting date. Our final 10-Q (8-K) sample consists of 91,606 (244,401) firm-quarter (firm-day) observations from 5,250 (8,876) unique firms. Empirical results show that 10-Q (8-K) filings have more number of words, greater marginal change in tone, and longer (shorter) reporting time lag in response to bad news relative to good news, generally consistent with narrative disclosures being conservative.\footnote{All empirical results are consistent with narratives being conservative except that 10-Q filings responding less timely to bad news than good news, which contradicts with narrative conservatism. However, because 10-Q is not as timely as 8-K, and because 10-Q report not only contains narrative disclosures but also financial statements, it does not strictly proxy for narrative timeliness (\hyperref[sec3.1]{Section 3.1}). Therefore, we interpret 10-Q results only as a supplementary evidence when it comes to narrative timeliness. The main conclusions regarding narrative timeliness are drawn based on 8-K results.}

%[contribution]
Our study contributes to the accounting literature in four aspects. First, we fill the missing piece in conservatism literature by documenting the existence of narrative conservatism. Second, we provide novel evidence to the debate regarding whether managers withhold bad news. Prior research uses a variety of disclosure proxies except linguistic properties of narratives to study managers' tendency to disclose or withhold bad news \cite{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994, skinnerEarningsDisclosuresStockholder1997, kothariManagersWithholdBad2009, segalAreManagersStrategic2016, baoManagersDiscloseWithhold2019}. We apply properties of SEC filings as proxies for disclosure, and our results support the idea that firms voluntarily disclose bad news on average. Third, we relate to the broader literature on the informativeness of SEC filings. A stream of literature studies the market reactions to 8-Ks \fullcite{carterRelevanceForm8K1999, pinskerHasFirmsForm2006, lermanNewForm8K2010} and 10-K/Qs \fullcite{alfordExtensionsViolationsStatutory1994, liAnnualReportReadability2008, liInformationContentForwardLooking2010}. Instead, we use the market returns as indication of good and bad news for the firms and study the behavior of corporate narrative disclosure. [Fourth, we add to the literature on distinction and interaction between recognition and disclosure \fullcite{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007, barthMarketEffectsRecognition2003, aboodyRecognitionDisclosureOil1996}.]\footnote{The fourth contribution is yet to be confirmed by auxiliary analyses.}

The rest of the study structures as follows. Section 2 reviews prior literature on recognition, disclosure, conditional and unconditional conservatism, and develops the main hypotheses. Section 3 outlines the empirical design and data selection process. Section 4 presents the main results of 10-Q and 8-K samples. Section 5 performs auxiliary analyses and Section 6 concludes.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
\subsection{Recognition and Disclosure}
% What are recognition and disclosure?
A stream of literature studies the distinctions between \textit{recognition} and \textit{disclosure} and their respective or combined effectiveness in financial reporting \fullcite{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007, barthMarketEffectsRecognition2003, aboodyRecognitionDisclosureOil1996}. \citeA[p. 301]{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007} defines recognition as ``depictions in numbers with captions on the face of the financial statements", and disclosure as ``display in the notes and supporting schedules that accompany financial statements".\footnote{Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5---\textit{Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises} formally defines \textit{recognition} as ``the process of formally recording or incorporating an item into the financial statements of an entity as an asset, liability, revenue, expense, or the like. Recognition includes depiction of an item in both words and numbers, with the amount included in the totals of the financial statements" \fullcite[par. 6]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}, but does not define \textit{disclosure}. Due to the absence of a conceptual definition of disclosure, prior literature on disclosure commonly interpret disclosure as any display that is not in numbers. However, this interpretation may partially overlap with the FASB definition of recognition, which states that recognition also includes words. As \citeA[p. 302]{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007} notes: ``...both in analytical modeling and in developing financial reporting concepts, it is difficult to distinguish between recognized and disclosed information".} In this study, we adopt the same notion of recognition as in \cite{schipperRequiredDisclosuresFinancial2007}, and we use the terms \textit{narratives, narrative disclosure} or \textit{disclosure} interchangeably to denote all textual disclosures presented in SEC filings, including notes to financial statements, supplementary information and other means of financial reporting such as the MD\&A section. Examples of recognition are revenue, expense, asset and liability expressed in currency units on the face of financial statements, which are also known as line items in financial statements. 

% What are recognition criteria and the role of narratives
Disclosure and recognition are subject to different reporting requirements. For an economic item to be recognized in financial statements, a set of recognition criteria needs to be satisfied. First, the item must meet the definition of an element of financial statements (definition criterion). Second, the item must have a relevant attribute measurable with sufficient reliability (measurability criterion). Third, the information about the item must be capable of making a difference in user decisions (relevance criterion). Fourth, the information must be representationally faithful, verifiable, and neutral (reliability criterion) \cite{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. However, disclosure is more flexible because it can be deployed to disclose information that fails to meet certain recognition criteria \cite[par. 7b]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984}. 

Narrative disclosure plays an essential role in financial reporting, as \fullciteA[par. 7, CON5-7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984} states:

\begin{singlespace}
	\indent \textit{Although financial statements have essentially the same objectives as financial reporting, some useful information is better provided by financial statements and some is better provided, or can only be provided, by notes to financial statements or by supplementary information or other means of financial reporting.}
\end{singlespace}

Concretely, narrative disclosure has two fundamental functions. First, narratives can be supplementary to recognition, conveying information about corporate events that cannot be recognized, due to the inability to meet one or more of the four recognition criteria. In terms of good news, because good news requires higher verification in recognition, firms may convey good news via disclosure rather than recognition. For instance, under U.S. General Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP), long-lived tangible and intangible assets cannot be revaluated upwards. So when the market price of the firm's long-lived tangible and intangible assets goes up, the firm cannot recognize the gain in balance sheet, but it may discuss the price movement in SEC filings. In terms of bad news, despite that bad news already requires lower verification than good news, it may still not be fully recognized. For example, although firms could create a provision for the expected payments that results from a potential lawsuit in the future, they cannot recognize the associated reputation losses since it is extremely difficult to obtain a reliable estimate that can be verified subsequently. However, firms may discuss the likelihood and impact magnitude of entering into a lawsuit in the risk factors or the MD\&A section of the SEC filings. Another example is that internally developed intangible assets cannot be capitalized in the balance sheet, so they cannot be impaired when bad news arrives. However, firms may discuss the impact of news associated with these intangible assets in SEC filings. In sum, firms may use narrative disclosure to inform investors about the immeasurable, and thus irrecognizable impact of various corporate events and fulfill their obligation of providing relevant financial information to investors. Second, narratives can be explanatory to recognition, explaining the line items in financial statements. \fullciteA[footnote 4, CON5-7]{fasbStatementFinancialAccounting1984} gives several examples on the explanatory role of notes to financial statements:

\begin{singlespace}
	\indent \textit{For example, notes provide essential descriptive information for long-term obligations, including when amounts are due, what interest they bear, and whether important restrictions are imposed by related covenants. For inventory, the notes provide information on the measurement method used---FIFO cost, LIFO cost, current market value, etc. For an estimated litigation liability, an extended discussion of the circumstances, counsel's opinions, and the basis for management's judgment may all be provided in the notes. For sales, useful information about revenue recognition policies may appear only in the notes (FASB Statement No. 47, Disclosure of Long-Term Obligations; ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, ``Inventory Pricing", statement 8; FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, par. 10; and APB Statement 4, par. 199)}.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Conditional, Unconditional and Narrative Conservatism: Definition}
% What are conditional, unconditional and narrative conservatism.
Prior literature documents conservatism in two forms: conditional and unconditional conservatism \cite{beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. Conditional conservatism manifests as ``accountants' tendency to require a higher degree of verification to recognize good news as gains than to recognize bad news as losses" \fullcite[p. 7]{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997},\footnote{\citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997} does not coin the terms conditional or unconditional conservatism. Here we quote \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997} to describe the manifestation of two forms of conservatism, which are now labeled as conditional and unconditional conservatism.} and is typically measured by the asymmetric response of earnings to positive and negative stock returns. Examples of conditional conservatism include allowing for \textit{impairment}, i.e., writing down by the amount of loss incurred, but not \textit{revaluation}, i.e., writing up by the difference between market price and carrying amount, for long-lived tangible and intangible assets under U.S. GAAP, and lower of cost or market accounting (LCM) for inventory under U.S. GAAP or lower of cost or net realizable value accounting (LCNRV) under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Unconditional conservatism manifests as ``accountants' preference for accounting methods that lead to lower reported values for shareholders' equity" \fullcite[p. 8]{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}. Examples of unconditional conservatism include immediate expensing, rather than capitalizing, of research and development (R\&D hereafter) costs, and the use of accelerated depreciation for property, plant and equipment \fullcite{beaverConditionalUnconditionalConservatism2005}. The measurements of both types of conservatism---earnings and shareholders' equity, are recognized line items in financial statements. %Thus, we label the union of the two forms of conservatism as \textit{recognition conservatism}. 

% What is narrative conservatism and why focus on the three constructs?
Comparing to the extensive research on conditional and unconditional conservatism, little is known about conservatism in narratives. We define narrative conservatism as \textit{narratives responding to bad news in a more complete, news-consistent and timely manner than good news}. We focus on these three properties of narratives because they correspond to the following three independent dimensions of disclosure: quantity, content and timeliness. Quantity refers to how much disclosure is provided, and we interpret completeness as firms providing more disclosure. Content relates to what and how information is provided via disclosure, and we interpret news-consistency as firms using positive tone in response to good news and negative tone in response to bad news in narrative disclosure. Timeliness associates with how much time the firms take to provide the disclosure, and we interpret timely disclosure as the information disclosed as quickly as possible. Each firm can be conservative or not independently along each dimension. In this study, we assess the overall level of narrative conservatism along each dimension independently for our sample firms during the sample periods. 

% Why firms may or may not be conservative?
In theory, narrative disclosure may or may not be conservative, depending on (a) the role of narratives and (b) managerial incentives. First, because narrative conservatism implies that managers disclose bad news in a more news-consistent manner than good news, and given that recognition is conservative overall, narratives may or may not be conservative depending on whether it is explanatory or supplementary to recognition. Explanatory narrative disclosure may be conservative, because it needs to be consistent with the recognized line items that it intends to explain. When bad news arrives, managers recognize the losses in line items and explain the background of the adverse event in footnote using negative tone, so the narratives are news-consistent. While the supplementary narrative disclosure may not be conservative. Because the already recognized line items are most likely to reflect bad news, as it requires lower verification, managers may provide novel information through narratives, which is more likely to be good news because it cannot be recognized under conditional and unconditional conservatism. The tendency to \textit{recognize} bad news and \textit{disclose} good news increases the likelihood of narrative tone being positive. Therefore, when bad news comes, disclosing irrecognizable good news using positive tone in narratives may lead to violation of news-consistency. Second, narrative conservatism implies that managers disclose bad news in a more timely manner than good news. However, managers may or may not disclose bad news when facing different incentives. On the one hand, managers may disclose bad news for three motives. First, managers may disclose more complete information, including bad news, to reduce financing costs. Extant theoretical work establishes that complete disclosure reduces information asymmetry and lowers cost of capital \cite<e.g.,>[]{diamondDisclosureLiquidityCost1991, baimanRelationCapitalMarkets1996}. \fullciteA{leuzEconomicConsequencesIncreased2000} show that information asymmetry is reduced after German firms switched from the German to an international reporting regime which requires an increased level of disclosure, thus decreasing their cost of capital. \citeA{leuzDisclosureCostCapital2009} find that firms respond to the adverse shock created by the Enron scandal by increasing the length of disclosures in 10-K filings, which reduces firms' cost of capital after the scandal. Second, litigation pressure induces managers to disclose bad news more promptly than good news \fullcite{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994, kasznikWarnNotWarn1995, skinnerEarningsDisclosuresStockholder1997}. Financial information users have greater incentives to sue the manager when bad news is not disclosed than when good news is not disclosed. This asymmetric litigation pressure potentially stems from users' asymmetric preference for unexpected gains and losses. Third, the personal career and compensation incentives also play a role in managers' decisions to disclose bad news. \citeA{skinnerWhyFirmsVoluntarily1994} argues that managers may face reputational costs if they fail to disclose bad news. \fullciteA{yermackGoodTimingCEO1997} and \fullciteA{aboodyCEOStockOption2000} document that managers release bad news immediately prior to stock option grant dates to lower the option strike price. On the other hand, managers may withhold bad news for two reasons. First, managers may avoid disclosing bad news for career concerns, in expectation to bury bad news with subsequent corporate events. Significant bad news affects managerial career negatively by deterring promotion, limiting employment opportunity in the outside job market and potentially leading to termination. Second, performance-based managerial compensation also demotivates managers to disclose bad news. Bad news disclosure may lead to bonus shrink and stock price decline, reducing managers' personal wealth especially when they are compensated with shares or options \cite{kothariManagersWithholdBad2009}. In sum, while managers have a natural tendency to disclose good news, they face different incentives when it comes to the decision of disclosing or withholding bad news. Given the different roles of narratives and various managerial incentives, whether narratives on average responds to bad news in a more complete, news-consistent and timely manner than good news remains an empirical question. 

% Empirical proxy choices
To investigate this question, we construct three measurements for disclosure completeness, news-consistency and timeliness. We measure disclosure completeness by the total number of words of SEC filings. Because the Conceptual Framework requires complete disclosures to include ``...all information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon being depicted, including all necessary descriptions and explanations" \fullcite[QC12]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018}, more complete disclosure should be lengthier, which allows managers to elaborate on detailed descriptions and explanations of firm performance \cite{leuzDisclosureCostCapital2009}.\footnote{We use number of words instead of number of pages, which is used in \citeA{leuzDisclosureCostCapital2009}, as the proxy for disclosure completeness for two reasons. First, for pure texts, these two measures are almost equivalent, or at least are monotonic transformations of each other, given a roughly constant number of words per page. Second, for financial reports with graphs and tables, the number of words is a more precise measure for narrative disclosure, because it counts the length of narratives only. However, the number of pages may be enlarged by graphs, tables, and even space lines embedded in the tables, which are not focus of this study.} However, a strand of literature documents that narrative disclosure is less informative when it is less readable \fullcite{liAnnualReportReadability2008, loEarningsManagementAnnual2017, loughranMeasuringReadabilityFinancial2014}, and because lengthier document is often less readable, it may appear counter-intuitive to proxy completeness with document length. We provide two explanations for this measurement. First, several studies point out that instead of managers' intentional obfuscation, lower readability may result from the fact that bad news is inherently more complex and therefore needs more explanations \fullcite{bloomfieldDiscussionAnnualReport2008}, and that there is incremental information content embedded in complex narratives \fullcite{busheeLinguisticComplexityFirm2018}. Therefore, lower readability does not necessarily imply lower narrative disclosure quality. Second, although somewhat correlated, document length and readability are essentially two different constructs. In a binary classification context, texts can be long or short, readable or irreadable independently. Specifically in measuring information completeness, document length is an appropriate construct because ``including all necessary descriptions and explanations" \fullcite[QC12]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018} in narrative disclosure inevitably increases document length. Thus, if narrative disclosure is conservative, we expect it to be lengthier, i.e., contains more number of words, in response to bad news. We formulate our first hypothesis as follows:

\begin{center}
	\textbf{H1:} The total number of words in narrative disclosure is greater in response to bad news than good news.
\end{center}

We proxy the sentiment spectrum in narrative disclosure by linguistic tone and measure the degree of news-consistency by the marginal change of tone in response to unit increase (good news) or decrease (bad news) in stock market returns. News-consistency requires the marginal change to be positive, so that positive tone responds to good news and negative tone to bad news. Furthermore, if the narrative tone is more consistent for bad news, it implies greater marginal change of tone in response to bad news than good news. That is, the change in narrative tone is more negative in response to bad news than it is positive in response to good news, given the same magnitude of news impact. Narrative conservatism creates a downward bias in narrative disclosure conditional on the nature of news: either bad news is emphasized or good news is attenuated, or both.\footnote{We provide the following numerical example to illustrate the concept of marginal change of tone. Suppose that there is 1\% increase (good news) and 1\% decrease (bad news) in stock return, that should move tone upwards and downwards by 1\% in theory if narrative tone is neutral, i.e., equally responding to good and bad news. However, in the presence of narrative conservatism, three situations may happen: (1) bad news emphasis: in response to bad news, tone decrease by 1.2\% and in response to good news, tone increase by 1\%; (2) good news attenuation: in response to bad news, tone decrease by 1\% and in response to good news, tone increase by 0.8\%; (3) a mix of both: in response to bad news, tone decrease by 1.2\% and in response to good news, tone increase by 0.8\%. In all cases, marginal change of tone in response to bad news is greater than that in response to good news. Therefore, under narrative conservatism, the marginal change of tone in narrative disclosure is greater in response to bad news than good news.} Thus, we formulate our second hypothesis as follows:
\begin{center}
	\textbf{H2}: The marginal change of tone in narrative disclosure is greater in response to bad news than good news.
\end{center}

We measure timeliness by the reporting time lag, defined as the number of days elapsed between the news release date and subsequent reporting date of the narrative disclosure. In line with the interpretation of timeliness in the Conceptual Framework that ``Timeliness means having information available to decision makers in time to be capable of influencing their decisions" \fullcite[QC29]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018}, the shorter is the reporting time lag, the timelier is the narrative disclosure. If narrative disclosure is conservative, we expect it to be timelier, i.e., has shorter reporting time lag, in response to bad news. Thus, we formulate our third hypothesis as follows:

\begin{center}
	\textbf{H3}: The reporting time lag of narrative disclosure is shorter in response to bad news than good news.
\end{center}

\subsection{Conditional, Unconditional and Narrative Conservatism: Usefulness}
% conservatism role: stewardship or neutrality
The controversy regarding whether conservatism is a desirable property that enhances the usefulness of financial reporting persists. Traditionally, the usefulness of accounting information can be assessed in terms of how well it serves each of the two objectives of accounting---valuation and stewardship \fullcite{cascinoUsefulnessFinancialAccounting2017}. The valuation objective is to ``provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity \cite[OB2]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018b}". For financial information to be useful for valuation objective, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to represent. Faithful representation further requires neutrality, which means that a depiction must be ``not slanted, weighted, emphasized, deemphasized, or otherwise manipulated to increase the probability that financial information will be received favorably or unfavorably by users". The stewardship objective is to assess ``how efficiently and effectively the entity's management and governing board have discharged their responsibilities to use the entity's economic resources \cite[OB4]{fasbConceptualFrameworkFinancial2018b}". Although not separately stated in the Conceptual Framework as one primary purpose of financial reporting, the stewardship role of accounting dates back several millennia and has been one of the main reasons for the existence of accounting \cite{lennardStewardshipObjectivesFinancial2007, murphyDiscoursesSurroundingEvolution2013, pelgerPracticesStandardsettingAnalysis2016}. On the one hand, conservatism contradicts the valuation role of accounting by introducing downward bias in financial reporting and thus weakening its ability to faithfully represent firm performance. For example, unconditional conservatism encourages firms to anticipate and recognize losses before their realization, resulting in a systematic downward bias in asset valuation \fullcite<e.g.,>[]{wattsPositiveAccountingTheory1986}. Conditional conservatism requires higher verification for good news to be recognized than bad news, leading to asymmetric timeliness in gain and loss recognition in earnings \fullcite<e.g.,>[]{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}. On the other hand, conditional conservatism enhances the stewardship role of accounting by improving contract efficiency. For example, in compensation contracting conditional conservatism limits managers' ability to overstate earnings and thus maximizing personal wealth at the expense of other claimholders \fullcite<e.g.,>[]{wattsConservatismAccountingPart2003}.

Aligned with the prior literature on the usefulness of conservatism, we argue that more complete, news-consistent and timely disclosure of bad news relative to good news enhances contract efficiency [specific hypotheses to be developed]. However, we do not make claims about the valuation role of narrative conservatism.

\section{Research Design}
\subsection{Narrative Disclosure Corpora and News Proxy} \label{sec3.1}
% What are 10-Q and 8-K?
In this paper, we study narrative disclosure using 10-Q and 8-K filings from EDGAR database as our corpora. The form 10-Q is a comprehensive report that depicts quarterly firm performance, and it must be filed by all public companies to the SEC within 40 (for accelerated filers) or 45 days (for all other registrants) after fiscal quarter-end, according to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The form 8-K is a report that all public firms must file to the SEC to notify investors about material events or changes in the company, where each type of event is classified as an \textit{8-K item}. \hyperref[appd]{Appendix D} provides a list of 8-K items. The 8-K items are listed in two distinct formats before and after August 23 of 2004 because on that date the SEC adopted an 8-K reform, which made three amendments to prior 8-K guidance: expanding the scope of the events subject to Form 8-K disclosure, creating a new topical format, and shortening the filing deadline \cite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004, lermanNewForm8K2010}. All 8-K items except the Other Events, the Regulation FD Disclosure and the Results of Operations and Financial Condition are mandatory items.\footnote{We follow \citeA{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020} and classify the Results of Operations and Financial Condition and the Regulation FD Disclosure as voluntary disclosure items, because the triggering event of these two items is the firm's voluntary disclosure of material events. \citeA{lermanNewForm8K2010} classify the two items as ``semi-voluntary" based on the same reason. The Other Events is voluntary following the filing requirement in \citeA{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}. } For mandatory items, 8-K filings must be filed upon the occurrence of any one or more events pertaining to the mandatory 8-K items, within a specific filing deadline. The filing deadline for nonvoluntary items was five through fifteen days after the occurrence of the event in the late 1980s, and was shortened to four business days following the occurrence of the event after August 23 of 2004 \cite{lermanNewForm8K2010}.

% 10-Q and 8-K comparing to other disclosure channels
Firms can issue narrative disclosures via multiple channels, such as social media and press, conference calls and annual reports etc. We focus on 10-Q and 8-K filings in this study for three motives. First, 10-Q and 8-K are both firm-issued filings that are mandatory for all public companies. Their content is under SEC scrutiny and biased reporting increases litigation risk \fullcite{rogersDisclosureToneShareholder2011, cazierWhenAreFirms2020}. Therefore, 10-Q and 8-K filings provide higher credibility comparing to firm-issued disclosures via social media and press. Second, 10-Q and 8-K filings are highly scripted and have higher reporting threshold comparing to conference calls, meaning that corporate events need to have a moderate impact on firm operations to be discussed in 10-Q and 8-K filings \fullcite{hassanFirmLevelPoliticalRisk2019}. Thus, we filter out less relevant events and concentrate on the ones with material impact by using 10-Q and 8-K reports. Third, 10-Q and 8-K filings are timelier than 10-K filings, i.e., annual reports. Using 10-K filings, managers can only bundle information acquired during the whole fiscal year and make summarized responses to all events in one single report at year-end. Given that one of our goals is to examine the timeliness of narrative disclosures, 10-K filings cannot provide sufficient time variation in good and bad news responses, and thus they are not appropriate text source for the purpose of this study.

% Advantage and disadvantage of 10-Q and 8-K?
There is heterogeneity between 10-Q and 8-K filings as well. First, 10-Q filings provide more variation and diversity in content than 8-K filings. 10-Q filings contain sections such as notes to financial statements and MD\&A, where managers can discuss the economic implications of significant corporate events and issue forward-looking statements, while 8-K filings only offer descriptive texts of events in standardized format. Moreover, 8-K filings are shorter, i.e. contain fewer words than 10-Q filings on average. These features imply that 10-Q filings are more flexible in content, in the sense that managers have more discretion on what and how to disclose in 10-Q filings, which provides us with more variation in linguistic tone than 8-K filings. Thus, our analyses and conclusions regarding linguistic tone are mainly conducted on and drawn upon 10-Q sample. 

Second, 10-Q filings are not as timely as 8-K filings. 10-Q filings are filed once every quarter, so regardless of managerial reporting incentive, 10-Q filings cannot be as timely as 8-K filings in responding to unexpected corporate events, especially for those events that happen during early days in a fiscal quarter. This is testified by the following excerpt extracted from SEC's announcement of the 8-K reform in 2004:

\begin{singlespace}
	\indent \textit{Under the previous Form 8-K regime, companies were required to report very few significant corporate events. The limited number of Form 8-K disclosure items permitted a public company to delay disclosure of many significant events until the due date for its next periodic report. During such a delay, the market was unable to assimilate such undisclosed information into the value of a company's securities. The revisions that we adopt today will benefit markets by increasing the number of unquestionably or presumptively material events that must be disclosed currently. They will also provide investors with better and more timely disclosure of important corporate events.}
	\begin{flushright}
		\cite<Final Rule: Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of Filing Date,>[]{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}
	\end{flushright}
\end{singlespace}

Furthermore, besides narrative disclosure, 10-Q filings also contain quarterly financial statements, so the reporting time lag of 10-Q does not strictly measure the timeliness of narrative disclosure solely, but the timeliness of recognition and disclosure in aggregation. Considering these features, our analyses and conclusions regarding timeliness are mainly conducted on and drawn upon 8-K sample.

% News measure and why stock returns
Following \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}, we measure good and bad news with stock returns. This proxy is valid under the assumption of market efficiency. In efficient market, stock returns incorporate public and private information in a timely manner and therefore the positive and negative returns are indicative of good and bad news of firms. %[cite and development needed]
Firms respond to news by disclosing detailed information of the events that cause changes in stock returns via 10-Q or 8-K filings.\footnote{We use stock returns measured at date \textit{prior or equal to} the 10-Q and 8-K report filing date to classify the underlying corporate events as good or bad news. 
%This empirical design ensures that any changes in stock returns are not caused by the filing of corporate report, but by other corporate events that happen before the report filing date. 
However, we do not require that the filing of report is caused by the change in market returns or vice versa. In fact, our dataset contains both cases. The core assumption here is that the SEC filings and the market returns movements are related to the same corporate event, which enables us to distinguish the nature of the event and investigate how narrative disclosure responds to such event.}

\subsection{Model Specification}
\subsubsection{Form 10-Q}
10-Q filings are quarterly reports that are filed to SEC within 40 or 45 days after fiscal quarter-end. Given their stable periodicity, we design the following model to explore how 10-Q filings behave when firms face good versus bad news. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
TEX_{i,t}=\beta_0+\beta_1QRET_{i,t}+\beta_2NEG_{i,t}+\beta_3QRET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}+\beta_nCONTROLS_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}

In Equation (1), QRET denotes the quarterly market-adjusted stock returns. NEG is an indicator for bad news, which is set to 1 if QRET is negative and 0 otherwise. CONTROLS represents a vector of control variables, which includes firm size (SIZE), market-to-book ratio (MTB) and leverage ratio (LEV) (see \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C} for detailed variable definition). We control for these three firm characteristics to alleviate the omitted variable bias, as these three factors can affect stock returns and firm narrative disclosure simultaneously \fullcite{liInformationContentForwardLooking2010, huangToneManagement2014}. %[specific explanation on each of the controls and cite needed]
Notice that the right-hand side of Equation (1) resembles the conditional conservatism model in \citeA{basuConservatismPrincipleAsymmetric1997}. Our model differs from the Basu model in replacing earnings with three textual variables to examine the responses of narrative disclosures to positive versus negative market returns. Specifically, TEX represents a vector of textual properties that consists of number of words (NW), tone (TONE) and reporting time lag (TLAG). NW is calculated as the natural logarithm of one plus the count of total words. TONE is defined as number of net positive words per thousand total words, and is calculated as total number of positive words minus the sum of total number of negative words and total number of negations, and multiply the previous result by one thousand for ease of interpretation. We follow \citeA{loughranWhenLiabilityNot2011} and count negations as cases where negation words\footnote{Negation words include: no, not, none, neither, never, nobody \fullcite{tottieNegationEnglishSpeech1991}.} occur within four or fewer words from a positive word. By taking negations of positive words into consideration in calculating tone, we control for the fact that it is common for firms to frame bad news using negated positive words, i.e., use ``did not increase" instead of ``decrease". We do not control for negations of negative words because firms rarely communicate good news with negated negative words, i.e, use ``did not fail" instead of ``succeeded". TLAG is defined as number of days elapsed between the news release date and document filing date in EDGAR. One concern of the TLAG measurement for reporting timeliness is that the length of reporting time lag may not be fully controlled by firms, and thus cannot accurately capture the discretionary reporting timeliness of firms, because prior auditing literature suggests that a set of auditor characteristics contributes to unexpected audit report lag \fullcite{knechelAdditionalEvidenceAudit2001, bamberAuditStructureOther1993}, which consequently leads to filing delay in audited financial reports. However, because audit for quarterly filings is not mandated by law, and due to the expensive auditing cost, most 10-Q filings are not audited.

The coefficient of interest in Equation (1) is $\beta_3$, which is interpreted as the difference in responsiveness of textual properties to good versus bad news. If 10-Q narrative disclosure is conservative, we expect it to be lengthier, more news-consistent and timelier when firms receive bad news. In the case of NW being the dependent variable, $\beta_3^{NW}$ should be negative under H1, because QRET is always negative when NEG equals 1, and therefore the product of the interactive term $\beta_3^{NW}QRET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}$ is positive, which translate into increased document length in terms of number of words. Following the same logic, $\beta_3^{TLAG}$ of TLAG regression should be positive under H3, which translates into shorter reporting time lag. The interpretation of $\beta_3^{TONE}$ is different from those of the previous two estimations, in the sense that $\beta_3^{TONE}$ represents the difference in marginal change of tone in response to good versus bad news. An incremental marginal change of tone in response to bad news, reflected as positive $\beta_3^{TONE}$, means that on average, the tone is more negative in response to bad news than it is positive in response to good news, given the same magnitude of news impact.

Additionally, we construct an abnormal tone measure (ABTONE) following the expected tone model in \citeA{huangToneManagement2014}. ABTONE is calculated as the residual of the following model:\footnote{Our expected tone model differs from \citeA{huangToneManagement2014} in replacing book-to-market ratio with market-to-book ratio.}
\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
\begin{split}
TONE_{i,t}=\beta_0&+\beta_1EARN_{i,t}+\beta_2RET_{i,t}+\beta_3SIZE_{i,t}+\beta_4MTB_{i,t}+\beta_5STD\_EARN_{i,t}\\
&+\beta_6STD\_RET_{i,t}+\beta_7AGE_{i,t}+\beta_8BUSSEG_{i,t}+\beta_9GEOSEG_{i,t}+\beta_{10}LOSS_{i,t}\\
&+\beta_{11}\Delta EARN_{i,t}+\beta_{12}AFE_{i,t}+\beta_{13}AF_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where TONE is the number of net positive words per thousand total words. Other financial variables are defined in \hyperref[appc]{Appendix C}. As residuals of Equation (2), ABTONE captures the portion in tone that is orthogonal to firm fundamentals such as business complexity, growth opportunities and risk, and represents the portion subject to managerial discretion. Our regression result of the expected tone model is consistent with \citeA{huangToneManagement2014}.\footnote{See results comparison for expected tone model in \hyperref[oat1]{Table 1 of Online Appendix}.}

\subsubsection{Form 8-K}
%%%% 8-K filing data structure
Due to the irregularity of 8-K triggering events, 8-K filings in EDGAR database have a unique data structure: though most companies only report one 8-K filing in one day and each 8-K filing usually contains only one or two 8-K items, some firms report more than one 8-K filings per day and each 8-K filing may contain more than two items. So we construct 8-K sample in three steps. First, as we want to analyze the responsiveness of 8-K filings to good and bad news, and our news proxy---daily stock return is at firm-day level, we aggregate the raw 8-K data at individual event level into 8-K data at firm-day level by summing up all raw count variables over each firm-day. For instance, the count variable $nw_{i,t}$ in 8-K dataset stands for number of total words in all 8-K filings reported in day \textit{t} for firm \textit{i}, instead of number of total words of one specific 8-K filing. To keep track of the unique data structure of 8-K filings, we further construct two new variables---N8K and NITEM, which are defined as number of 8-K filings reported in one day and number of 8-K items reported in one day, respectively. We label a firm-day as “8-K day” if there is at least one 8-K filing reported in that day.

%%%% 8-K news proxy
Next, we build our proxy for news under 8-K context. We obtain the daily market-adjusted stock returns (DRET) based on raw data from CRSP and calculate the change in daily returns ($\Delta$DRET). Then, we define a firm-day as a “bad (good) news day” if the negative (positive) change in daily market-adjusted stock return ($\Delta$DRET) is three times larger than the firm's average decrease (increase) in daily return over the calendar year. BN is an indicator for bad news day, which is set to 1 if this firm-day is a bad news day, and 0 if this firm-day is a good news day.\footnote{We code BN to missing if the firm-day does not have any news. Therefore, in our final 8-K sample for regression analysis, all observations are either good or bad news firm-days.} Notice that we define good and bad news differently under 8-K and 10-Q context. This is because that daily returns are more volatile than quarterly returns and the sign of daily returns can change constantly merely due to trading noises. Therefore, we only focus on firm-days with sizable changes in daily returns (three times than annual average), which is more likely to result from significant corporate events and is more likely to reflect fundamental information about the firm.

%%%% 8-K event matching process
At last, we conduct a matching process as illustrated in \hyperref[fig1]{Figure 1}. The idea of matching is to pair the news releases to firms' responses in form of 8-K filings to the precedent news. Specifically, we match every news day to its first subsequent 8-K day, ignoring the successive 8-K days (if any) between two news days (Match-1), or in some cases the 8-K day coincides with news day (Match-2). After matching, we calculate TLAG of 8-K sample as the number of days elapsed between the news release date and document filing date.\footnote{All filings in EDGAR have two dates: filing date and reporting period date. Filing date is the date when the document is filed to EDGAR, and reporting period date is the end date of reporting period of the filing. We match by 8-K \textit{reporting period date} because we want to make sure that the 8-K filings reported at a specific date are indeed responses to the news released just before. However, we calculate TLAG using 8-K \textit{filing date} because we are interested in whether 8-K filings respond to good and bad news with different timeliness, allowing for managerial discretion in reporting speed.}

The underlying assumption behind this matching process is that the first 8-K issued after a news release is responding to that news. One concern of this assumption is that time sequence does not necessarily imply association---that is, the fact that some 8-K filings are reported after certain news does not guarantee that the 8-K filings are meant to address that news. We provide two validity checks for this assumption from different aspects. As a first check, we construct a \textit{restricted 8-K sample} by limiting the matched 8-K sample to observations with reporting time lag less than or equal to four (five) calendar days for observations with reporting period-end after (before) August 23 of 2004 (TLAG = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Because firms must file required current reports in Form 8-K within four (five) business days of a triggering event after (before) August 23 of 2004 \fullcite{secFinalRuleAdditional2004}, 8-K filings reported within four (five) days of news release are more likely to be related to the precedent news, as is regulated by the SEC rule. Our restricted sample selection criterion is more restrictive than the SEC rule for three reasons. First, while the regulation requires firms to file 8-K within four (five) business days of a triggering event, we reduce this reporting deadline to four (five) calendar days, which is always shorter or at most equal to four (five) business days. Second, the regulation exempts the voluntary disclosure items from the four (five) business day reporting deadline \cite{heMeasuringDisclosureUsing2020}, but we still apply this reporting deadline to these items. Third, prior to the 8-K reform, 8-Ks must be filed within five to fifteen days depending on the nature of the event occurred, but we uniformly apply the five days deadline to all items before the reform. This more stringent sample selection criterion further ensures that 8-K filings in our restricted sample are indeed responding to precedent news. Our main results of 8-K hold using both the full and restricted 8-K samples. As a second check, we conduct manual audit for ten matched 8-K cases with the largest positive and negative change in daily returns ($\Delta$DRET) respectively, and the results support the matching assumption. See \hyperref[appe]{Appendix E} for details of the manual audit process.

Once the 8-K sample is constructed, we design the following model to explore how 8-K filings behave when firms have good versus bad news.
\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
TEX_{i,t}=\beta_0+\beta_1\Delta DRET_{i,t-tlag}+\beta_2BN_{i,t-tlag}+\beta_3\Delta DRET_{i,t-tlag}\times BN_{i,t-tlag}+\beta_nCONTROLS_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}
Where $\Delta$DRET and BN are changes in daily returns and bad news indicator \textit{at news release date}. We deploy $\Delta$DRET rather than DRET in this model because under 8-K context, the bad news indicator BN is defined based on $\Delta$DRET, as opposed to DRET. In Equation (3), CONTROLS denotes a vector of control variables \textit{at 8-K filing date},\footnote{Because our measures of firm fundamentals are calculated based on Compustat quarterly data, the variation in firm fundamental measures is very small (if any) either we control for them at news release date (t-tlag) or at 8-K filing date (t), as the average reporting time lag of 8-K is only 23 days.} which includes firm size (SIZE), market-to-book ratio (MTB) and leverage ratio (LEV). We control for these three fundamental characteristics that may affect firms reporting policy to address the omitted variable bias. TEX represents a vector of textual properties that consists of number of words (NW), tone (TONE) and reporting time lag (TLAG), which share the same definition as in 10-Q context. The coefficient of interest in Equation 3 is still $\beta_3$, and its interpretation is the same as that in the context of 10-Q. If 8-K narrative disclosure is conservative, we expect it to be lengthier, more news-consistent and timelier when firms respond to bad news, which manifests as negative $\beta_3^{NW}$, positive  $\beta_3^{TONE}$ and positive $\beta_3^{TLAG}$.

\subsection{Data}
We obtain historical financial and segment data from Compustat, stock returns from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and analyst earnings forecasts data from I/B/E/S. We retrieve 10-Q and 8-K data from EDGAR through a self-developed Python program (see \hyperref[appa]{Appendix A} for detailed description of EDGAR data collection process). \hyperref[T1]{Table 1} illustrates the sample selection process of 10-Q and 8-K filings. First, we successfully parsed and retrieved 575,579 (1,489,626) unique 10-Q (8-K) filings out of 594,017 (1,628,467) existing filings in EDGAR from 1993-Q1 to 2020-Q1. Next, we merge 10-Q and 8-K dataset with other datasets of firm characteristics and market performance. Finally, we screen the merged 10-Q and 8-K dataset according to the following criteria. We eliminate observations with missing value in key accounting and financial variables or with beginning-of-quarter stock prices below \$1. In 10-Q sample, we further delete observations with missing values in analyst coverage variables. We exclude financial (SIC code between 6000 and 6999) and utility (SIC code between 4900 and 4999) firms because the accounting policy for the former is different from that of other industries, and they are both highly regulated industries which are incomparable to other industries in general. Observations with non-positive total assets or book value of equity, or with negative or above 99\% percentile reporting time lag (TLAG),\footnote{Before truncation, the average reporting time lag for 10-Q is 40 days, but the maximum lag is 4,069 days, which is filed by CPI Corp in 2007-06-21 to report a quarterly result as of 1996-04-27 (see \url{https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/containers/fix041/25354/0001140361-07-012753.txt}). We read some of the 10-Q filings with such extremely long reporting lag but do not find an explanation for the unusual delay. In theory 10-Q filings should be filed within 40 or 45 days after fiscal quarter-end, so it remains a puzzle as to why in practice there exists a few accepted filings with such a big delay in EDGAR database. For the purpose of this study we eliminate observations with unusual delay. We also truncate TLAG at 99\% percentile in 8-K sample.} or with below 1\% percentile total number of words (nw) are dropped. All financial variables except returns are winsorized at 1\% and 99\% level to minimize the impact of outliers. Our final 10-Q sample contains 91,606 firm-quarter observations which constitutes of observations from 5,250 unique firms from 1993 to 2016. Final 8-K sample contains 244,401 firm-day observations which constitutes of observations from 8,876 unique firms from 1993 to 2019. On average, each firm in 8-K sample has four significant news event days in a year. Sample size can vary across different model specifications and is stated in each table. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Summary Statistics}
\hyperref[T2PA]{Table 2 Panel A} presents summary statistics for key variables in 10-Q sample. The summary statistics of raw word count for positive, negative, uncertainty, litigation and modal words in 10-Q narratives (untabulated) are consistent with LM 10-Q dataset.\footnote{Bill McDonald and Tim Loughran created a dataset containing summary data for each individual 10-X (e.g., 10-K, 10-K/A, 10-Q405, etc.) filing, available at \url{https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/\#LM_10X_Summaries}.} On average, each 10-Q filing contains 10,215 words, with considerable variation across filings. TONE is negative in general and we propose two possible explanations for this. First, the LM sentiment word list contains more negative (2,355) than positive (354) words by construction, so the likelihood of words being classified as negative is higher than that of positive words. Second, since optimistic language increases litigation risk \cite{rogersDisclosureToneShareholder2011, cazierWhenAreFirms2020}, firms may avoid positive words in 10-Q filings to reduce litigation risk. On average, 10-Qs are filed 39 days after fiscal quarter-end, and 75\% of 10-Qs are filed within 44 days after fiscal quarter-end, which are one day before the filing deadline for accelerated filers and all other filers, respectively. This shows that firms do have discretion in reporting timeliness. ABTONE is normally distributed around zero by construction, and its quantiles are consistent with \citeA{huangToneManagement2014}. Since all financial variables but QRET are winsorized, QRET contains some extremely high and low values. Our main results of 10-Q sustain if we winsorize QRET.

\hyperref[T2PB]{Table 2 Panel B} presents summary statistics for key variables in 8-K sample. 8-K filings are more neutral in terms of tone comparing to 10-Q filings, with average TONE being almost zero. Also, 8-K filings are more timely responses to news events, with average TLAG being 23 days, which is 16 days sooner than average 10-Q filings. In more than 75\% of our 8-K firm-day observations, there is only one reported 8-K filing per day, and the maximum number of 8-Ks a firm has reported in one day is five. On average, all reported 8-Ks in one day contains 1,258 words in total, which is significantly less than the number of words per 10-Q. Firms report two 8-K items per day on average, with the maximum number being sixteen. \hyperref[fig2]{Figure 2} illustrates the 8-K item distribution before (left) and after (right) August 23 of 2004. Each share of pie chart shows the percentage of corporate events reported under each 8-K items. The most commonly reported 8-K items before reform are Item 7: financial statements and exhibits (36.4\%), Item 5: other events (29.6\%) and Item 2: acquisition or disposition of assets (13.8\%), whereas after reform the most frequent ones are Item 9.01: financial statements and exhibits (37.7\%), Item 2.02: results of operations and financial condition (18.9\%) and Item 8.01: other events (9.4\%). Voluntary disclosure, which consists of the Item Results of Operations and Financial Condition, the Item Regulation FD Disclosure and the Item Other Events, makes up for 38.3\% (36.2\%) of total 8-K items before (after) the 8-K reform. This indicates that firms indeed use 8-K filings to report events that are not explicitly required but the firms consider important to the public. Consistent with \citeA{baoManagersDiscloseWithhold2019}, \hyperref[fig2]{Figure 2} further suggests that managers do have discretion in whether, when and how to communicate with investors via 8-K form, especially via the Item Other Events. Regarding the financial variables, all but DRET and $\Delta$DRET are winsorized, so these two variables contain some extremely high and low values. Our main results of 8-K sustain if we winsorize DRET and $\Delta$DRET.

\hyperref[T2PC]{Panel C} and \hyperref[T2PD]{Panel D} of Table 2 present correlation matrix of key variables in 10-Q and 8-K sample, respectively. In Panel C, the correlations between ABTONE and other financial variables are close to zero, which verifies that ABTONE captures the portion of discretionary tone that is orthogonal to firm fundamentals. 

\subsection{Is 10-Q narrative disclosure more responsive to bad news than good news?}
\hyperref[T3PA]{Table 3 Panel A} presents the regression result of \hyperref[eq1]{Equation 1}. Column 2, 4 and 6 include firm and time fixed effects to control for unobservable firm characteristics or time trends that may bias our estimation. Furthermore, given that reporting policy of firms within a same industry may be similar, which may lead to high correlations among observations in textual variables such as NW, TLAG and TONE, we cluster standard errors in Column 2, 4 and 6 at 4-digit SIC code industry level to correct the potential existence of serial correlation in dependent variables \fullcite{petersenEstimatingStandardErrors2009}. Our clustering approach yields 375 clusters in 10-Q sample (approximately 244 observations per cluster on average). As predicted by H1, the coefficient of QRET$\times$NEG is significantly negative for NW, consistent with 10-Q narratives being lengthier in response to bad news comparing to good news. Also, consistent with H2, the coefficient of QRET$\times$NEG is significantly positive for TONE, which suggests that the tone of 10-Q narratives are more consistent with news in response to bad news comparing to good news. However, in contrast to H3, the coefficient of QRET$\times$NEG is significantly negative for TLAG, which suggests that 10-Q reporting time lag is longer in response to bad news comparing to good news---that is, 10-Q filings respond to good news in a timelier manner than bad news. This delay in bad news response may appear because firms invest more resource and time on preparing the 10-Q filings to analyze and explain the causes of bad news. Due to the limitations discussed in \hyperref[sec3.1]{Section 3.1} about proxying timeliness of narrative disclosure with 10-Q reporting time lag, we interpret the TLAG result obtained in 10-Q sample only as supplemental evidence on timeliness of narrative disclosure.

In addition to the main hypotheses, we are interested in whether firms use different tone management strategy to influence investors' perception in response to good versus bad news. We replace the dependent variable in \hyperref[eq1]{Equation (1)} with the abnormal tone (ABTONE) proposed by \citeA{huangToneManagement2014}, and estimate the following model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq4}
ABTONE_{i,t}=\beta_0+\beta_1QRET_{i,t}+\beta_2NEG_{i,t}+\beta_3QRET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}+\beta_nCONTROLS_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}
Where ABTONE measures the discretionary portion of tone that is uncorrelated with firm fundamentals such as business complexity, growth opportunities and risk. Positive (negative) ABTONE indicates that the tone of 10-Q filing is more positive (negative) than it should be conditional on firm fundamentals. In Equation (4), positive $\beta_1$ can be obtained only when the signs of returns (QRET) and abnormal tone (ABTONE) agree, suggesting that managers deploy more positive (negative) tone than they should in 10-Q filings in response to good (bad) news. Vice versa, negative $\beta_1$ suggests that firms deploy more positive (negative) tone than they should in 10-Q filings in response to bad (good) news. The two phenomena are different forms of tone management, and we label the former with positive $\beta_1$ as \textit{tone emphasis} and the latter with negative $\beta_1$ as \textit{tone attenuation}. If none of the two types of tone management is present in 10-Q filings, then $\beta_1$ should not be significantly different from zero. The coefficient of interest is $\beta_3$, which represents the incremental tone emphasis or attenuation in response to bad news versus good news, depending on the sign of $\beta_3$. If narrative disclosure is conservative, we expect incremental tone emphasis for bad news, translating into positive $\beta_3$.

One key research design issue in estimating \hyperref[eq4]{Equation 4} is that the dependent variable ABTONE is calculated as residuals from \hyperref[eq2]{Equation 2}. \fullciteA{chenIncorrectInferencesWhen2018} point out that using residuals as dependent variables may lead to incorrect inferences, so we apply the following two remedies as suggested by the authors. First, we include all regressors in Equation 2 as control variables in Equation 4. Second, we combine all the regressors in Equation 2 and Equation 4 into one single-, as opposed to two-step regression, i.e. we estimate the following single-step regression:
\begin{equation} \label{eq5}
\begin{split}
TONE_{i,t}=\beta_0+\beta_1QRET_{i,t}+\beta_2NEG_{i,t}+\beta_3QRET_{i,t}\times NEG_{i,t}+\beta_nCONTROLS_{i,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where TONE is number of net positive words per thousand total words and CONTROLS denotes a vector of control variables including firm size (SIZE), market-to-book ratio (MTB), leverage ratio (LEV) and all regressors in \hyperref[eq2]{Equation 2}.

\hyperref[T3PB]{Table 3 Panel B} presents the regression results of Equation 4 (Column 1 and 2) and Equation 5 (Column 3 and 4). Column 2 and 4 include firm and time fixed effects and standard errors are clustered at industry level identified by 4-digit SIC codes. Regression results are very similar (if not identical) between Column 1 and 3 and Column 2 and 4. In both scenarios, $\beta_3$ is significantly positive, which suggests that firms tend to emphasize more the impact of bad news comparing to good news, potentially due to litigation pressure. Emphasizing bad news more than good news introduces a downward bias but provides warnings to financial information users, enhancing the stewardship role of financial reporting. The significance of $\beta_1$ confirms the existence of tone management in response to good news, although it is not clear whether the commonly applied strategy is tone emphasis or tone attenuation, as the sign of $\beta_1$ is indeterminate.

Overall, the results demonstrate that 10-Q filings are generally lengthier, more news-consistent and less timelier in response to bad news comparing to good news. In addition, 10-Q filings tend to emphasize more the impact of bad news in comparison with good news. 

\subsection{Is 8-K narrative disclosure more responsive to bad news than good news?}
\hyperref[T4PA]{Table 4 Panel A} presents the regression result of \hyperref[eq3]{Equation 3}. Column 2, 4 and 6 include firm and time fixed effects and standard errors are clustered at 4-digit SIC code industry level. Our clustering approach yields 383 clusters in 8-K sample (approximately 638 observations per cluster on average). As predicted by H1, the coefficient of $\Delta$DRET$\times$NEG is significantly negative for NW, consistent with 8-K narratives being lengthier in response to bad news comparing to good news. Also, consistent with H2, the coefficient of $\Delta$DRET$\times$NEG is significantly positive for TONE, which suggests that 8-K narratives are more consistent with news in response to bad news comparing to good news. Notice that due to the limitations discussed in \hyperref[sec3.1]{Section 3.1} regarding using 8-K corpora to study the linguistic tone, the tone results obtained in 8-K sample may serve only as supplemental evidence on the news-consistency of narrative disclosure. Finally, in line with H3, the coefficient of QRET$\times$NEG is significantly positive for TLAG, which suggests that 8-K reporting time lag is shorter in response to bad news comparing to good news---that is, 8-K filings respond to bad news in a timelier manner comparing to good news. We repeat the above main analyses using the restricted 8-K sample, and the results remain unchanged (see \hyperref[oat2]{Table 2 of Online Appendix}).

We perform three additional tests to assess the responsiveness of 8-K to good versus bad news, making use of the unique data structure of 8-K filings. First, we test whether firms report more 8-K items per day in response to bad news comparing to good news by replacing NITEM as the dependent variable in \hyperref[eq3]{Equation 3}. Second, we analyze whether firms are more likely to report more 8-K filings per day in response to bad news by estimating an ordered logistics version of \hyperref[eq3]{Equation 3} on N8K (N8K = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Last but not least, we examine whether firms are more likely to report more promptly via 8-K in response to bad news by estimating an ordered logistics version of \hyperref[eq3]{Equation 3} on TLAG using the restricted 8-K sample. If the 8-K narrative disclosure is conservative, we expect firm to report more 8-K items and 8-K filings per day in response to bad news comparing to good news, which is reflected as significantly negative $\beta_3^{NITEM}$ and $\beta_3^{N8K}$.\footnote{As $\Delta$DRET is always negative when BN equals to 1, a negative $\beta_3^{NITEM}$ makes the interaction term $\beta_3^{NITEM}$$\Delta$DRET$\times$BN positive, which translates into more 8-K items. Similar reasoning applies to the sign prediction for $\beta_3^{N8K}$ and $\beta_3^{TLAG}$.} Also, we expect 8-K filings to respond more promptly to bad news, which is reflected as significantly positive $\beta_3^{TLAG}$.

\hyperref[T4PB]{Table 4 Panel B} presents the regression results for three additional tests. Aligned with previous predictions, the coefficients of $\Delta DRET_{i,t-tlag}\times BN_{i,t-tlag}$ are significantly negative for NITEM and N8K, and is significantly positive for TLAG. Column 1 presents the result of NITEM using an ordinary least square (OLS) regression\footnote{We choose OLS model for NITEM because the value of NITEM ranges from 1 to 16, which creates too many cutoffs for the ordered logistic model.} with firm and time fixed effects and clustered standard errors at industry level identified by 4-digit SIC codes. The significantly positive coefficient (0.193) of $\Delta$DRET shows that for good news, the number of 8-K items reported is positively associated with the magnitude of change in stock returns. Furthermore, $\beta_3^{NITEM}$ suggests that controlling for the size of daily changes in stock returns, a negative change in returns leads to 0.263 more reported 8-K items than a positive change, which is equivalent to 12\% increase in average number of 8-K items reported. Column 2 and 3 present results of ordered logistics models for N8K and TLAG. The baseline group of N8K regression is 1. The significantly positive coefficient (0.835) of $\Delta$DRET shows that for good news, the likelihood of reporting more number of 8-K filings is positively associated with the magnitude of change in stock returns. Moreover, $\beta_3^{N8K}$ suggests that controlling for the size of daily changes in stock returns, a negative change in returns leads to a 0.905 increase in the log odds of reporting more number of 8-K filings than a positive change. The baseline group of TLAG regression using restricted 8-K sample is 0. Similarly, the significantly negative coefficient (-1.121) of $\Delta$DRET shows that for good news, the likelihood of reporting in more days (reporting time lag being longer) is negatively associated with the magnitude of change in stock returns. Also, $\beta_3^{TLAG}$ suggests that controlling for the size of daily changes in stock returns, a negative change in returns leads to a 1.915 decrease in the log odds of reporting time lag being longer than a positive change. 

Overall, the results demonstrate that 8-K filings are on average lengthier, more news-consistent and timelier in response to bad news comparing to good news. Moreover, firms are more likely to report larger number of 8-K items and 8-K filings per day in response to bad news comparing to good news. All results are consistent with 8-K narrative disclosure being conservative.
