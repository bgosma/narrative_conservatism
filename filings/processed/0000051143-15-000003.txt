Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:  

1. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The
financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the
company's management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only
of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the
company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
      
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets,
liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss)
that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake
in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be
different from these estimates. Refer to the company's 2014 Annual Report on
pages 68 to 71 for a discussion of the company's critical accounting estimates.
 
     
 On October 20, 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business and manufacturing
operations to GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The assets and liabilities of the
Microelectronics business are reported as held for sale at March 31, 2015. The
operating results of the Microelectronics business have been reported as
discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to
this presentation to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing
operations. Refer to Note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional
information on the transaction. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, the
company renamed its Systems & Technology segment to Systems Hardware. 
 
      
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full
year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction
with the company's 2014 Annual Report.
 
     
 Noncontrolling interest amounts in income of $1.2 million and $(0.5) million, net of tax, for
the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are included in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within the other (income) and expense
line item.
 
      
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows
may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.
Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. This is annotated where applicable.
  

 
2. Accounting Changes:  In April 2015, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which requires debt issuance
costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective January 1, 2016 with
early adoption permitted. The guidance is a change in financial statement
presentation only and will not have a material impact in the consolidated
financial results. At March 31, 2015, the company had approximately $80 million in debt issuance
costs included in investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position.
     In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the
recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue recognition will
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures
regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of
adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance
recognized at the date of initial application. The guidance is effective
January 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new guidance and the method of adoption.
       In April 2014, the FASB
issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting a discontinued
operation. Only disposals of a component that represents a strategic shift that
has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial
results is a discontinued operation. The guidance also requires expanded
disclosures about discontinued operations and disposals of a significant part
of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The
guidance was effective January 1, 2015. The impact to the company will be dependent
on any transaction that is within the scope of the new guidance.
       In July 2013, the FASB
issued guidance regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when
a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward
exists. Under certain circumstances, unrecognized tax benefits should be
presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset
for a net operating loss

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

carryforward, a similar tax
loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The guidance was effective January 1,
2014. The guidance was a change in financial statement presentation only and did
not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 
  In March 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on when foreign currency translation adjustments should be
released to net income. When a parent entity ceases to have a controlling
financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within
a foreign entity, the parent is required to release any related cumulative
translation adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation
adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer
results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign
entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The guidance was
effective January 1, 2014 and did not have a material impact in the
consolidated financial results.  
     In
February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability
arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of
the guidance is fixed at the reporting date. Examples include debt
arrangements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation matters. The
guidance requires an entity to measure such obligations as the sum of the
amount that the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement
among its co-obligors plus additional amounts the reporting entity expects to
pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance was effective January 1,
2014 and did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.
 
3. Financial Instruments:  
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
       Accounting guidance
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the company is required to
classify certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value
hierarchy:
 
·        
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at
the measurement date;
·        
Level 2—Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly; and
·         
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability. 
 
       The guidance requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost
and effort.
 
       When available, the
company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the
fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use
current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as
interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated
models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that
is significant to the valuation.
 
       The determination of
fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and
time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt
securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
 
       In determining the fair
value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation
adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies
described below for several parameters that market participants would consider
in determining fair value:
 
·        
Counterparty credit risk
adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the
actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap
market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
·        
Credit risk adjustments are
applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities
measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in
developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
 
        As an example, the
fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model
that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield
curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs
relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are
available for the full term of the derivative.
 

10



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

      
Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These assets include equity method investments that are recognized at fair
value at the measurement date to the extent that they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. Certain assets that are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.
These assets include available-for-sale equity investments that are deemed to
be other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary
impairment of a financial investment, fair value is measured using a model
described above.
 
       Non-financial assets
such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be
impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type
of asset. In the third quarter of 2014, the company recorded an impairment on
certain assets that were initially reported as held for sale at September 30,
2014. See note 9, “Acquisitions/Divestitures,” for additional information.
There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the three months
ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 
       Accounting guidance
permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and
firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other
accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied
the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities.
 
       The following tables
present the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2015 and December 31,
2014.

December 31, 2014 were $751 million and
     
$681 million, respectively.    
(4) The gross balances of derivative
liabilities contained within other accrued expenses and liabilities, and other
     
liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31,
2014 were $165 million and $31 
     
million, respectively.
(5) Available-for-sale securities with carrying values that approximate
fair value.
(6)
If derivative exposures covered by
a qualifying master netting agreement had been netted in the Consolidated 
    
Statement of Financial Position, the total derivative asset and liability
positions would have been reduced by $97 
    
million each.
 
       There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the quarter
ended March 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the company
transferred trading security investments valued at $74 million from Level 2 to
Level 1 due to the expiration of certain regulatory restrictions.
 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
 
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
 
Notes and other accounts receivable and
other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate
fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt
(excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities
with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in
the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.   
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
       Fair values are based on discounted future cash
flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with
similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At March 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated
fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at
fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be
classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

Long-Term Debt
 
       Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is
based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an
asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market
price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates
currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term
debt was $34,295 million and $35,073 million, and the estimated
fair value was $36,844 million and $37,524 million at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial
statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified
as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 
Debt and Marketable Equity Securities
 
        The company’s cash equivalents and current debt securities
are considered available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, which is not
materially different from carrying value, in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position. 
 
       The following tables summarize the company’s
noncurrent debt and marketable equity securities which are considered
available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

       During the
fourth quarter of 2014, the company acquired equity securities in conjunction
with the sale of the industry standard server business which are classified as
available-for-sale securities. Gross unrealized gains related to
available-for-sale securities of $26 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2015 were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.
 
       Based on an evaluation of available evidence as of March
31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the company believes that unrealized losses on
debt and available-for-sale equity investments were temporary and did not
represent a need for an other-than-temporary impairment.

during the period were as follows:

Derivative
Financial Instruments 
 
       The
company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender
and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the
company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and
client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and,
where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are
denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align
rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease
and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing
debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
       As a
result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk
that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy
of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial
institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The company’s established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions
include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually
assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that
exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the
company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty
reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty
default.
 
       The
company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its
major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold
or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair
values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be
fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings
received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a
liability position at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $10 million and
$21 million, respectively, for which no collateral was posted at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014.  Full collateralization of these agreements would be
required in the event that the company’s credit rating falls below investment
grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The
aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions as of March
31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $1,991 million and $1,432 million,
respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the
reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This
exposure was reduced by $141 million and $97 million at March 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting
arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at March 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, this exposure was reduced by $734 million and $487 million
of cash collateral, respectively, received by the company. At March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $1,070 million and $817
million, respectively.  At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net
exposure related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position was $40 million and $99 million, respectively. 

 
       In the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset
derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does
it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash
collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. No
amount was recognized in other receivables at March 31, 2015 or December 31,
2014 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in
accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral totaled $734
million and $487 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation,
and therefore reports it in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was rehypothecated at 

15



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. At March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, the company held $46 million and $31 million in non-cash
collateral in U.S. Treasury securities, respectively.  
 
       The
company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in
stockholders’ equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of
significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar.
These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to
liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon
maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the
underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an
ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by
de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the
liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may
utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the
de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity.
 
       In its
hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate
swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the underlying
exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
 
       A brief
description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
 
Fixed and
Variable Rate Borrowings
 
       The
company issues debt in the global capital markets, principally to fund its
financing lease and loan portfolios. Access to cost-effective financing can
result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these
mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate
swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt
(i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances
into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At March 31, 2015 and December
31, 2014, the total notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps was
$6.6 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining
maturity of these instruments at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was
approximately 7.8 years and 8.7 years, respectively. 
 
Forecasted
Debt Issuance
 
       The
company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To
manage this risk, the company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to
lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt
issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did
not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at
March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       At
March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, net gains of approximately $1 million
(before taxes) were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
in connection with cash flow hedges of the company’s borrowings. Within these
amounts, gains of less than $1 million are expected to be reclassified to net
income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact
against the underlying transactions.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term
Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
 
       A large
portion of the company’s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is
designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the
volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with
respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and
foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At March
31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments designated as net investment hedges was $4.2 billion and $2.2
billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these
instruments at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was approximately 0.2 years
for both periods.
 
Anticipated
Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
       The
company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party
vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services
among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In
anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility
of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange
forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are
accounted 

16



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length
of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in
future cash flows is four years. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the
total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of
forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $9.3 billion for both periods,
with a weighted-average remaining maturity of 0.7 years for both periods.
 
       At
March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in connection with cash flow hedges of
anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of
$972 million and net gains of $602 million (before taxes), respectively, in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Within these amounts, $921
million of gains and $572 million of gains, respectively, are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 
 
Foreign
Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
       The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert
fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in
the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for
as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has
hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately
seven years. At March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, no amounts were
outstanding under this program.
 
       At
March 31, 2015 and  December 31, 2014, in connection with cash flow hedges of
foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $2
million (before taxes)  in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Within these amounts, less than $1 million of losses are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting
economic impact against the underlying exposure.      
 
Subsidiary
Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
 
       The
company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its
subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash
flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign
exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign
currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets
and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally
less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of
the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in
other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March
31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative
instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $11.2 billion
and $13.1 billion, respectively. 
 
Equity Risk
Management
 
       The
company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and
in the company’s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to
employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation
obligations are recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Although not designated as
accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and
futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee
compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on
certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock,
and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in
economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.2 billion and $1.3
billion, respectively.
 
Other Risks
 
       The
company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with
various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share
or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair
value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as
derivatives outstanding at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
       The
company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due
under contractual terms. The company may utilize credit default swaps to
economically hedge its credit exposures. The swaps are recorded at fair value
with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at March 31, 2015 and December
31, 2014.
 

17



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

       The company is exposed to market volatility on
certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or forwards to
economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are recorded at fair
value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014,
the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of
investment securities was less than $0.1 billion for both periods.
 
       The
following tables provide a quantitative summary of the derivative and
non-derivative instrument-related risk management activity as of March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and
2014, respectively.

Net investment in sales-type and
direct financing leases relates principally to the company’s systems products
and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Net investment in
sales-type and direct financing leases includes unguaranteed residual values of
$649 million and $671 million at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned income of
$491 million and $517 million, and net of the
allowance for credit losses of $188 million and $165 million at those dates,
respectively. 
 
      
Commercial financing receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses of $13 million and $17 million at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively, relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), net of the allowance
for credit losses of $408 million and $396 million at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively, are loans that are provided primarily to
clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment
terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years.
 
      
Client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) financing contracts are
priced independently at competitive market rates. The company has a history of
enforcing the terms of these financing agreements.
 
      
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
nonrecourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $596 million and $642 million at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively.
 
      
The company did not have any financing receivables held for sale as of March
31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
 
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
 
       The following tables present financing receivables on a gross
basis, excluding the allowance for credit losses and residual value, by
portfolio segment and by class, excluding current commercial financing
receivables and other miscellaneous current financing receivables at March 31,
2015 and December 31, 2014. The company determines its allowance for
credit losses based on two portfolio segments: lease receivables and loan
receivables, and further segments the portfolio into two classes: major markets
and growth markets.

       When
determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an
individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the
company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an
estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts
in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. In
addition, the company records an unallocated reserve that is determined by
applying a reserve rate to its different portfolios, excluding accounts that
have been specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit  rating, probability
of default, term, characteristics (lease/loan) and loss history.

Credit Quality Indicators
 
       The company’s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating
agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers,
are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting
indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service
credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moody’s,
where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit
ratings.
 
       The following tables present the gross recorded investment for
each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are
considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade.
The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation actions that the
company may take to transfer credit risk to third parties.

5. Stock-Based
Compensation:
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair
value of the award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service
period. The following table presents total stock-based compensation cost
included in income from continuing operations.

        Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost
for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased $3 million compared to the
corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to increases related to
restricted stock units ($4 million) and performance share units ($1 million),
offset by a decrease in the company’s assumption of stock-based awards
previously issued by acquired entities ($2 million).
 
       The amount of
stock-based compensation cost included in the loss from discontinued
operations, net of tax, was immaterial in both periods.
 
       As of March
31, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $793 million related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately 2.5 years.
 
       There was no
significant capitalized stock-based compensation cost at March 31, 2015 and
2014.
 
6. Segments:  
The table on page 26 reflects the results of continuing operations of the
company’s segments consistent with the management and measurement system
utilized within the company. Performance measurement is based on pre-tax income
from continuing operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief
operating decision maker, both in evaluating the performance of, and in
allocating resources to, each of the segments.
 
       In January 2015, the company’s
business process outsourcing business, Global Process Services, which was
previously managed within Global Technology Services, was integrated into
Global Business Services, creating an end-to-end business transformation
capability for clients and to better leverage the company’s industry knowledge.
The following table reflects this reclassification for the prior-year period.

       In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Spain issued a ruling in
litigation involving IBM Spain’s defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution
(DC) plans. As a result of this ruling, the company recorded a pre-tax
retirement-related obligation of $148 million in 2014 ($55 million in the first
quarter of 2014) in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Constitutional Court denied IBM
Spain’s requested leave to appeal the decision. In March 2015, the National
Audience Court issued a ruling that, in part, required IBM to stop making DC contributions
and also ruled that the company should promptly reinstate the DB plan. As a
result of this ruling, in the first quarter of 2015, the company recorded an
additional pre-tax retirement obligation of $230 million in SG&A in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This obligation is reflected in
"Non-U.S. Plans - Multi-employer plans/other costs" in the table
above. See note 12, "Contingencies" for additional information. IBM
Spain has appealed that ruling.
 
       In 2015, the company expects to contribute to its
non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans approximately $600 million, which will be
mainly contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in the UK, Japan, the
Netherlands and Spain. This amount represents the legally mandated minimum
contribution. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first three
months of 2015 were $90 million.

9. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
 
Acquisitions: During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the company
completed two acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $47 million.   
The Software segment completed
acquisitions of two privately held businesses in the first quarter: AlchemyAPI,
Inc. (AlchemyAPI) and Blekko, Inc. (Blekko).

Each acquisition
further complemented and enhanced the company’s portfolio of product and
services offerings.  AlchemyAPI is a leading provider of scalable cognitive
computing application program interface (API) services and computing
applications. Blekko technology provides advanced Web-crawling, categorization
and intelligent filtering. Purchase price consideration for these acquisitions
as reflected in the table above, was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions
are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash
and cash equivalents. 
  
       The
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition
method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity was recorded at
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired businesses
and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify as an
amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life of the
identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 4.9 years. These
identified intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Goodwill of $36 million has been assigned to the Software segment.
It is expected that approximately 11 percent of the goodwill will be deductible
for tax purposes. 
 
        On
April 13, 2015, IBM announced a definitive agreement for the purchase of
Phytel. Phytel is a leading provider of integrated population health management
software that specializes in an engagement system that analyzes patient
behavior and activity and looks for optimal outcomes. The engagement platform
reminds patients about things such as appointments and prescription refills.
This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. 
 
       On April 13, 2015, IBM announced the acquisition of
Explorys. Explorys is a healthcare intelligence cloud company that has built
one of the largest clinical data sets in the world specializing in real time
data collection used to link healthcare data for analytics, both clinical and
financial. At the date of issuance of the financial statements, the initial
business combination accounting was not complete for this acquisition.
 
Divestitures: 
 
        Microelectronics – On October 20,
2014, IBM and GLOBALFOUNDRIES announced a definitive agreement in which
GLOBALFOUNDRIES will acquire the company’s Microelectronics business, including
existing semiconductor manufacturing assets and operations in East Fishkill, NY
and Essex Junction, VT. The commercial OEM business to be acquired by
GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes custom logic and specialty foundry, manufacturing and
related operations.
 
       The companies have also agreed to a
10-year exclusive manufacturing sourcing agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES
will provide server processor semiconductor technology for use in IBM Systems.
The agreement provides the company with capacity and market-based pricing for
current semiconductor nodes in production and progression to nodes in the
future for both development and production needs. As part of the transaction
agreement, the company will provide GLOBALFOUNDRIES with certain transition
services, including IT, supply chain, packaging and test services and lab
services. The initial term for these transition services is one to three years,
with GLOBALFOUNDRIES having the ability to renew. 
 

31



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

       The transaction will be completed as
soon as is practical, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements,
customary closing conditions and any other required approvals. The transaction
is expected to close in 2015.
 
       In the third quarter of 2014, the
company recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.7 billion related to the sale of the
Microelectronics disposal group, which was part of the Systems and Technology reportable segment. The
pre-tax charge reflected the fair value less the estimated cost of selling the
disposal group including an impairment to the semiconductor long-lived assets
of $2.4 billion, $1.5 billion representing the cash consideration expected to
be transferred to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and $0.8 billion of other related costs. The
asset impairment was reflected in property, plant and equipment, net and the
other costs of disposal were reflected in other accrued expenses and
liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position at March 31, 2015. These estimates may be adjusted, and the company
may incur additional charges prior to the closing of the transaction. All
assets and liabilities of the business are reported as held for sale at March
31, 2015. The cash consideration is expected to be transferred over three years
with $750 million transferred at the closing date. The actual net cash related
to the transaction will be adjusted by the amount of the working capital due
from GLOBALFOUNDRIES, estimated to be between $200 million and $250 million.
 
Reporting the related assets and liabilities
initially as held for sale at September 30, 2014 was based on meeting all of
the criteria for such reporting in the applicable accounting guidance. While
the company met certain criteria for held for sale reporting in prior periods,
it did not meet all of the criteria until September 30, 2014. In addition, at
September 30, 2014, the company concluded that the Microelectronics business
met the criteria for discontinued operations reporting. The disposal group
constitutes a component under accounting guidance. The continuing cash inflows
and outflows with the discontinued component are related to the manufacturing
sourcing arrangement and the transition, packaging and test services. These
cash flows are not direct cash flows as they are not significant and the
company will have no significant continuing involvement. 
 
Summarized financial information for
discontinued operations is shown below.

Industry
Standard Server – On January 23,
2014, IBM and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) announced a definitive
agreement in which Lenovo would acquire the company’s industry standard server
portfolio (System x) for an adjusted purchase price of $2.1 billion, consisting
of approximately $1.8 billion in cash, with the balance in Lenovo common stock.
The stock represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in Lenovo. The
company would sell to Lenovo its System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade
servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and
iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and maintenance
operations.
 

32



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

IBM and Lenovo have
entered into a strategic relationship which includes a global OEM and reseller
agreement for sales of IBM’s industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk
storage systems, tape storage systems, General Parallel File System software,
SmartCloud Entry offering, and elements of IBM’s system software, including
Systems Director and Platform Computing solutions. Effective with the initial
closing of the transaction, Lenovo has assumed related customer service and
maintenance operations. IBM will
continue to provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo’s behalf for an extended
period of time. In addition, as part of the transaction agreement, the company
will provide Lenovo with certain transition services, including IT and supply
chain services. The initial term for these transition services ranges from less
than one year to three years. Lenovo can renew certain services for an additional
year.
 
The initial closing
occurred on October 1, 2014. A subsequent closing occurred in most other
countries in which there was a large business footprint on December 31, 2014. The remaining countries closed on March 31,
2015. In line with these remaining countries closing and certain adjustments
made to the provisions recorded at the time the transaction closed in the
fourth quarter of 2014, an additional pre-tax gain of $16 million was recorded
in the first quarter of 2015.
 
Overall, the company continues to expect to
recognize a total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.5 billion, which does not include associated costs related to
transition and performance-based costs. Net of these charges, the pre-tax gain
is approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.1 billion was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2014. The balance of the gain is
expected to be recognized in 2019 upon conclusion of the maintenance agreement.  
 
Customer Care – On
September 10, 2013, IBM and SYNNEX announced a definitive agreement in which SYNNEX
would acquire the company’s worldwide customer care business process
outsourcing services business for $501 million, consisting of approximately
$430 million in cash, net of balance sheet adjustments, and $71 million in
SYNNEX common stock, which represented less than 5 percent equity ownership in
SYNNEX. As part of the transaction, SYNNEX entered into a multi-year agreement
with the company, and Concentrix, SYNNEX’s outsourcing business, has become an
IBM strategic business partner for global customer care business process
outsourcing services. 
 
The initial closing of the transaction was completed on
January 31, 2014, with subsequent closings occurring in 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company continued to work
toward resolution of the required final balance sheet adjustments. A charge in
the amount of $10 million was recorded to reflect the expected resolution. For
the full year of 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million
related to this transaction. 
 
Through the first
quarter of 2015, final resolution of the required final balance sheet
adjustments has not been concluded. As of March 31, 2015, the cumulative
pre-tax gain attributed to this transaction remains at $202 million. 
 
Retail Store Solutions – On April 17, 2012, the company announced
that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba TEC for the sale of its
Retail Store Solutions business. As part of the transaction, the company agreed
to transfer the maintenance business to Toshiba TEC within three years of the
original closing of the transaction.
 
In first quarter of 2015, the company completed
the fifth phase of the transfer of the maintenance workforce to Toshiba. A
subsequent wave closing is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of
2015. The parts and inventory transfer to Toshiba will commence in the second
quarter of 2015 and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2015.
The workforce transfer and an assessment of the ongoing contractual terms of
the transaction resulted in the recognition of pre-tax loss of $2 million in
the first quarter of 2015.
 
The company expects to close the final phase of
the divestiture in the third quarter of 2015. Overall, the company expects to
recognize a cumulative total pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $511
million of which $510 million has been recognized through March 31, 2015.    
 
Others – In the first quarter of 2015, the company completed the
divestiture of the Algorithmics Collateral Management suite of products to
Smartstream Inc. and the divestiture of the Commerce ILOG Supply Chain
Optimization Tools suite of products to Llamasoft, Inc.
 
The financial terms of each transaction
were not material.

* Other intangibles are primarily
acquired proprietary and nonproprietary business processes, methodologies and
systems.  
 
     The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased
$113 million during the first
quarter of 2015, primarily due to amortization, partially offset by intangible
asset additions resulting from capitalized software and acquisitions. The
aggregate intangible amortization expense was $298 million and $339 million for
the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, in the
first three months of 2015, the company retired $429 million of fully amortized
intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by this amount.  
 
     The amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be the following

 *       The portion of the company’s fixed-rate

Financial Position as an amount equal to the sum of the debt’s carrying value
plus a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the
hedged debt obligations attributable to movements in benchmark interest rates.
 
       The company’s indenture governing its debt
securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants
which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the
aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10 percent of the company’s
consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge
or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also
include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio,
which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross
default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 
       The company is in compliance with all of its
significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders.
The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of
default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain
events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to
which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.  
        Pre-swap annual contractual maturities of
long-term debt outstanding at March 31, 2015, are as follows:

12.  Contingencies:   As a company with a
substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries,
IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a
leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will
continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated
products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement
and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company
enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations,
lawsuits or otherwise. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and
scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions
involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters
related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and
employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit
plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability,
securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory
agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the
company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may
involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel
questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters
arise.
 
       The
company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities,
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were
not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
      
In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides
disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least
reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on
its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the
experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and
employee relations considerations.
 
      
With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any
material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court
rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With
respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings
discussed in this Note, the company is unable to provide estimates of
reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of
amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits,
investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company’s
experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable
and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators
of the company’s potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide
such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims,
suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the
procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel
legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information
important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and
proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to
recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or
range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and
status of 

37



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

settlement discussions, discovery,
procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information
pertinent to a particular matter.
 
       Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined
in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a
material effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the
timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such
remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies
may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and
circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional
factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is
possible that the company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the
resolution of one or more of these matters.
 
       The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.
 
      
The company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by the SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&T’s UNIX IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the company’s distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux
and the company has asserted counterclaims. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff
filed for bankruptcy protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed.
The court in another suit, the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., held a trial in
March 2010. The jury found that Novell is the owner of UNIX and UnixWare
copyrights; the judge subsequently ruled that SCO is obligated to recognize
Novell’s waiver of SCO’s claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX
license agreements. On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s ruling and denied SCO’s appeal of this matter. In
June 2013, the Federal Court in Utah granted SCO’s motion to reopen the SCO v.
IBM case, and proceedings have resumed in that case.      
 
 
On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on
behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one
another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social
service program processing in Indiana. The State terminated the contract,
claiming that IBM was in breach, and the State is seeking damages. IBM believes
the State’s claims against it are without merit and is seeking payment of
termination amounts specified in the contract. After six weeks of trial, on
July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the State’s
claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed
portions of the trial judge’s findings, found IBM in material breach, and
ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to determine the State's damages,
if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of
the trial court's award of damages to IBM. This matter remains pending in the
Indiana courts.
 
      
 On April 16, 2014, Iusacell SA de C.V.
(Iusacell) sued IBM, claiming that IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations that
induced Iusacell to enter into an agreement with IBM Mexico. Iusacell claims
damages for lost profits. Iusacell’s complaint relates to a contractual dispute
in Mexico, which is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding in Mexico
initiated by IBM Mexico against Iusacell for breach of the underlying
agreement.   On November 14, 2014, the District Court in the Southern
District of New York granted IBM's motion to stay Iusacell's action against the
company pending the arbitration in Mexico between Iusacell and IBM Mexico.
 
      
IBM United Kingdom Limited (IBM UK) initiated legal proceedings in May 2010
before the High Court in London against the IBM UK Pensions Trust (the UK
Trust) and two representative beneficiaries of the UK Trust membership. IBM UK
is seeking a declaration that it acted lawfully both in notifying the Trustee
of the UK Trust that it was closing its UK defined benefit plans to future
accruals for most participants and in implementing the company’s new retirement
policy. In April 2014, the High Court acknowledged that the changes made to its
UK defined benefit plans were within IBM’s discretion, but ruled that IBM
breached its implied duty of good faith both in implementing these changes and
in the manner in which it consulted with employees. Proceedings to determine
remedies were held in July 2014, and in February 2015 the High Court held that
for IBM to make changes to accruals under the plan would require a new
consultation of the participants, but other changes (including to early
retirement policy) would not require such consultation.  IBM intends to appeal
both the breach and remedies judgments. In addition, IBM UK is a defendant in
approximately 290 individual actions brought since early 2010 by participants
of the defined benefits plans who left IBM UK. These actions, which allege
constructive dismissal and age discrimination, are pending before the
Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK.
 
       On March 24, 2014, in a suit brought by local Works Councils, the
Supreme Court of Spain held that IBM Spain’s Defined Contribution (DC) Plan
implemented in 1993 based on the voluntary participation of its employees was
null and void. The Supreme Court also held that current employees could
reinstate their rights to a Defined Benefit (DB) Plan, although with an offset
for DC contributions paid to date. The Court held that IBM Spain did not
consult with the Works 

38



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

Councils in seeking to change
the pension scheme, and recommended that IBM Spain and the Works Councils
engage in discussions over how to carry out the offset. The Constitutional
Court denied IBM Spain’s requested leave to appeal the decision. In March 2015,
the National Audience Court ruled that the Works Council was not entitled to
dictate the means by which IBM should carry out the offset of DC contributions,
but also ruled that the Supreme Court's judgment could be executed without the
need for individual lawsuits by employees, rejecting the position that the
judgment was declaratory only. The National Audience Court also ruled that IBM
should stop making DC contributions, and that the company should promptly
reinstate the DB Plan. IBM Spain has appealed that ruling and is reexamining
its business model as it prepares to reinstitute an outdated pension plan that
employees elected to forego 20 years ago, which benefits a limited subset of
the overall population of employees in Spain.
 
       In March 2011, the company announced that it had
agreed to settle a civil enforcement action with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) relating to alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977. On July 25, 2013, the court approved that 2011
settlement and required that for a two-year period IBM make reports to the SEC
and the court on certain matters, including those relating to compliance with
the FCPA. In early 2012, IBM notified the SEC of an investigation by the Polish
Central Anti-Corruption Bureau involving allegations of illegal activity by a
former IBM Poland employee in connection with sales to the Polish government.
IBM is cooperating with the SEC and Polish authorities in this matter. In April
2013, IBM learned that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is also investigating allegations related to the Poland matter, as well as
allegations relating to transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. The
DOJ is also seeking information regarding the company's global FCPA compliance
program and its public sector business. The company is cooperating with the DOJ
in this matter.
 
In March 2015, putative class action litigation
was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York related to the company's October 2014 announcement that it was
divesting its global commercial semiconductor technology business. The company
and three of its officers are named as defendants. Plaintiffs allege that
defendants violated Sections 20(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. 
 
       The
company is a defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the
Supreme Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of
hundreds of plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of
action, including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and
trespass. Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and
claim damages in unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and
property damages allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater
contamination and vapor intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures
in which plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly
resulting from the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at
its former manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints
also seek punitive damages in an unspecified amount. 
 
      
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
       The company is also
subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various
jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil,
the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities
regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The
total potential amount related to these matters for all applicable years is
approximately $525 million. The company believes it will prevail on these
matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.
 
13. Commitments:  The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities
include unused amounts of $5,712 million and $5,365 million at March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available
to the company’s business partners to support their working capital needs. In
addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients
in connection with client purchase agreements for approximately $1,634 million
and $1,816 million at March 31, 2015  and December 31, 2014, respectively.
 
       The company has applied the
guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if
the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The
following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the
guarantor.
 

39



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (continued)

       The company is a party to a variety
of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other
party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in
the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company
customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a
breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the
assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified environmental
matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and
certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is
conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures
specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow
the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the company’s
payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in
terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
       It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements
due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on
the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
       In addition, the company guarantees
certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment
under these financial guarantees was $40 million and $46 million at March 31,
2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material.

14. Subsequent
Events: On April 28, 2015, the company announced that the Board of
Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per common share. The dividend
is payable June 10, 2015 to shareholders of record on May 8, 2015. The dividend
declaration represents an increase of $0.20 per common share, which is 18
percent higher than the prior quarterly dividend of $1.10 per common share.

Organization of Information:
 
       In October 2014, the company announced a
definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business. The assets and
liabilities of the Microelectronics business are reported as held for sale at
December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015. The operating results of the
Microelectronics business are reported as discontinued operations. Prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion, where applicable,
to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations. In addition, in
the first quarter of 2015, the company renamed its Systems & Technology
segment to Systems Hardware.
 
Currency:
 
       The
references to "adjusted for currency" or "at constant
currency" in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts
that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Certain
financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that
translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior
year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries
where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information
is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact
of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of business performance. See “Currency Rate
Fluctuations” on page 62 for additional information.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

Divestitures:
 
       In September
2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with
SYNNEX for the sale of its customer care process outsourcing business, and in
January 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement
with Lenovo for the sale of its industry standard server business (System x).
These transactions closed in 2014. The company presents certain financial
results in the Management Discussion excluding the effects of the customer care
and/or the System x business divestitures. The company believes that presenting
financial information without either or both of these items is more
representative of operational performance and provides insights into, and
clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be
more useful to users of the financial statements. 
 
Operating
(non-GAAP) Earnings:
 
        In an effort to provide better transparency into the
operational results of the business, the company separates business results
into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing
operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain
acquisition-related charges, retirement-related costs, discontinued operations
and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings exclude the
amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring
and related expenses and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For
retirement-related costs, the company characterizes certain items as operating
and others as non-operating. The company includes defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan service cost, amortization of prior
service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings.
Non-operating retirement-related cost includes defined benefit plan and
nonpension postretirement benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan
assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan
curtailments/settlements and multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency
costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related
to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial
market performance and the company considers these costs to be outside the
operational performance of the business.
 
       Overall, the company believes that providing investors
with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased
transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and
the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to
management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables
better comparisons to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a
long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The company’s
reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from continuing
operations, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system.

Financial
Performance Summary:
 
       In the
first quarter of 2015, the company delivered $19.6 billion in revenue, $2.4
billion in income from continuing operations and $2.9 billion in operating
(non-GAAP) earnings resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $2.44 as reported and $2.91 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The
results of continuing operations exclude a net loss from discontinued
operations of $0.1 billion in both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 related
to the expected divestiture of the Microelectronics business. On a consolidated
basis, net income in the first quarter of 2015 was $2.3 billion, with diluted
earnings per share of $2.35. The company generated $3.6 billion in cash from
operations and $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter enabling
shareholder returns of $2.3 billion in gross common stock repurchases and
dividends.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
  Total consolidated revenue decreased
11.9 percent as reported, but was flat year to year adjusted for divestitures
and currency in the first quarter of 2015; this represented a 2 point
sequential improvement in year-to-year performance from the third and fourth
quarters of 2014. Currency had an 8 point, or $1.7 billion impact on reported
revenue in the first quarter. Additionally, revenue was impacted by 4 points in
the first quarter as the company continued to shift its portfolio to higher
value and divest businesses that no longer fit its strategic portfolio.
Combined, the impact of currency and the divested businesses reduced the
reported revenue growth by 12 points. 
 
       In February 2015, the company met with investors to
describe how it’s transforming the business to areas with long-term value in
enterprise IT. The company has a core portfolio that is high value to its
clients and high value to the company, and it is essential to both. While the
market for these capabilities may not be growing, the company continues to
reinvent and innovate to deliver that value. The company also continues to
invest in its strategic imperatives ‒ solutions that address the
opportunities in data, cloud, social, mobile and security. These are high value
solutions. The company is able to grow the strategic imperatives at a rate
significantly faster than the market because its offerings are highly
differentiated, and because the core businesses provide the industry
perspective and deep insight into how clients operate. 
 
       In the first quarter of 2015, strategic imperatives
revenue grew more than 20 percent as reported and more than 30 percent year to
year adjusted for currency and divestitures. Business analytics revenue
increased 12 percent as reported and more than 20 percent adjusted for currency
and divestitures. Social revenue increased 35 percent as reported and more than
40 percent adjusted for currency and divestitures, and mobile revenue grew more
than 4 times the prior year period. Cloud revenue was up over 60 percent as
reported and over 75 percent year to year in the first quarter adjusted for
currency and divestitures. On a trailing twelve month basis, cloud revenue was
$7.7 billion, demonstrating the high growth in the higher value cloud
opportunities across public, private and hybrid. The company had strong
performance in its cloud foundational and as-a-service offerings and exited the
quarter with an annual as-a-service run rate of $3.8 billion, an increase of
approximately $1.5 billion from the prior year. The majority of that growth was
organic, the result of the company’s deep insights into how its clients run
their business. In February 2015, the company announced a program to make
hybrid cloud a reality for the enterprise‒extending clients’ control,
visibility, security and governance in a hybrid cloud environment‒similar
to what they have in their private cloud and existing IT systems.        
 
  While the company is investing and
driving growth in the strategic imperatives, it’s continuing to reinvent and
bring innovation to the core portfolio. For example, in the hardware business,
the company has continued to invest and innovate. This led to the introduction
of the z13 mainframe which is built for the mobile economy, and the roll out of
POWER8, optimized for data and cloud.  The company has also executed
divestitures in the hardware business. The company is now starting to see the
results of these actions. In March 2015, the first z13 system shipped and
first-quarter 2015 mainframe revenue more than doubled year to year with MIPS
shipments up 95 percent. Power Systems revenue returned to growth, at constant
currency, leveraging strong performance in the scale-out systems.  
 
       All of this is driving the shift to higher value,
resulting in a higher margin and supporting targeted investments.  In 2015, the
company is shifting $4 billion of spending to data, cloud and engagement to
extend its differentiation in the market. In April 2015, the company announced
two initiatives, Internet of Things (IoT) and Watson Health. These initiatives
will further strengthen its position as a high value innovation company
providing solutions at the intersection of business and IT. The first quarter
results reflect the transformation in the business, including:
 
·        Continued momentum in the strategic imperatives,
·        Strong growth in hardware resulting from continued
innovation,
·        Declines in the core portfolio consistent with the second
half of 2014,
·       Margin expansion driven by the shift to higher value, and
·       Continuing to shift investments and rebalancing resources
to address the best long-term opportunities in the market.
 
       From a segment perspective, Global Services revenue
declined 11.6 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency (9
points) and divestitures (1 point). Global Technology Services (GTS) declined
10.9 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (9 points) and
divestitures (1 point) primarily driven by the mix and timing of contracts from
the GTS Outsourcing backlog. Global Business Services (GBS) revenue decreased
13.0 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency (8 points) and
divestitures (1 point). Declines in the more traditional application areas,
particularly in North America, were partially offset by strong growth in the
strategic imperatives. Software revenue declined 8.2 percent (2 percent
adjusted for currency) reflecting a modest sequential improvement at constant
currency from the rate in the fourth quarter of 2015. Key branded middleware
returned to growth at constant currency led by growth in the
software-as-a-service offerings, which increased approximately 50 percent.
Systems Hardware revenue decreased 22.6 percent as reported, but 

43



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

increased 30 percent adjusted for the divested System x
business (49 points) and currency (4 points). Performance reflected the strong
start in the z13 product cycle and Power Systems revenue returning to growth
year to year at constant currency. 
 
  From a geographic perspective, revenue
in the major markets declined 10.7 percent as reported, but was flat year to
year adjusted for currency (8 points) and divestitures (3 points) with growth
in the U.S. and Japan on an adjusted basis. Growth markets revenue decreased
16.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for divestitures (9 points) and
currency (6 points) compared to the first quarter of 2014, with growth in
Brazil and India on an adjusted basis. The company had sequential improvement
year to year on an adjusted basis in both the major markets and the growth
markets. 
 
  The consolidated gross profit margin
of 48.2 percent improved 0.5 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP)
gross margin of 49.3 percent increased 0.8 points compared to the prior year
primarily driven by both portfolio actions and the strong growth in System z. 
 
  Total expense and other (income)
decreased 13.3 percent in the first quarter of 2015 versus the prior year.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 16.8 percent
compared to the prior year. The year-to-year drivers were approximately:

       The
reduction in expense was driven by a lower level of workforce rebalancing
charges (a decrease of $0.6 billion); the fact that the divested System x
business is no longer in the spending base; and currency impacts. These
benefits were partially offset by the impact of a divestiture gain ($0.1
billion) in the prior year and a current year charge for an additional pension
obligation in Spain ($0.2 billion year-to-year impact). The reduction in
operating (non-GAAP) expense was driven by the same factors, excluding the
Spain pension obligation which is not reflected in operating (non-GAAP)
expense. The company is continuing to shift resources and spending to areas
with the most opportunity and plans to shift $4 billion of spending across
expense, cost and capital, to its strategic imperatives in 2015. In the first
quarter of 2015, the company has been executing that plan and increased expense
in key areas including‒SoftLayer, Watson and Bluemix.
 
       Pre-tax
income from continuing operations decreased 5.7 percent and the pre-tax margin
was 15.3 percent, an increase of 1.0 points versus the first quarter of 2014.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was
19.5 percent, a decrease of 1.0 points versus the prior year. Income from
continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 4.6 percent and the net income
margin was 12.3 percent, an increase of 0.9 points versus the first quarter of
2014. Losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $0.1 billion in
both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net income of $2.3
billion decreased 2.4 percent year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income
from continuing operations increased 3.0 percent year to year and the operating
(non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations improved 2.7 points to
18.4 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.9
billion increased 3.6 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from
continuing operations of 14.8 percent increased 2.2 points. The operating
(non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the first quarter
of 2015 was 20.0 percent versus 20.5 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The
lower tax rates in the first quarter of 2015 benefited from a more favorable mix
of geographic income offset by a decrease in the utilization of foreign tax
credits.
 
    Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations of $2.44 increased 0.4 percent year to year. In the first
quarter of 2015, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of its common
stock. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.91 increased 8.6
percent versus the prior year driven primarily by margin expansion and the
impact of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of lower as-reported
revenue. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was ($0.09) in
the first quarter of 2015 compared to ($0.14) in the first quarter of 2014.
 
    At March 31, 2015, the company
continues to have the financial flexibility to support the business over the
long term. Cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $8.8 billion, an
increase of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2014. Key drivers in the
balance sheet and total cash flows were:
 

44



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

    Total
assets decreased $5.5 billion ($1.1 billion adjusted for currency) from
December 31, 2014 driven by:
 
    ·       
Decreases in total receivables ($5.3 billion)
and goodwill ($0.7 billion); partially offset by
 
    ·       
Increased prepaid expenses and sundry assets
($0.8 billion).
 
  Total liabilities decreased $5.8 billion ($2.3 billion
adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2014 driven by:
 
   ·   Decreases in
total debt ($2.0 billion), taxes ($1.5 billion), retirement-related liabilities
($1.1 billion) and compensation and benefits ($0.7 billion). 
 
  Total equity of $12.3 billion increased $0.3 billion from
December 31, 2014 as a result of:
 
   ·       Higher retained earnings ($1.2 billion) and higher common
stock ($0.3 billion); partially offset by
 
   ·       
Increased treasury stock ($1.3 billion).
 
       The company generated $3.6 billion in cash flow
provided by operating activities, an increase of $0.3 billion when compared to
the first quarter of 2014, driven primarily by a lower level of  income tax
payments ($1.2 billion) and improvements from inventory ($0.2 billion),
partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by receivables ($0.8 billion)
and higher performance-based compensation payments ($0.4 billion). Net cash
provided by investing activities of $0.6 billion was $0.5 billion higher than
the prior year, primarily due to higher cash sourced from non-operating finance
receivables ($1.0 billion), partially offset by a decrease in cash provided
from divestitures ($0.4 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $3.4
billion decreased $1.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2014, driven
primarily by a decrease in cash used for gross common stock repurchases ($7.0
billion), partially offset by  a reduction in cash sourced from net debt
transactions ($5.5 billion) driven by lower issuances in 2015.
 
       The company has been transforming the business and
continues to see evidence that the transformation is working. In April 2015,
the company disclosed that it is expecting GAAP earnings in the range of $14.17
to $14.92 and, it continues to expect operating (non-GAAP) earnings between
$15.75 and $16.50 per diluted share from continuing operations for 2015. The
company also stated that it continues to expect free cash flow in 2015 to be
flat compared to 2014.

Global Services
 
       In the first quarter of 2015, the Global Services
segments, GTS and GBS, delivered combined revenue of $12,204 million, a
decrease of 11.6 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency (9
points) and divestitures (1 point). This quarter, the company closed fifteen
deals greater than $100 million with about half for new clients, or new scope
with existing clients. This reflects the strength of the company’s offerings
and client’s confidence in its ability to manage the most critical assets in
their business. Pre-tax income in the first quarter decreased 19.4 percent and
the pre-tax margin decreased 1.2 points to 12.7 percent.

  Global
Technology Services revenue of $7,886 million decreased 10.9 percent as
reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency (9 points) and the System x
divestiture (1 point). Within GTS, outsourcing revenue of $4,219 million
decreased 12.1 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency. This
performance reflects the mix and timing of contracts coming from the backlog.
As expected, many of the larger contracts signed in the prior year did not
contribute to revenue in the first quarter. The company is continuing to see
clients sign large infrastructure outsourcing deals with embedded cloud and
mobile initiatives to create large-scale hybrid IT environments. The company is
the trusted partner for these core business transformations because of its global
capabilities and portfolio breadth. The Forrester Research Wave evaluation
recently cited the company as the leading supplier in the global infrastructure
outsourcing segment. Integrated Technology Services (ITS) revenue of $2,112
million decreased 9.3 percent and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Within ITS,
there was good growth at constant currency in cloud, security and business
resiliency, but overall revenue performance was impacted by a shift away from
lower-value services such as datacenter build-outs and OEM hardware
deployments. SoftLayer grew solid double digits this quarter on an adjusted
basis, improving sequentially and building on the expanded datacenter capacity.
The company continued its steady progress with the opening of new footprints in
Montreal, Sydney and Amsterdam this quarter. Clients are choosing SoftLayer as
the platform on which to integrate cloud initiatives with their core systems
into a unified hybrid IT model. Maintenance revenue of $1,554 million decreased
9.7 percent as reported, but was up 2 percent for the quarter adjusted for
currency (8 points) and the System x divestiture (4 points). This growth was
driven by Multivendor Support Services, which is the company’s third party
hardware maintenance offering. The continued growth of maintenance is another
demonstration of the strength of the company’s global reach and capabilities.
As organizations expand, they want a partner who has scale and can provide
global parts and support capabilities.
 
Global Business Services revenue of $4,318 million
decreased 13.0 percent and 4 percent adjusted for currency (8 points) and
divestitures (1 point) in the first quarter of 2015. Consulting and Systems
Integration revenue of $3,090 million declined 12.9 percent as reported and 5
percent adjusted for currency in the first quarter. GBS Outsourcing revenue of
$1,228 million decreased 13.2 percent and 1 percent adjusted for currency (8
points) and the divestitures (5 points). As announced last year, Global Process
Services, the company’s business process outsourcing business has now been
integrated into GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation
capability for clients and to better leverage the company’s industry knowledge.
In the first quarter, GBS had solid performance in many markets and solution
areas. On an adjusted basis, Japan has been consistently growing revenue and
expanding margin, with solid growth in consulting and application outsourcing.
In the first quarter, Europe returned to revenue growth on an adjusted basis. Across
all geographies, GBS continued to drive strong growth in the offerings that
address the strategic imperatives. On an adjusted basis, cloud solutions more
than tripled year to year, analytics grew double digits, and there was good
growth in mobile and social. The company is helping clients create new business
models and opportunities for client engagement. The challenge for GBS is North
America. While there is strong business growth in the strategic imperatives,
the company is dealing with a slowdown in some of the more traditional areas.
While GBS has some very positive elements in the U.S., its performance overall
in the country has had a significant impact on the segment due to its relative
size.

       The GTS gross profit margin of 37.4 percent
decreased 1.4 points in the first quarter of 2015 compared to prior year. In
the first quarter, pre-tax income decreased 18.2 percent to $994 million and
the pre-tax margin declined 1.1 points to 12.3 percent compared to the prior
year. The year-to-year decrease in margin was driven by a few elements.
Currency was the biggest impact to profit on a year-to-year basis, and
maintenance profit was down due to the System x divestiture. Profit and margin
performance also reflect the continued investments in the business to expand
operational capabilities. The SoftLayer datacenter expansion is one example.
This gives the company a highly differentiated offering in hybrid cloud,
especially as it relates to data residency requirements. The company is also
increasing sales hiring in its mobile and security practices, and making
investments in its resiliency business. It is accelerating its transition to a
more significant global delivery model, which requires hiring and training
costs ahead of the expected savings. Finally, though there was a year-to-year
benefit from a smaller workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, the bulk of
the savings from the recent actions have not yet been realized.  
 
  The GBS gross profit margin of 27.4 percent decreased 1.8
points in the first quarter 2015 compared to prior year and pre-tax income
decreased 21.3 percent to $597 million. Pre-tax margin declined 1.4 points to
13.4 percent compared to the prior year with a mix of drivers. There was some
benefit from the lower workforce rebalancing charges this year and some savings
from the action taken in the prior year. There was an impact from the customer
care divestiture, both by the loss of operational profit and by not having the gain
in the current year results. The balance of the margin decline was driven by
the cost structure in those geographies where the company is not growing
revenue. The company is making investments and taking actions to make the cost
structure more competitive, including rebalancing to more global delivery, use
of alternate labor models, and shifting resources toward higher-value strategic
imperative offerings.
  
Global
Services Backlog
 
        The estimated Global Services backlog at March 31, 2015 was
$121 billion, a decrease of 12.3 percent (flat adjusted for currency) compared
to the March 31, 2014 balance. The
estimated transactional backlog at March 31, 2015 decreased 12.5 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency) from the March 31, 2014 levels. The estimated
outsourcing backlog decreased 11.7 percent as reported and increased 2 percent
adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.

Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
Global Services signings are management’s
initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a Global Services
contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the
calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates
and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type
and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or
wind-down costs.
 
Signings include GTS
Outsourcing, ITS, GBS Outsourcing and Consulting and Systems Integration
contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings
only to the extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in
signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues
equal renewals.
 
Contract portfolios purchased in an
acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those
contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing
will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or
coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

       Software revenue of $5,199 million
decreased 8.2 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of
2015 compared to the prior year. Adjusted for currency, year-to-year performance
reflected a modest sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. Middleware
decreased 7.0 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency), while operating
systems were down 15.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency). The decline
in operating systems impacted total software growth year to year at constant
currency by approximately 1 point. 
 
       Key branded middleware revenue
decreased 5.0 percent as reported and grew 1 percent adjusted for currency
compared to the prior year. While there were mixed results across the brands,
there was strong growth on an adjusted basis for currency across many solution
areas. Software-as-a-service offerings were up nearly 50 percent. Analytics
software was up, and mobile software grew at a strong double digit rate, led by
the MobileFirst offerings. There was solid growth in commerce solutions where a
large proportion of the business is software-as-a-service. Social solutions
grew double-digits at constant currency driven by strong performance in Kenexa
and advanced collaboration offerings.  
 
       Across software, the company
continues to drive innovation and capture growth areas, building its software
into broader solution capabilities. Recently, the company made two major announcements:
the Internet of Things (IoT) and Watson Health. These initiatives are a
continuation of what was started in 2014 with Watson and expanded earlier in
2015 with analytics, commerce and security. There are some common threads
throughout. They are all based on a unique point of view around cloud and the
value of hybrid. They all use analytics to leverage data and they all have an
industry dimension.  

49



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

 
       The company announced the IoT initiative
at the end of March, committing $3 billion of spending over the next four
years. As part of this initiative, a cloud-based open platform to help clients
and partners build and deliver vertical industry IoT solutions is being
established. The company has also created an IoT zone within Bluemix, its platform-as-a-service,
and is expanding an IoT ecosystem to leverage a growing developer and
entrepreneur community. This is similar to what has been done with Watson,
where there are not only large partners, but where there are also hundreds of
smaller, less known ecosystem partners, all of whom are building commercial
applications on Watson.
 
       Watson Health was announced in
April. The company believes it will transform healthcare by bringing together
the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson with a vast ecosystem of
partners, practitioners and researchers. There are several aspects to the
Watson Health announcement from the creation of a Watson Health Cloud, to partnerships
with leading companies and the acquisition of two companies that extend the
company’s healthcare analytics capabilities. 
 
       These are the two most recent examples
of where the company is partnering in new ways to drive innovation and build an
ecosystem to transform industries.

        In the first quarter of 2015,
Systems Hardware revenue of $1,659 million decreased 22.6 percent as reported
but grew 30 percent year to year adjusted for the divestiture of the System x
business (49 points) and currency (4 points) as the company continues to
deliver innovation across its high end systems.
 
        System z revenue increased
118.4 percent (130 percent adjusted for currency), compared to the prior year
period. MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments increased 95
percent year to year resulting in revenue more than doubling. Shipments of the
new z13 mainframe began in the second week of March and it was the fastest
start in number of systems shipped in over a decade. Additionally, the
year-to-year growth rate reported in the first quarter was the highest in any
quarter in more than a decade. The capabilities of the z13 mainframe around
data, mobile, cloud and real-time insights and fraud detection are resonating
well with customers. The new mainframe was built to handle workloads of the
future that are secure and available 100 percent of the time.

Management Discussion –

       Power
Systems revenue decreased 3.0 percent, but returned to growth of 1 percent
adjusted for currency, leveraging on strong performance in its scale-out
systems. In the quarter, the company not only gained share in the declining
Unix market, but it also expanded beyond Unix with Linux on Power and the
OpenPOWER IP opportunity. The company is expanding its customer base in
entry-level Linux systems as well as with large cloud-based customers. In
addition, just over a year ago, the OpenPOWER Foundation was launched to open
up the Power technology and build an ecosystem to share intellectual property.
The ecosystem of partners includes established companies such as Google, Nvidia,
Mellanox, Samsung, Tyan and Inspur. It also includes other smaller, emerging
companies adding breadth and reach. In March, the foundation unveiled more than
ten new hardware innovations that continue to make Power technology relevant
beyond the Unix market. Zoom Netcom, a data communication and equipment
supplier, will launch a system in the market later this year, which is based on
the first derivative of a POWER chip unveiled by Suzhou PowerCore. This
demonstrates that the company’s Power strategy is working and that there is
momentum in the business. 
 
 Storage
revenue decreased 7.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
quarter representing a modest year-to-year sequential improvement compared to
the fourth quarter of 2014. There was continued strong growth in FlashSystems.
However, this growth was offset by the wind down of the OEM business and
continued price weakness in high-end disk. The company sees the value in
storage shifting to software and, in the first quarter, it introduced IBM
Spectrum Storage, new storage software in support of hybrid cloud environments.
The portfolio provides greater access to data, accelerates speed to insights
and improves data economics.
 
Overall, the
Systems Hardware segment growth, on an adjusted basis, is a result of the
actions the company has taken to position its Systems business for the future.

       The Systems Hardware gross profit
margin of 44.5 percent increased 10.5 points in the first quarter of 2015
versus the prior year. The increase was due to mix (17.0 points) driven by the
strong growth in System z and the divestiture of the lower margin System x
business. This improvement was offset by a decrease due to margin (6.6 points),
with lower margins in System z (3.7 points), Power Systems (1.3 points) and
Storage (1.5 points). Systems Hardware pre-tax income was $24 million, an
increase of $481 million compared to the prior year, with a pre-tax margin of
1.4 percent, up 21 points year to year.

* Adjusted for divestitures and currency. 



 
       Total geographic revenue of $19,498 million
decreased 11.9 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency (8
points) and divestitures (4 points) in the first quarter of 2015 compared to
the prior year. Major market countries decreased 10.7 percent as reported and
were flat adjusted for currency (8 points) and divestitures (3 points). Growth
market countries decreased 16.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for
divestitures (9 points) and currency (6 points). On an adjusted basis, there
was sequential improvement in year-to-year performance in both the major
markets and the growth markets led by the U.S., Japan and Latin America. 
 
 In the growth markets, the year-to-year
performance adjusted for currency and the divestitures improved sequentially by
approximately 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2014. This performance was
driven by broad-based growth in Latin America which decreased 2.1 percent as
reported, but grew 14 percent adjusted for currency (12 points) and
divestitures (4 points). On an adjusted basis, there was also growth in the
Middle East and Africa region which decreased 6.6 percent as reported, but grew
4 percent adjusted for divestitures (9 points) and currency (2 points). Within
the BRIC countries, combined revenue decreased 20.7 percent as reported and 3
percent adjusted for divestitures (12 points) and currency (5 points). On an
adjusted basis, this represented sequential improvement compared to
year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, this overall growth
rate was not reflective of the individual country performance. On an adjusted
basis, growth in Brazil and India was offset by declines in Russia and China.
While the company has a profitable business in China and it continues to have
strong growth in mainframes, services revenue declined as the company shifts
its focus away from some of the lower margin offerings. 
 
      
Americas revenue of $9,312 million decreased 3.0 percent as reported and grew 2
percent adjusted for divestitures (3 points) and currency (3 points) compared
to the first quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, there was growth in both
the major markets and Latin American growth markets. North America declined 3.1
percent as reported and grew 1 percent adjusted for divestitures (2 points) and
currency (1 point). The U.S. decreased 0.6 percent, but grew 2 percent adjusted
for divestitures. There was good transactional performance in the U.S. with
strong growth across the hardware portfolio and some large software deals. The
broad based growth in the Latin American growth markets on an adjusted basis
included strong performance in Brazil and Mexico. Brazil decreased 5.4 percent
as reported, but grew11 percent adjusted for currency (14 points) and
divestitures (3 points). Mexico grew 7 percent as reported and 20 percent
adjusted for currency (8 points) and divestitures (5 points).
 
  EMEA revenue of $6,125 million
decreased 19.2 percent as reported, but only 2 percent adjusted for currency
(14 points) and divestitures (3 points) on a year-to-year basis. Major market
countries were down 19.6 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for
currency (15 points) and divestitures (3 points). Growth market countries were
down 15.8 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for divestitures (8
points) and currency (5 points). In the first quarter, there was mixed
performance within the major market countries with growth on an adjusted basis
in the UK and declines in Germany and France. From a brand perspective,
adjusted for currency, there was good growth in mainframe and Power, and
continued momentum in outsourcing signings as clients look to integrate cloud
and mobile capabilities into large scale IT environments. Overall, the
company’s performance decelerated, but it was in line with the market. Within
the growth markets, the growth on an adjusted basis in the Middle East and
Africa region was more than offset by declines in the central and eastern
European countries. Russia decreased 25.4 percent as reported and 18 percent
adjusted for divestitures.

 Asia
Pacific first quarter revenue of $4,061 million decreased 18.0 percent as
reported and 2 percent adjusted for divestitures (8 points) and currency (8
points) year over year. Japan decreased 12.7 percent as reported, but grew 4
percent adjusted for currency (14 points) and divestitures (3 points). Growth
in Japan accelerated in the first quarter on the strength of services and
hardware. Within growth markets, China decreased 36.6 percent as reported and
17 percent adjusted for divestitures (19 points) and currency (1 point). India
decreased 6.2 percent as reported and increased 4 percent adjusted for
divestitures (9 points) and currency (1 point). Although Asia Pacific growth
markets in total declined again this quarter, there was sequential improvement
in some key countries on an adjusted basis.

     Total selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expense decreased 14.5 percent in the first quarter of 2015 versus
the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by currency (8 points), lower
workforce rebalancing charges (8 points) and the impact of the divested System
x business (2 points), partially offset by an increase in retirement-related
costs which included an additional retirement-related obligation of $230
million related to a court ruling in Spain. Operating (non-GAAP) expense
decreased 18.3 percent year to year driven by primarily the same factors,
excluding the Spain pension obligation which is not reflected in operating
(non-GAAP) expense. Bad debt expense increased $28 million year to year. The
receivables provision coverage was 2.6 percent at March 31, 2015, an increase
of 40 basis points from year-end 2014 and 80 basis points from March 31, 2014.

driven by higher gains on derivative instruments ($182 million), partially
offset by the gain associated with the divestiture of the customer care
business ($98 million) in the first quarter of 2014 and higher foreign currency
transaction losses ($47 million) year to year due to foreign currency rate

        In the first
quarter of 2015, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $279
million compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily driven by an increase
in recognized actuarial losses ($198 million), higher pension obligations
resulting from a court ruling in Spain ($175 million) and lower actual return
on plan assets ($125 million), partially offset by lower interest cost ($173
million).  
 
  As discussed in the “Snapshot” on page
42, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and
others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating
retirement-related costs in the first quarter of 2015 were $379 million, a
decrease of $40 million compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily driven
by lower defined contribution plans cost ($35 million). Non-operating costs of
$442 million increased $319 million in the first quarter of 2015 year to year,
driven primarily by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($198 million),
higher pension obligations resulting from a court ruling in Spain ($175
million) and lower actual return on plan assets ($125 million), partially
offset by lower interest cost ($173 million).
 
Taxes
 
      
 The continuing operations effective tax rate
for the first quarter of 2015 was 19.5 percent, a decrease of 1.0 points
compared to the first quarter of 2014. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for
the first quarter of 2015 was 20.0 percent, a decrease of 0.5 points compared
to the first quarter of 2014.  The lower rates in the first quarter of 2015
were the result of a more favorable mix of geographic income offset by a
decrease in the utilization of foreign tax credits.
 
       With
respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is
generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2008. The
company is no longer subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax
return for years prior to 2011. The open years contain matters that could be
subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as
it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions and tax credits.
Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes
that adequate amounts of tax and interest have been provided for any
adjustments that are expected to result for these years.
 
       The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 increased by $52 million
in the first quarter of 2015 to $5,156 million. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate was $4,258 million at March 31, 2015.
 
       In
April 2010, the company appealed the determination of the Japanese Tax
Authorities with respect to certain foreign tax losses. The tax benefit of
these losses, approximately $999 million adjusted for currency, has been
included in unrecognized tax benefits. In April 2011, the company received notification
that the appeal was denied, and in June 2011, the company filed a lawsuit
challenging this decision. In May 2014, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favor
of the company. The Japanese government appealed the ruling to the Tokyo High
Court. On March 25, 2015, the Tokyo High Court ruled in favor of IBM and, on
April 7, 2015, the Japanese government appealed the ruling to the Japan Supreme
Court. No final determination has been reached on this matter.   
 
       In the
fourth quarter of 2013, the company received a draft tax assessment notice for
approximately $866 million from the Indian Tax Authorities for 2009. The
company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a

meaningful indicator of liability. At March 31, 2015,
the company has recorded $496 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A
significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time
to protect the company’s right to appeal various income tax assessments made by
the Indian Tax Authorities.
 
       In the first quarter of 2014, the IRS commenced its
audit of the company’s U.S. tax returns for 2011 and 2012. The company
anticipates that this audit will be completed by the end of 2015.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
       Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

operations, net of tax, was $88 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared
to $146 million in the first quarter of 2014. The discontinued operations
effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2015 was 26.3 percent compared to
27.9 percent in the prior year period. 
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
       At March 31, 2015, the company continues to have the
financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash and
marketable securities at quarter end were $8,803 million. Total debt of $38,827 million decreased $1,978 million from prior
year-end levels, driven by maturities of $2,824 million. The company
continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. In the first three months of
2015, the company generated $3,610 million in cash from operations, an increase
of $284 million compared to the first three months of 2014. The company
has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to
have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and
its $10 billion global credit facility.

increased $854 million from the year-end 2014 position. The key changes are
described below:      
 
       Current assets
decreased $3,105 million (a decrease of $1,015 million adjusted for currency),
due to:
 
·        
A decline of $3,532 million
($2,641 million adjusted for currency) in financing
receivables primarily due to collections of higher year-end balances; and 
 
·        
A decline of $285 million (an
increase of $142 million adjusted for currency) in trade
receivables; and  
 
·        
A decline of $240 million ($184
million adjusted for currency) in deferred taxes due primarily to changes in
the value of financial instruments, partially offset by
 
·        
An increase of $923 million
($1,109 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other driven by
increases in derivatives of $453 million and
counterparty collateral postings of $246 million due to strengthening of the
U.S. dollar.  
 
       Current liabilities
decreased $3,960 million ($2,645 million adjusted for currency), as a result
of:
 
·        
A decrease
in taxes of $1,545 million ($1,365 million adjusted for currency) primarily
driven by income tax payments; and     
 
·        
A decrease in
short-term debt of $1,199 million ($1,118 million adjusted for currency)
primarily as a result of maturities of $2,824 million and declines in
commercial paper of $650 million, partially offset by reclassifications of
$2,223 million from long term to reflect upcoming maturities; and
 
·        
A decrease in compensation and
benefits of $703 million ($533 million adjusted for currency), primarily driven by payments related to prior year performance-based
compensation, and


·        
A decrease in accounts payable of
$550 million ($352 million adjusted for currency) reflecting
declines from typically higher year-end balances and the wind-down of the System
x business payables.

to the first three months of 2014 driven by the following factors:
 
·      A decrease in income
taxes paid of $1,179 million; and
  
·        
An improvement in

A decrease of $7,000 million of
cash used for gross share repurchases, partially
offset by
 
·

       Global Financing provides financing predominantly
for the company’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract
by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global Services, generate
long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset
portfolio. Based on their attributes, these Global Services assets are
leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 68.
 
       Non-Global Financing debt of $12,585 million was up
$884 million from December 31, 2014, but down $3,142 million from the first
quarter of 2014. 
           
       Given the significant leverage, the company presents
a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes Global Financing debt and equity
as management believes this is more representative of the company’s core
business operations. This ratio can vary from period to period as the company
manages its global cash and debt positions.
 
       “Core”
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
59.6 percent at March 31, 2015 compared to 59.4 percent at December 31, 2014
and 55.3 percent at March 31, 2014. The year to year change was impacted by
pension, currency and the Microelectronics divestiture-related charges in the
second half of 2014.            
 
       Consolidated debt-to-capitalization
ratio at March 31, 2015 was 76.0 percent versus 77.3 percent at December 31,
2014 and 72.4 percent at March 31, 2014.   
 
Equity
 
       Total equity increased by $276 million from December
31, 2014 as a result of an increase in retained earnings of $1,237 million, an
increase in retirement-related pension amounts of $492 million and an increase
in common stock of $262 million, partially offset by an increase in treasury
stock of $1,259 million primarily due to common stock repurchases and declines
of $718 million related to currency translation. 
 
Looking Forward 
 
        The
company measures the success of its business model over the long term, not any
individual quarter or year. The company’s strategies, investments and actions
are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A
long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take
advantage of major shifts occurring in technology, business and the global
economy.
 
  Within the IT industry, there are
major shifts occurring—driven by data, cloud and changes in the ways
individuals and enterprises are engaging. In February 2015, the company met
with investors to discuss how it is transforming the business to where the
company sees the long term value in enterprise IT. The company’s strategic
direction is clear and compelling, and the company has been successful in
shifting to the higher value areas. The strong revenue growth in the strategic
imperatives confirms that, as does the overall profitability of the business.
The company expects the industry to continue to shift. The company expects
revenue from its strategic imperatives to continue to grow at a double-digit
rate. These offerings are as high value as other parts of the business, which
continue to manage clients’ most critical business processes. As the cloud
business gets to scale, and with ongoing productivity improvements across the
business, the company expects to have an opportunity to expand margin. In
addition, the company expects to continue to allocate its capital efficiently
and effectively to investments, and to return value to its shareholders through
a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Over the longer term, in
considering the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company expects
to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a
higher value business mix, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per
share growth, with free cash flow realization in the 90’s percent range. This
is a longer term growth trajectory, not an absolute end point or a multi-year
objective.
 
 In the first quarter of 2015, at both
the consolidated level and in the segments, the company continues to see signs
that its transformation efforts are working. In the quarter, total revenue was
flat year to year, adjusted for currency and the impact of

divested
businesses. This represented an improvement in trajectory on an adjusted basis,
driven by acceleration in the strategic imperatives. There was significant
strength in high-end systems, as the company’s new products address the most
contemporary workloads in data, cloud and mobile. This strength, together with
the overall shift to higher value, drove margin expansion for the company.
Also, workforce rebalancing charges decreased significantly year to year
contributing to profit growth in the period. The company delivered mid-single
digit operating (non-GAAP) net income growth and high-single digit operating
(non-GAAP) earnings per share growth in the first quarter compared to the prior
year. In addition, the company made several bold moves that build on the
momentum started in 2014: the introduction of System z13 mainframe in January;
the hybrid cloud announcement in February; a set of initiatives around the
Internet of Things in March; and the launch of Watson Health in early April.
Overall, a good start to the year.  
   
  Looking forward in 2015, the company
expects to continue to deliver strong growth in its strategic imperatives,
while the transitions in some of the other businesses continue. The strategic
imperatives represent a substantial part of the business, and with respect to
the more than 30 percent growth on an adjusted basis in the first quarter, part
of that growth was driven by the mainframe and Power Systems – product cycles,
as they deliver workloads in data, cloud and mobile. The company’s full year
earnings expectations do not require a 30 percent growth rate in revenue from
the strategic imperatives. The company expects the growth rate to return to
what it has been, 19 to 20 percent, a very strong growth rate, ahead of the
market and contributing growth to the total company. The company expects to
continue to expand its margin as it continues to shift to higher value, and the
company expects to continue a high level of investment – shifting that
investment to areas where it sees the best opportunities. The company is
deploying its capital thorough organic R&D, capital expenditures and
acquisitions. The company is also building partnerships and ecosystems – not
only with the large familiar companies, but with hundreds of smaller firms.
This leverages the mutual strengths of the partners and the company, and
expands the company’s reach – at a high level of return. In addition, the
company will continue to return value to shareholders through both share
repurchase and dividends. 
 
In the current currency environment, and
considering the impact from the completed divestitures, total revenue as
reported is not expected to grow in 2015. At April 2015 spot rates, the company
expects the negative impact from currency on revenue to be approximately 9
points in the second quarter and approximately 7 points for the full year. The
impact of divested businesses is expected to be 4 points in the second quarter
and 3 points for the full year 2015. Therefore, the
combined negative impact of currency at these spot rates and the divested
businesses is expected to be approximately 13 points in the second quarter and
10 points for the full year. Also, as with all companies with a similar
global business profile, with the dollar strengthening, the company expects
currency will have a significant translation impact on its profit growth. The
estimated impact to operating (non-GAAP) earnings growth in the first quarter
was $0.15-0.20 per share. The company expects to have less workforce rebalancing
charges in 2015 versus 2014, and while it may have some gains, it does not
expect to replicate the $1.8 billion of gains recorded in 2014, resulting in a
net impact to profit growth. In the second quarter of 2015, the company expects
workforce rebalancing charges to be similar to the first quarter, impacting
year-to-year profit growth. In the second quarter of 2015, with essentially the
same level of workforce rebalancing as the first quarter, the continued
transformation of the business and the mainframe cycle, the company expects a
typical sequential improvement of approximately $1 billon in operating
(non-GAAP) pre-tax income from the first quarter of 2015. Overall, the company
expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2015 to be in
the range of $14.17 to $14.92, and it continues to expect operating (non-GAAP)
earnings per share to be in the range of $15.75 to $16.50. At that level of
profit, the company continues to expect free cash flow to be flat for the year
compared to 2014, with free cash flow generation skewed to the back end of the
year. With these dynamics and level of performance, the company expects to exit
2015 as a higher value business.
 
  Within the company’s earnings per
share expectation for 2015, the company is expecting a 2-3 point benefit from
share repurchases—less than the benefit in 2014. At the end of March 2015, the
company had approximately $5 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.
With the flow through from the prior year share reduction, the first quarter
repurchase amount and the remaining authorization,  the company expects to
achieve the level of share reduction that it has assumed within its earnings
expectations for the full year 2015.
 
  From a segment perspective, in the
Systems Hardware business, with the good adoption of the z13 mainframe and
Power Systems in the first quarter, and the launch of the remaining POWER8
based systems in the second quarter, the company expects to see continued good
growth in this business. The company expects mainframe revenue to be greater in
the second quarter compared to the first quarter, but the year-to-year growth
will be lower as the mainframe business had a strong second quarter in 2014.
For the first half of 2015, the company expects mainframe revenue growth at
constant currency to be approximately 50 percent compared to the first half of
2014, which is typical for a mainframe product cycle.

(continued)
 

  The company
expects, in the normal course of business, that its effective tax rate and
operating (non-GAAP) tax rate will be approximately 20 percent in 2015. The
rate will change year to year based on nonrecurring events, such as the
settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring
factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, the timing and
amount of foreign dividend repatriation, state and local taxes and the effects
of various global income tax strategies.
 
       The company expects 2015 pre-tax retirement-related
plan cost to be approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of approximately $600
million compared to 2014. This estimate reflects current pension plan
assumptions at December 31, 2014. Within total retirement-related plan cost,
operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5
billion, a decrease of approximately $100 million versus 2014. Non-operating
retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, an
increase of approximately $700 million compared to 2014, driven by increased
recognized actuarial losses and the additional Spain pension-related
obligation. Cash disbursements for all retirement-related plans are expected to
be approximately $2.7 billion in 2015, an increase of approximately $100
million compared to 2014.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
       Changes in the relative values of non-U.S.
currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the company’s financial results and
financial position. At March 31, 2015, currency changes resulted in assets and
liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars
than at year-end 2014. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit
specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign
currency-based transactions. 
 
      Foreign currency
fluctuations often drive operational responses that mitigate the simple
mechanical translation of earnings. During periods of sustained movements in
currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For
example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of
the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position
competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially
passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition
will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that
some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to
clients. The company also maintains currency hedging programs for cash
management purposes which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of
currency impacts on the company’s financial results. 

       The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S.
operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to
“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a
simple constant currency mathematical translation of local currency results
using the comparable prior period’s currency conversion rate. However, this
constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this
information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could
take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the
company’s year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first three
months of 2015. Based on the currency rate movements in the first three months
of 2015, total revenue decreased 11.9 percent as reported and decreased 4.2
percent at constant currency versus the first three months of 2014. On an income
from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts
offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical
maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) decrease of approximately $175
million in the first three months of 2015 on an as reported basis, and a
decrease of approximately $320 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The
same mathematical exercise resulted in a decrease of approximately $60 million
in the first three months of 2014 on both an as reported and operating (non-GAAP)
basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its
as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned
above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging
instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any
particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than
the theoretical maximum given the competitive
pressure in the marketplace.
 
      
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are
reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency
risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 
 
      
The company continues to monitor the economic conditions in Venezuela. In March 2013, the Venezuelan government created a new
foreign exchange mechanism called the “Complimentary System of Foreign Currency
Acquirement” (or the “SICAD 1”). This system operates similar to an auction
system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be
used for specific import transactions. In March 2014, the Venezuelan government
published operating rules for SICAD 2 in Exchange Agreement No. 27. SICAD 2
began operating on March 24, 2014. In March 2014, the company adopted the SICAD
1 rate of 10.7 BsF per USD. In the first quarter of 2014, the company recorded
a pre-tax loss of $31 million as a result of the devaluation in Other (income)
and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In February 2015, the 

62

Venezuelan government created a new foreign exchange
platform, the Marginal Currency System, or SIMADI. The company will monitor
transactions from this new system going-forward in 2015. At March 31, 2015, the
company’s net asset position in Venezuela was $40 million. The company’s operations in Venezuela comprised
less than 1 percent of total 2014 and 2013 revenue, respectively.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
      In the company’s 2014 Annual Report, on pages 65 to 68,
there is a discussion of the company’s liquidity including two tables that
present five years of data. The table presented on page 65 includes net
cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of
the company’s global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the
three months ended, or as of, as applicable, March 31, 2015, those amounts are
$3.6 billion for net cash from operating activities, $8.8 billion of cash and
marketable securities and $10 billion in global credit facilities,
respectively. The company’s five-year global credit facility expires on
November 10, 2019. 
 
      The major rating agencies’ ratings
on the company’s debt securities at March 31, 2015 appear in the table below.
The agency ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2014. Standard and Poor’s
and Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed their credit ratings on April 21, 2015
and March 30, 2015, respectively. The company does not have “ratings trigger”
provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the
holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments
thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The company’s contractual
agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses
which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the company’s credit
rating were to fall below investment grade. At March 31, 2015, the fair value
of those instruments that were in a liability position was $181 million, before
any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair
value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments
and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that,
in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse
effect on its financial position or liquidity.

      The table appearing on page 66 of the company’s
2014 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash flows
for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of the way
cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. The company prepares its
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting
standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and
highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format
on page 59. The following is management’s view of cash flows for the first

cash flow of $1,081 million for the first three months of 2015 increased $450
million year to year. The increase was driven primarily by a reduction in cash
tax payments of $1.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2014. This was
partially

offset by changes in working capital
associated with the divestiture of the System x business and a higher level of
payments for performance-based compensation which was accrued for in 2014. Net
capital expenditures increased $36 million year to year, and spending included
a shift as the company continues to build out the SoftLayer cloud centers. In
the first three months of 2015, the company continued to focus its cash
utilization on returning value to shareholders including $1.1 billion in
dividends and $1.2 billion in common stock repurchases. 
 
       Events that could temporarily
change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the company’s
2014 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe
downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any
litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables,
which are more completely described in note 12, “Contingencies,” in this
Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $600 million in 2015. Cash disbursements related to all
retirement-related plans is expected to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2015.
Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum
contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent
remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further
impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future
movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.  
 
       The company’s U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund
its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and
financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The company’s U.S. operations generate substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has
additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity
options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional
funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit
facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany
loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.  
 
        The company does earn a significant amount
of its pre-tax income outside the U.S. The company’s policy is to indefinitely
reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and
accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The company periodically repatriates a
portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional
U.S. tax liability. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any,
associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. While the
company currently does not have a need to repatriate funds held by its foreign
subsidiaries, if these funds are needed for operations and obligations in the
U.S., the company could elect to repatriate these funds which could result in a
reassessment of the company’s policy and increased tax expense.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  
Global
Financing
 
       Global Financing is a reportable segment that is
measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients’
acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by
providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise,
while generating strong returns on equity.

       The decrease in revenue
in the first quarter, as compared to the same period in 2014, was due to:
 

64



Management Discussion –
(continued)
 

·        
A decline in external revenue of
9.9 percent (1.1 percent adjusted for currency), due to decreases in equipment
sales revenue (down 24.5 percent to $91 million) and in financing revenue (down
5.5 percent to $369 million); and
 
·        
A decline in internal revenue of
5.0 percent, due to decreases in financing revenue (down 15.4 percent to $93
million) and used equipment sales revenue (down 2.8 percent to $493 million).
 
       The decrease in external
financing revenue in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in
2014, was due to a decrease in the average asset balance. The decrease in
internal financing revenue in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same
period in 2014, was due to decreases in asset yields and the average asset
balance. 
        
       Global Financing gross
profit decreased 12.7 percent in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the
same period in 2014, due to decreases in used equipment sales gross profit and
financing gross profit. The gross profit margin decreased 4.2 points in the first
quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, due to margin decreases
in used equipment sales and financing.
 
       Global Financing pre-tax
income decreased 13.6 percent to $515 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared
to the same period in 2014, due to the lower gross profit ($102 million) and an
increase in financing receivables provisions ($19 million), partially offset by
a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses ($39 million). The
increase in financing receivables provisions was due to higher specific reserve
requirements in the current year.
 
      The decrease in return on
equity in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period of 2014, was
due to the decrease in after-tax income.

Sources and Uses of Funds
 
       The primary use of funds in Global Financing is to
originate client and commercial financing assets. Client financing assets for
end users consist of IBM systems, software and services, and OEM equipment,
software and services to meet IBM clients’ total solutions requirements. Client
financing assets are primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating
leases for systems products, as well as loans for systems, software and
services, with terms up to seven years. Global Financing’s client loans are
primarily for software and services and are unsecured. These loans are
subjected to credit analysis to evaluate the associated risk and, when deemed
necessary, actions are taken to mitigate risks in the loan agreements which
include covenants to protect against credit deterioration during the life of
the obligation. 
 
       Commercial financing receivables arise primarily
from inventory and accounts receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of
IBM and OEM products. Payment terms for inventory financing and accounts
receivable financing generally range from 30 to 90 days. These short-term
receivables are primarily unsecured and are also subjected to additional credit
analysis in order to evaluate the associated risk.
 
        In addition to the actions previously described, in
certain circumstances, the company may take mitigation actions to transfer
credit risk to third parties.
 
       At March 31, 2015, substantially all financing
assets were IT related assets, and approximately 56 percent of the total
external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to
consumers.

      Cash
collections of both commercial financing and client financing assets exceeded
new financing originations in both the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, which
resulted in a net decrease in financing assets in these periods. The decrease
in originations in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily due to lower volumes in
commercial financing. Internal loan
financing with Global Services is executed under a loan facility and is not
considered originations.
 
      
 Cash generated by Global Financing was
deployed to pay intercompany payables and dividends to IBM as well as business
partners and OEM suppliers. Intercompany payables declined in 2015 due to lower
IBM volumes and shorter settlement terms, which are in line with external
suppliers.

*    Represents reserved receivables, net of recoveries,
  that were disposed of during the period.




**  Primarily represents translation adjustments.



 
       The
percentage of Global Financing receivables
reserved increased from 1.9 percent at December 31, 2014, to 2.3 percent at
March 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in specific reserve requirements.
Specific reserves increased 7 percent from $484 million at December 31, 2014,
to $519 million at March 31, 2015. Unallocated reserves decreased 4 percent
from $96 million at December 31, 2014, to $92 million at March 31, 2015,
primarily due to the decline in gross financing receivables.   
 
       Global
Financing’s bad debt expense was $52 million for the three months ended March
31, 2015, compared to $33 million for the same period in 2014.  The
year-to-year increase in bad debt expense was due to higher specific reserve
requirements, primarily in China, in the current year. 
  
Residual
Value     
 
      
Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of
this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment
values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and
cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information,
Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values
and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
      Global Financing optimizes
the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from lease returns,
leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with
current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned off of a lease,
surplus internal equipment, or used equipment purchased externally. These sales
represented 55.9 percent of Global Financing's revenue in the first quarter of
2015, and 55.6 percent in the first quarter of 2014.  The gross profit margins
on these sales were 63.6 percent and 67.9 percent in the first quarter of 2015
and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit margin was driven by
margin decreases in internal equipment sales and external equipment sales,
partially offset by a shift in mix toward higher margin internal equipment sales.
 
       The
table on page 68 presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value
for sales-type, direct financing and operating leases at January 1, 2015 and
March 31, 2015. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a
percentage of the related original amount financed and a run out of when the
unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at March 31, 2015
is expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of
the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. While
primarily focused on IBM products, guarantees are also obtained for certain OEM
products. These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments
as provided for by accounting standards in the determination of lease
classifications for the covered equipment and provide protection against risk
of loss arising from declines in equipment values for these assets.  
 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease
payments that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a
sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate
asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were
$101 million and $86 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of direct financing
leases were $50 million and $46 million for the financing transactions originated
during the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The associated
aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were
$8 million and $5 million for the financing transactions originated during
the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cost of
guarantees was $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the quarters ended March 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively.

        The company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of
approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed
of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans
are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying
the financing receivable and are based on arm's-length pricing.
 
       Global
Financing provides financing predominantly for the company’s external client
assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously
stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and
accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s
external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing
Results of Operations” on page 64 and in “Segment Information” on page 26.
 
       In the
company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing
to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.
 
       The following table provides additional information
on total company debt. In this table, intercompany activity includes internal
loans and leases at arm’s-length pricing in support of Global Services’
long-term contracts and other internal activity. The company believes these
assets should be appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global
Financing business model.

Looking
Forward
 
        Global Financing's
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financing’s
assets and new financing volumes are IBM and OEM products and services financed
to the company’s clients and business partners, and substantially all financing
assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business for future
growth. Global Financing’s offerings are competitive and available to clients
as a result of the company’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets.
Overall, Global Financing’s originations will be dependent upon the demand for
IT products and services as well as client participation rates.
 
       IBM continues to access both the short-term commercial
paper market and the medium- and long-term debt markets. A protracted period
where IBM could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown
in originations.  
 
       Interest rates and the overall economy (including
currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both revenue and gross profit.
The company’s interest rate risk management policy, however, combined with the
Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate gross margin erosion due to
changes in interest rates.   
 
       The economy could impact the credit quality of the
Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore the level of provision for
credit losses. Global Financing will continue to apply rigorous credit policies
in both the origination of new business and the evaluation of the existing
portfolio.
 
       As previously discussed, Global Financing has
historically been able to manage residual value risk both through insight into
the company’s product cycles, as well as through its remarketing business.
 
       Global Financing has policies in
place to manage each of the key risks involved in financing. These policies,
combined with product and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent
management of the business going forward, even during periods of uncertainty
with respect to the global economy.
