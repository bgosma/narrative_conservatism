Note 1 – Interim Financial Data
Basis of Presentation
The information furnished in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).  In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 do not necessarily indicate the results which may be expected for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”).
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Toyota Motor Credit Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 4, 2019.  References herein to “TMCC” denote Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, and references herein to “we”, “our”, and “us” denote Toyota Motor Credit Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.  Related party transactions are disclosed in Note 11 – Related Party Transactions. 
Other Matters
On April 16, 2019, we announced that we will restructure our field operations over the next two years to better serve our dealer partners by streamlining our field office structure into three regional locations and investing in new technology.  Costs associated with this restructure are not expected to be significant.
TMCC has commenced preparations to launch private label finance services for third-party automotive and mobility companies.  In furtherance of this new business initiative, on August 28, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Mazda Motor of America, Inc. (“Mazda”) pursuant to which we will offer exclusive private label automotive retail, lease, and dealer financing products and services, and vehicle protection products and services to Mazda customers and dealers in the United States, launching at various times through fiscal year 2021 for an initial term of approximately five years.  We intend to leverage our existing processes and personnel to service the newly originated assets, and we expect to make certain technology investments to support the Mazda program.  TMCC will not acquire any existing Mazda assets or liabilities pursuant to the agreement and we do not expect launch costs to be significant through fiscal year 2021.

Note 1 – Interim Financial Data (Continued)
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
On April 1, 2019, we adopted the following new accounting standards:
Leases
We adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), along with the subsequently issued guidance amending and clarifying various aspects of the new lease guidance, using the modified retrospective method.  In accordance with that method, the comparative period’s information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease accounting guidance in effect for that period.  We also elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard which allowed us to not reassess our historical lease classification, initial direct costs, and whether or not contracts entered into prior to adoption are or contain leases.  As a lessor, the adoption of ASU 2016-02, did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.  As a lessee, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 added right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of $115 million and operating lease liabilities of $122 million, which are included in Other assets, and in Other liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The adoption of this new guidance did not impact our Consolidated Statement of Income and did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings.
Refer to Note 4 – Investments in Operating Leases, Net and Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.
Other Recently Adopted Standards 
We adopted ASU 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, which requires certain premiums on callable debt securities to be amortized to the earliest call date.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.  The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as we no longer have hedge accounting derivatives. 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted ASU 2019-07, Codification Updates to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Sections – Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10532, “Disclosure Update and Simplification,” and Nos. 33-10231 and 33-10442, “Investment Company Reporting Modernization,” and Miscellaneous Updates.  This guidance was effective upon issuance in July 2019 and aligns the guidance in various SEC sections to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification with the requirements of certain already effective SEC final rules.  While most of the amendments in this release eliminate outdated or duplicative disclosure requirements, the final rule release amends the interim financial statement requirements to include a reconciliation of changes in shareholder’s equity for each period for which an income statement is required to be filed.  We have disclosed the required information in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholder’s Equity.  The other eliminations or amendments did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Note 1 – Interim Financial Data (Continued)
Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This guidance introduces a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses for certain types of financial instruments.  It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  The FASB subsequently issued guidance amending and clarifying aspects of the new impairment model.  This ASU and the related amendments are effective for us on April 1, 2020.  We continue to refine and test the models, methodologies and procedures that will be used to calculate the credit loss reserves in accordance with this new accounting guidance when adopted.  Based on our current loan portfolio attributes and forecasts of future economic conditions, we expect an increase in our allowance for credit losses on finance receivables of 40% to 60% with a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.  The magnitude of the increase in our allowance for credit losses will depend on the finalization of our implementation efforts, as well as the then current macroeconomic conditions and forecasts.  We are currently evaluating the other potential impacts of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement.  This ASU is effective for us on April 1, 2020.  The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software, which aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software.  This ASU is effective for us on April 1, 2020.  While we continue to evaluate the potential impacts of this guidance, we believe it is consistent with our current accounting for cloud computing arrangements and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810), which requires indirect interests held through related parties in common control arrangements to be considered on a proportional basis for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests.  This ASU is effective for us on April 1, 2021.  The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. The applicable provisions of this ASU are effective for us on April 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance related to Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our adoption status for Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses is discussed above.

Note 2 – Investments in Marketable Securities
Investments in marketable securities consist of debt securities and equity investments.  We classify all of our debt securities as available-for-sale.  All equity investments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in Investment and other income, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.

A portion of our equity investments are investments in funds that are privately placed and managed by an open-end investment management company (the “Trust”).  If we elect to redeem shares, the Trust will normally redeem all shares for cash, but may, in unusual circumstances, redeem amounts exceeding the lesser of $250 thousand or 1 percent of the Trust’s asset value by payment in kind of securities held by the respective fund during any 90-day period.
We also invest in actively traded open-end mutual funds.  Redemptions are subject to normal terms and conditions as described in each fund’s prospectus.

Note 3 – Finance Receivables, Net (Continued)
Credit Quality Indicators
We are exposed to credit risk on our finance receivables.  Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the failure of customers or dealers to meet the terms of their contracts with us or otherwise fail to perform as agreed.
Retail Loan Portfolio Segment
The retail loan portfolio segment consists of one class of finance receivables.  While we use various credit quality metrics to develop our allowance for credit losses on the retail loan portfolio segment, we primarily utilize the aging of the individual accounts to monitor the credit quality of these finance receivables.  Based on our experience, the payment status of borrowers is the strongest indicator of the credit quality of the underlying receivables.  Payment status also impacts charge-offs.
Individual borrower accounts within the retail loan portfolio segment are segregated into aging categories based on the number of days past due.  The aging for each class of finance receivables is updated monthly.
Dealer Products Portfolio Segment
For the three classes of finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment (wholesale, real estate and working capital), all loans outstanding for an individual dealer or dealer group, which includes affiliated entities, are aggregated and evaluated collectively by dealer or dealer group.  This reflects the interconnected nature of financing provided to our individual dealer and dealer group customers, and their affiliated entities.
When assessing the credit quality of the finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment, we segregate the finance receivables account balances into four categories representing distinct credit quality indicators based on internal risk assessments.  The internal risk assessments for all finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment are updated on a monthly basis.
The four credit quality indicators are:




 

•

Performing – Account not classified as either Credit Watch, At Risk or Default;




 

•

Credit Watch – Account designated for elevated attention;




 

•

At Risk – Account where there is an increased likelihood that default may exist based on qualitative and quantitative factors; and




 

•

Default – Account is not currently meeting contractual obligations or we have temporarily waived certain contractual requirements
The tables below present each credit quality indicator by class of finance receivables:

The following tables summarize the aging of finance receivables by class:

Impaired Finance Receivables
The following table summarizes the information related to our impaired loans by class of finance receivables: 
 


The primary source of interest income recognized on the loans in the table above is from performing troubled debt restructurings within the dealer products portfolio segment.  Interest income on impaired finance receivables and interest income recognized using a cash-basis method of accounting during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant.  As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the impaired finance receivables balance for accounts in the dealer products portfolio segment that were on nonaccrual status was $360 million and $329 million, respectively, and there were no charge-offs against the allowance for credit losses for these finance receivables.  Therefore, the impaired finance receivables balance is equal to the unpaid principal balance.  
 
As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, impaired finance receivables in the retail loan portfolio segment recorded at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs were not significant and therefore excluded from the table above.  Refer to Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses for details related to the retail loan portfolio segment’s impaired account balances which are aggregated and evaluated for impairment when determining the allowance for credit losses.

Note 3 – Finance Receivables, Net (Continued)
Troubled Debt Restructuring
For accounts not under bankruptcy protection, the amount of finance receivables modified as a troubled debt restructuring during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was not significant for each class of finance receivables.  Troubled debt restructurings for accounts not under bankruptcy protection within the retail loan class of finance receivables are comprised exclusively of contract term extensions that reduce the monthly payment due from the customer.  For the three classes of finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment, troubled debt restructurings include contract term extensions, interest rate adjustments, waivers of loan covenants, or any combination of the three.  Troubled debt restructurings of accounts not under bankruptcy protection did not include forgiveness of principal or interest rate adjustments during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
We consider finance receivables under bankruptcy protection within the retail loan class to be troubled debt restructurings as of the date we receive notice of a customer filing for bankruptcy protection, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.  The bankruptcy court may impose modifications as part of the proceedings, including interest rate adjustments and forgiveness of principal.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the financial impact of troubled debt restructurings related to finance receivables under bankruptcy protection was not significant to our Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 4 – Investments in Operating Leases, Net
In conjunction with the April 1, 2019 adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases, as described in Note 1 – Interim Financial Data, we updated our accounting policies and disclosures below.
Investments in operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle lease contracts acquired from dealers.  Generally, lessees have the ability to extend their lease term in six month increments up to a total of 12 months from the original lease maturity date.  A lease can be terminated at any time by satisfying the obligations under the lease contract.  Early termination programs may be occasionally offered to eligible lessees.  At the end of the lease, the customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle or return the vehicle to the dealer.  
Securitized investments in operating leases represent beneficial interests in a pool of certain vehicle leases that have been sold for legal purposes to securitization trusts but continue to be included in our consolidated financial statements as discussed further in Note 8 - Variable Interest Entities.  Cash flows from these securitized investments in operating leases are available only for the repayment of debt issued by these trusts and other obligations arising from the securitization transactions.  They are not available for payment of our other obligations or to satisfy claims of our other creditors.
Operating lease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  We have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the consideration in the contract, and from variable payments not included in the consideration in the contract, sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific lease revenue-producing transaction and collected from customers.  Deferred fees and costs, including incentive payments made to dealers and acquisition fees collected from customers, and payments received on affiliate sponsored subvention and other incentive programs are capitalized or deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.  The accrual of revenue on investments in operating leases is discontinued at the time an account is determined to be uncollectible and subsequent revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received.  Operating leases may be restored to accrual status when future payments are reasonably assured.  
 
Vehicle Lease Residual Values
Contractual residual values of vehicle lease contracts are estimated at lease inception by examining external industry data, the anticipated Toyota and Lexus product pipeline and our own experience.  Factors considered in this evaluation include, but are not limited to, economic forecasts, new vehicle pricing, new vehicle incentive programs, new vehicle sales, competitor actions and behavior, vehicle features and specifications, the mix and level of used vehicle supply, the level of current used vehicle values, buying and leasing behavior trends, and fuel prices.  We are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at inception of the lease and if the number of returned vehicles is higher than anticipated.
Depreciation on operating leases is recognized using the straight-line method over the lease term.  The depreciable basis is the original acquisition cost of the vehicle less the estimated residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term.  On a quarterly basis, we review the estimated end-of-term market values and return rates of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying values at lease-end.  Factors affecting the estimated end-of-term market value are similar to those considered in the evaluation of residual values at lease inception discussed above.  Adjustments to depreciation expense to reflect revised estimates of expected market values at lease termination and revised return rates are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.
We use various channels to sell vehicles returned at lease-end. Upon disposition, a gain or loss is recorded for any difference between the net book value of the lease and the proceeds received from the disposition of the asset, including any insurance proceeds.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Finance Receivables by Portfolio Segment

The ending balance of finance receivables collectively evaluated for impairment in the above table includes approximately $251 million of finance receivables within the retail loan portfolio segment that are specifically identified as impaired.  These amounts are aggregated within their respective portfolio segment when determining the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019, as they are deemed to be insignificant for individual evaluation, and we have determined that the allowance for credit losses is not significant and would not be materially different if the amounts had been individually evaluated for impairment.  The ending balance of finance receivables for the dealer products portfolio segment collectively evaluated for impairment as of December 31, 2019 includes $1,024 million in finance receivables that are guaranteed by Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (“TMNA”), and $137 million in finance receivables that are guaranteed by third party private Toyota distributors.  These finance receivables are related to certain Toyota and Lexus dealers and other third parties to whom we provided financing at the request of TMNA and third party private Toyota distributors.

Note 6 – Derivatives, Hedging Activities and Interest Expense
Derivative Instruments
Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and variable rate debt, denominated in U.S. dollars and various other currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables.  We enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, and foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities.  Our use of derivative transactions is intended to reduce long-term fluctuations in the fair value of assets and liabilities caused by market movements.  All of our derivative activities are authorized and monitored by our management and our Asset Liability Committee which provides a framework for financial controls and governance to manage market risk.    
Offsetting of Derivatives
The accounting guidance permits the net presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.  When we meet this condition, we elect to present such balances on a net basis.  
Our International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreements are our master netting agreements which permit multiple transactions to be cancelled and settled with a single net balance paid to either party.  The master netting agreements also contain reciprocal collateral agreements which require the transfer of cash collateral to the party in a net asset position across all transactions.  Our collateral agreements with substantially all our counterparties include a zero threshold, full collateralization arrangement.  Although we have daily valuation and collateral exchange arrangements with all of our counterparties, due to the time required to move collateral, there may be a delay of up to one day between the exchange of collateral and the valuation of our derivatives.  We would not be required to post additional collateral to the counterparties with whom we were in a net liability position at December 31, 2019 if our credit ratings were to decline, since we fully collateralize without regard to credit ratings with these counterparties.  In addition, as our collateral agreements include legal right of offset provisions, collateral amounts are netted against derivative assets or derivative liabilities, the net amount of which is included in Other assets or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 7 – Debt and Credit Facilities
Debt and the related weighted average contractual interest rates are summarized as follows:
 


The carrying value of our debt includes unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs and the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments.  
Weighted average contractual interest rates are calculated based on original notional or par value before consideration of premium or discount and approximate the effective interest rates.  Debt is callable at par value.  
Unsecured Notes and Loans Payable 
Our unsecured notes and loans payable consist of commercial paper and fixed and variable rate debt.  Short-term funding needs are met through the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S.  Amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs were $27.5 billion and $25.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
Upon issuance of fixed rate debt, we generally elect to enter into pay-float swaps to convert fixed rate payments on debt to floating rate payments.  Certain unsecured notes and loans payable are denominated in various foreign currencies.  The debt is translated into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate at the transaction date and retranslated at each balance sheet date using the exchange rate in effect at that date.  Concurrent with the issuance of these foreign currency unsecured notes and loans payable, we enter into currency swaps in the same notional amount to convert non-U.S. currency payments to U.S. dollar denominated payments.  Gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions are included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Certain of our unsecured notes and loans payable contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants and conditions.  
Secured Notes and Loans Payable
Our secured notes and loans payable are denominated in U.S. dollars and consist of both fixed and variable rate debt.  Secured notes and loans payable are issued using on-balance sheet securitization trusts, as further discussed in Note 8 – Variable Interest Entities.  These notes are repayable only from collections on the underlying securitized retail finance receivables and the beneficial interests in investments in operating leases and from related credit enhancements.
In June 2019, we completed an offering of secured notes under a new revolving asset-backed securitization program, backed by a revolving pool of finance receivables and cash collateral. Cash flows from these receivables during the revolving period in excess of what is needed to pay certain expenses of the securitization trust and contractual interest payments on the related secured notes may be used to purchase additional receivables, provided that certain conditions are met following the purchase.  The secured notes feature a scheduled five year revolving period, with the ability to repay the secured notes in full, after which an amortization period begins. The revolving period may also end with the amortization period beginning upon the occurrence of certain events that include certain segregated account balances falling below their required levels, credit losses or delinquencies on the pool of assets supporting the notes exceeding specified levels, the adjusted pool balance falling to less than 50% of the initial principal amount of the secured notes, or interest not being paid on the secured notes.

Note 7 – Debt and Credit Facilities (Continued) 
Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit
For additional liquidity purposes, we maintain credit facilities as described below:
364 Day Credit Agreement, Three Year Credit Agreement and Five Year Credit Agreement
In November 2019, TMCC, Toyota Credit de Puerto Rico Corp. (“TCPR”) and other Toyota affiliates entered into a $5.0 billion 364 day syndicated bank credit facility, a $5.0 billion three year syndicated bank credit facility and a $5.0 billion five year syndicated bank credit facility, expiring in fiscal 2021, 2023, and 2025, respectively.
The ability to make draws is subject to covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These agreements may be used for general corporate purposes and none were drawn upon as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019.  We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above.
Other Unsecured Credit Agreements
TMCC has entered into additional unsecured credit facilities with various banks.  As of December 31, 2019, TMCC had committed bank credit facilities totaling $4.6 billion, of which $150 million, $2.4 billion, $75 million and $2.0 billion mature in fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.
These credit agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These credit facilities were not drawn upon as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above.
TMCC is party to a $5.0 billion three year revolving credit facility with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. expiring in fiscal 2022.  This credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes and was not drawn upon as of December 31, 2019. 
From time to time, we may borrow from affiliates based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative cost of funds, and market access capabilities.  Amounts borrowed from affiliates are recorded in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 8 – Variable Interest Entities
Consolidated Variable Interest Entities
We use one or more special purpose entities that are considered Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) to issue asset-backed securities to third party bank-sponsored asset-backed securitization vehicles and to investors in securitization transactions.  The securities issued by these VIEs are backed by the cash flows related to retail finance receivables and beneficial interests in investments in operating leases (“Securitized Assets”).  We hold variable interests in the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.  We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization trusts because (i) our servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs, and (ii) our variable interests in the VIEs give us the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant.
The following tables show the assets and liabilities related to our VIE securitization transactions that were included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets:
 


 


 
Restricted Cash, including cash equivalents, shown in the table above represents collections from the underlying Gross Securitized Assets shown in the table above and certain reserve deposits held by TMCC for the VIEs and is included as part of Restricted cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net Securitized Assets shown in the table above are presented net of deferred fees and costs, deferred income, accumulated depreciation and the allowance for credit losses.  Other Assets represent used vehicles held-for-sale that were repossessed by or returned to TMCC for the benefit of the VIEs.  The related debt of these consolidated VIEs is presented net of $1,315 million and $1,486 million of securities retained by TMCC at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.  Other Liabilities represents accrued interest on the debt of the consolidated VIEs.
The assets of the VIEs and the restricted cash and cash equivalents held by TMCC serve as the sole source of repayment for the asset-backed securities issued by these entities.  Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to us or our other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities.
As the primary beneficiary of these entities, we are exposed to credit, residual value, interest rate, and prepayment risk from the Securitized Assets in the VIEs.  However, our exposure to these risks did not change as a result of the transfer of the assets to the VIEs.  We may also be exposed to interest rate risk arising from the secured notes issued by the VIEs.
In addition, we are party to interest rate swaps with certain special purpose entities that issue variable rate debt.  Under the terms of these swaps, the special purpose entities are obligated to pay TMCC a fixed rate of interest on certain payment dates in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on notional amounts equal to the outstanding balance of the secured debt.  This arrangement enables the special purpose entities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in issuing variable rate debt that is secured by fixed rate Securitized Assets.

Note 8 – Variable Interest Entities (Continued)
The transfers of the Securitized Assets to the special purpose entities in our securitizations are considered to be sales for legal purposes.  However, the Securitized Assets and the related debt remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We recognize financing revenue on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the secured debt issued by the special purpose entities.  We also maintain an allowance for credit losses on the Securitized Assets to cover estimated probable credit losses using a methodology consistent with that used for our non-securitized asset portfolio.  The interest rate swaps between TMCC and the special purpose entities are considered intercompany transactions and therefore are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
Non-consolidated Variable Interest Entities
We provide lending to Toyota and Lexus dealers through the Toyota Dealer Investment Group’s Dealer Capital Program (“TDIG Program”) operated by our affiliate TMNA, which has an equity interest in these dealerships.  Dealers participating in this program have been determined to be VIEs.  We do not consolidate the dealerships in this program as we are not the primary beneficiary and any exposure to loss is limited to the amount of the credit facility.  Amounts due from these dealers under the TDIG Program that are classified as Finance receivables, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 and revenues earned from these dealers for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. 
We also have other lending relationships, which have been determined to be VIEs, but these relationships are not consolidated as we are not the primary beneficiary.  Amounts due and revenues earned under these relationships as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant.

Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments and Guarantees
We have entered into certain commitments and guarantees for which the maximum unfunded amounts are summarized in the table below:


 
Wholesale financing is not considered to be a contractual commitment as the arrangements are not binding arrangements under which TMCC is required to perform.
 
Lease Commitments
We have a lease agreement through August 2032, with TMNA for our headquarters facility in Plano, Texas.  Total operating lease expense, including payments to affiliates, was $27 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019.  Commitments under operating lease agreements in the table above include $77 million and $97 million for facility leases with affiliates at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
Our remaining operating lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate leases. Lease terms may contain renewal and extension options or early termination features. Generally, these options do not impact the lease term because TMCC is not reasonably certain that it will exercise the options. These lease agreements do not impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements, nor do they have residual value guarantees. We exclude from our Consolidated Balance Sheets leases with a term equal to one year or less and do not separate non-lease components from our real estate leases.
Our commitments under operating lease agreements are summarized below:


1 Amounts due on operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 excludes the amounts incurred for the nine months ended December 31, 2019.
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term.  As the interest rate implicit in the lease contract is typically not readily determinable, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date and for the duration of the lease term.

Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)
The following table provides additional information related to operating lease agreements for which we are the lessee:
 


 
Commitments
We provide fixed and variable rate working capital loans, revolving lines of credit, and real estate financing to dealers and various multi-franchise organizations referred to as dealer groups for facilities construction and refurbishment, working capital requirements, real estate purchases, business acquisitions and other general business purposes.  These loans are typically secured with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, and may be guaranteed by individual or corporate guarantees of affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals.  Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure under such agreements.  Our pricing reflects market conditions, the competitive environment, the level of support dealers provide our retail, lease and insurance business and the credit worthiness of each dealer.  Amounts drawn under these facilities are reviewed for collectability on a quarterly basis, in conjunction with our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses.  We have also extended credit facilities to affiliates as described in Note 12 – Related Party Transactions in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K. 
Guarantees and Other Contingencies
TMCC has guaranteed bond obligations totaling $100 million in principal that were issued by Putnam County, West Virginia and Gibson County, Indiana to finance the construction of pollution control facilities at manufacturing plants of certain TMCC affiliates.  The bonds mature in the following fiscal years ending March 31: 2028 - $20 million; 2029 - $50 million; 2030 - $10 million; 2031 - $10 million; and 2032 - $10 million.  TMCC would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-payment on the bonds and other related obligations.  TMCC is entitled to reimbursement by the applicable affiliates for any amounts paid.  TMCC receives a nominal annual fee for guaranteeing such payments.  TMCC has not been required to perform under any of these affiliate bond guarantees as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019.
 
Indemnification
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements containing indemnification provisions standard in the industry related to several types of transactions, including, but not limited to, debt funding, derivatives, securitization transactions, and our vendor and supplier agreements.  Performance under these indemnities would occur upon a breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made or given, or a third party claim. In addition, we have agreed in certain debt and derivative issuances, and subject to certain exceptions, to gross-up payments due to third parties in the event that withholding tax is imposed on such payments.  In addition, certain of our funding arrangements may require us to pay lenders for increased costs due to certain changes in laws or regulations.  Due to the difficulty in predicting events which could cause a breach of the indemnification provisions or trigger a gross-up or other payment obligation, we are not able to estimate our maximum exposure to future payments that could result from claims made under such provisions.  We have not made any material payments in the past as a result of these provisions, and as of December 31, 2019, we determined that it is not probable that we will be required to make any material payments in the future.  As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, no amounts have been recorded under these indemnification provisions.

Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)
Litigation and Governmental Proceedings
Various legal actions, governmental proceedings and other claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  Certain of these actions are or purport to be class action suits, seeking sizeable damages and/or changes in our business operations, policies and practices.  Certain of these actions are similar to suits that have been filed against other financial institutions and captive finance companies.  In addition, we are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, and investigations from time to time at the state and federal levels.  It is inherently difficult to predict the course of such legal actions and governmental inquiries.  
We perform periodic reviews of pending claims and actions to determine the probability of adverse verdicts and resulting amounts of liability.  We establish accruals for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  When we are able, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability.  Given the inherent uncertainty associated with legal matters, the actual costs of resolving legal claims and associated costs of defense may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts for which accruals have been established.  Based on available information and established accruals, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the results of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Note 10 – Income Taxes 
Our effective tax rate was 16 percent and 23 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to 24 percent and 26 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  Our provision for income taxes was $34 million and $296 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $69 million and $178 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The decrease in our provision for income taxes for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the decrease in income before taxes.  The increase in our provision for income taxes for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the increase in income before taxes.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the tax benefit from the federal tax credit for fuel cell vehicles which was extended by the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 1865) in December 2019 and applies retroactively to fuel cell vehicles purchased on or after January 1, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate also reflects state tax law changes taking effect in this fiscal year.
Tax-related Contingencies
As of December 31, 2019, we remain under IRS examination for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.  
We periodically review our uncertain tax positions.  Our assessment is based on many factors including any ongoing IRS audits.  For the three months ended December 31, 2019, our assessment did not result in a material change in unrecognized tax benefits.
Our deferred tax assets were $1.4 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively, and were primarily due to the deferred deduction of allowance for credit losses and residual value losses and federal tax loss carryforward which has no expiration.  The total deferred tax liability, net of these deferred tax assets, was $5.7 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.  Realization with respect to the federal tax loss carryforward is dependent on generating sufficient income.  Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.  The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced if management’s estimates change.

TMCC receives subvention payments from TMNA which results in a gross monthly subvention receivable.  As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the subvention receivable from TMNA was $171 million.  We have a master netting agreement with TMNA which allows us to net settle payments for shared services and subvention transactions.  Under this agreement, as of December 31, 2019, we had a net amount receivable from TMNA, which resulted in the subvention receivable being recorded in Other receivables, net in Other assets.  As of March 31, 2019, we had a net amount payable to TMNA, which resulted in the subvention receivable being recorded in Other payables, net in Other liabilities.

Insurance operations – Revenue Recognition
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 85 percent and 84 percent, respectively, of Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues in the Insurance operations segment were accounted for under the guidance for revenue from contracts with customers.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, approximately 84 percent of Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues in the Insurance operations segment were accounted for under the guidance for revenue from contracts with customers.
The Insurance operations segment defers contractually determined incentives paid to dealers as contract costs for selling vehicle and payment protection products.  These costs are recorded in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income using a methodology consistent with the recognition of revenue.  The amount of capitalized dealer incentives and the related amortization was not significant to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
We had $2.2 billion of unearned insurance premiums and contract revenues from contracts with customers included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 1, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.  We recognized $216 million and $519 million of these balances in Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $159 million and $504 million recognized during the same periods in fiscal 2019.  At December 31, 2019, we had unearned insurance premiums and contract revenues of $2.3 billion included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and with respect to this balance we expect to recognize revenue of $188 million during fiscal 2020, and $2.1 billion thereafter.  At December 31, 2018 we had unearned insurance premiums and contract revenues of $2.2 billion associated with outstanding contracts.

OVERVIEW
Key Performance Indicators and Factors Affecting Our Business
In our finance operations, we generate revenue, income, and cash flows by providing retail, lease, and dealer financing to dealers and their customers.  We measure the performance of our finance operations using the following metrics: financing volume, market share, financing margins, operating and administrative expense, residual value and credit loss metrics.
In our insurance operations, we generate revenue primarily through marketing, underwriting, and providing claims administration for products that cover certain risks of dealers and their customers.  We measure the performance of our insurance operations using the following metrics: issued agreement volume, average number of agreements in force, loss metrics and investment income.
Our financial results are affected by a variety of economic and industry factors including, but not limited to, new and used vehicle markets, Toyota and Lexus sales volume, new vehicle incentive programs, consumer behavior, employment levels, our ability to respond to changes in interest rates with respect to both contract pricing and funding, the actual or perceived quality, safety or reliability of Toyota and Lexus vehicles, the financial health of the dealers we finance, and competitive pressure.  Our financial results may also be affected by the regulatory environment in which we operate, including as a result of new legislation or changes in regulation and any compliance costs or changes we may be required to make to our business practices.  All of these factors can influence consumer contract and dealer financing volume, the number of consumer contracts and dealers that default and the loss per occurrence, our inability to realize originally estimated contractual residual values on leased vehicles, the volume and performance of our insurance operations, and our gross margins on consumer and dealer financing volume.  Changes in the volume of vehicle sales, sales of our insurance and vehicle and payment protection products, or the level of insurance losses could materially and adversely impact our insurance operations.  Additionally, our funding programs and related costs are influenced by changes in the global capital markets, prevailing interest rates, and our credit ratings and those of our parent companies, which may affect our ability to obtain cost effective funding to support earning asset growth.

Fiscal 2020 First Nine Months Operating Environment
During the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”), the United States (“U.S.”) economy continued to expand.  The unemployment rate remained at historically low levels and consumer confidence remained at historically high levels, however wage growth slowed.  Uncertainties surrounding geopolitical events, trade policy, the future path of U.S. monetary policy, and caution by global central banks continue to impact the outlook for future economic growth.  In addition, student and auto related debt balances and delinquencies remained at high levels and represented a larger portion of the consumer debt mix.  Changes in the economy that adversely impact the consumer, such as higher interest rates, elevated debt levels and an increase in unemployment from the current low levels could adversely impact our results of operations in the future.  
Industry-wide vehicle sales and sales incentives in the U.S. were relatively consistent during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.  Despite lower levels of subvention, our financing volume increased 11 percent and our market share increased approximately 4 percentage points for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, as a result of TMNA and TMCC cash incentive programs and our other competitive rate programs.
Average used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles remained relatively consistent in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019; however, average used vehicle values declined in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.  Declines in used vehicle values resulting from increases in the supply of used vehicles, increases in new vehicle sales incentives and a larger lease portfolio resulting in higher future maturities could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, depreciation expense and credit losses in the future.
We continue to maintain broad global access to both domestic and international funding markets.  Conditions in the global capital markets were generally stable during the first nine months of fiscal 2020.  However, uncertainty regarding geopolitical events, trade policy, and the future path of U.S. monetary policy led to instances of volatility during the period.  Future changes in interest rates in the U.S. and foreign markets could result in volatility in our interest expense, which could affect our results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table summarizes total net income by our reportable operating segments:
 


 




1

Refer to Note 13 - Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the total asset balances of our finance and insurance operations.
Our consolidated net income was $999 million and $181 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $500 million and $214 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The increase in net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a $331 million increase in total financing revenues, a $225 million decrease in depreciation on operating leases, a $108 million increase in investment and other income, net, partially offset by a $118 million increase in provision for income taxes and a $82 million increase in operating and administrative expense.  The decrease in net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a $59 million increase in operating and administrative expense, a $56 million increase in interest expense, and an $11 million decrease in investment and other income, net, partially offset by a $76 million increase in total financing revenues, and a $35 million decrease in provision for income taxes. 
Our overall capital position increased $1.0 billion, bringing total shareholder’s equity to $14.6 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $13.6 billion at March 31, 2019.  Our debt increased to $97.5 billion at December 31, 2019 from $92.9 billion at March 31, 2019.  Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 6.7 at December 31, 2019 from 6.8 at March 31, 2019.

Finance Operations
The following table summarizes key results of our finance operations:
 


 
Our finance operations reported net income of $810 million and $146 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $414 million and $166 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The increase in net income from finance operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a $331 million increase in total financing revenues, a $225 million decrease in depreciation on operating leases, partially offset by a $85 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a $70 million increase in operating and administrative expenses.  The decrease in net income from finance operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a $59 million increase in operating and administrative expenses, a $54 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $76 million increase in total financing revenues.  
Financing Revenues
Total financing revenues increased 4 percent and 3 percent during the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019 due to the following:




 

•

Operating lease revenues increased 1 percent in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 due to higher portfolio yields.  Operating lease revenues remained relatively unchanged in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to same period in fiscal 2019.




 

•

Retail financing revenues increased 14 percent for both the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, due to higher portfolio yields as well as higher average outstanding earning asset balances.




 

•

Dealer financing revenues increased 3 percent in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher average outstanding earning asset balances and higher portfolio yields.  Dealer financing revenues decreased 4 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower portfolio yield, partially offset by higher average outstanding earning balances.
As a result of the above, our total portfolio yield, which includes operating lease, retail and dealer financing revenues, increased to 4.8 percent for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to 4.3 percent for the same period in fiscal 2019.  For the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, our total portfolio yield remained unchanged at 4.6 percent.
48

 
Depreciation on Operating Leases
We reported depreciation on operating leases of $4,920 million and $1,712 million during the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $5,145 million and $1,717 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019. The decrease in depreciation expense during the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, is due to lower expectations of residual value losses on our more recent originations and lower average operating units outstanding.  Depreciation expense on operating leases remained relatively unchanged during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, as the decrease from lower average operating units outstanding was mostly offset by higher residual value losses.
49

 
Interest Expense
Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and variable rate debt, denominated in U.S. dollars and various other currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables.  We enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate floors and foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities.  The following table summarizes the components of interest expense:
 


During the first nine months of fiscal 2020, total interest expense decreased to $2,065 million from $2,083 million in the same period in fiscal 2019.  The decrease is attributable to lower losses on U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and gains on foreign currency swaps and debt denominated in foreign currencies partially offset by an increase in interest expense on debt and derivatives.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, total interest expense increased to $755 million from $699 million in the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to losses on debt denominated in foreign currencies net of foreign currency swaps and an increase in interest expense on debt and derivatives partially offset by lower losses on U.S. dollar interest rate swaps.
Interest expense on debt and derivatives primarily represents contractual net interest settlements and changes in accruals on secured and unsecured notes and loans payable and derivatives, and includes amortization of discounts, premiums, and debt issuance costs.  Interest expense on debt and derivatives in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased to $2,014 million and $671 million, respectively, from $1,839 million and $648 million, respectively, in the same periods in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower income from pay-fixed swaps as a result of decreases in the weighted average notional on derivatives. 
Gains or losses on debt denominated in foreign currencies represent the impact of translation adjustments.  We use foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the debt denominated in foreign currencies.  During the first nine months of fiscal 2020, we recorded total gains of $27 million, primarily as a result of decreases in foreign currency swap rates across the various currencies in which our debt is denominated.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded net losses of $67 million, as losses on our debt denominated in foreign currencies were partially offset by gains on our foreign currency swaps as a result of increases in foreign currency swap rates across the various currencies in which our debt is denominated.  During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we recorded net losses of $10 million, as losses on our foreign currency swaps were largely offset by gains on our debt denominated in foreign currencies as a result of offsetting changes in foreign currency swap rates across the various currencies in which our debt is denominated.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded net gains of $38 million, as gains on our debt denominated in foreign currencies were partially offset by losses on our foreign currency swaps as a result of decreases in foreign currency swap rates across most tenors. 
Gains or losses on U.S. dollar interest rate swaps represent the change in the valuation of interest rate swaps.  During the first nine months of fiscal 2020, we recorded losses of $78 million, as losses on our higher notional, shorter-term pay-fixed swaps exceeded gains on our longer-term pay-float swaps, primarily as a result of decreases in U.S. dollar swap rates.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded losses of $17 million, as losses on our longer-term pay-float swaps exceeded gains on our shorter-term pay fixed swaps, primarily as a result of increases in U.S. dollar swap rates, particularly in the longer tenors.  During the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded losses of $234 million and $89 million, respectively, as losses on our higher-notional, shorter-term pay-fixed swaps exceeded the gains on our longer-term pay-float swaps primarily as a result of decreases in U.S. dollar swap rates across most tenors, particularly in the longer tenors.
Future changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates could result in significant volatility in our interest expense, thereby affecting our results of operations.

Investment and Other Income, Net
We recorded investment and other income, net of $117 million and $42 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $142 million and $43 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The decrease in investment and other income, net for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in our marketable securities portfolio balance for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019.
Provision for Credit Losses
We recorded a provision for credit losses of $264 million and $128 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $266 million and $110 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The increase in the provision for credit losses for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was due to an increase in past due accounts, higher loss severity and overall growth in our retail portfolio, partially offset by our dealer portfolio which had a lower provision for credit losses. We had a higher deterioration in the performance of certain dealers in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
Operating and Administrative Expenses
We recorded operating and administrative expenses of $832 million and $318 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $762 million and $259 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019. The increase in operating and administrative expenses for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was due to an increase in employee, marketing, technology, and general operating expenses. 
51

 
Insurance Operations
The following table summarizes key results of our insurance operations:
 


Our insurance operations reported net income of $189 million and $35 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $86 million and $48 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The increase in net income from insurance operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to $133 million increase in investment and other income, net, partially offset by a $33 million increase in provision for income taxes.  The decrease in net income from insurance operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a $12 million decrease in investment and other income, net and a $10 million increase in losses and loss adjustment expense.
Agreements issued increased 6 percent and 7 percent for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, primarily due to increased sales of certified pre-owned warranties, prepaid maintenance agreements, and vehicle services agreements.  The average number of agreements in force increased 6 percent for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, due to insurance portfolio growth in recent years, most notably in guaranteed auto protection agreements, prepaid maintenance agreements, and tire and wheel protection agreements.  
Revenue from Insurance Operations
Our insurance operations reported insurance earned premiums and contract revenues of $692 million and $231 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $676 million and $226 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues represent revenues from in force agreements and are affected by issuances as well as the level, age, and mix of in force agreements.  Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements in relation to the timing and level of anticipated claims.  The increase in insurance earned premiums and contract revenues in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to insurance portfolio growth in recent years.  

52

 
Investment and Other Income, Net
Our insurance operations reported investment and other income, net of $171 million and $19 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $38 million and $31 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  Investment and other income, net, consists primarily of dividend and interest income, realized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities, changes in fair value from equity investments, and other-than-temporary impairment on available-for-sale debt securities, if any.  The increase in investment and other income, net in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to increased gains from changes in fair value of equity investments and increased dividend income from our equity investments.  The decrease in investment and other income, net in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to increased losses from changes in fair value of equity investments, partially offset by increased dividend income from our equity investments. 
Insurance Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Our insurance operations reported insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of $344 million and $116 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $343 million and $106 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred are a function of the amount of covered risks, the frequency and severity of claims associated with in force agreements and the level of risk retained by our insurance operations.  Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses include amounts paid and accrued for reported losses, estimates of losses incurred but not reported, and any related claim adjustment expenses. The insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, remained relatively unchanged.  The increase in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to insurance portfolio growth.  
Operating and Administrative Expenses
Our insurance operations reported operating and administrative expenses of $269 million and $88 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $257 million and $88 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  While operating and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were flat compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, the increase in operating and administrative expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily attributable to higher dealer back-end program expenses as well as higher product expenses driven by the continued growth of our insurance business.  Insurance dealer back-end program expenses are incentives or expense reduction programs we provide to dealers based on certain performance criteria.   
  

53

 
Provision for Income Taxes 
Our overall provision for income taxes was $296 million and $34 million for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to $178 million and $69 million for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  Our effective tax rate was 23 percent and 16 percent for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to 26 percent and 24 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2019.  The increase in our provision for income taxes for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the increase in income before taxes.  The decrease in our provision for income taxes for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the decrease in income before taxes.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the tax benefit from the federal tax credit for fuel cell vehicles which was extended by the Taxpayer Certainty Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 1865) in December 2019 and applies retroactively to fuel cell vehicles purchased on or after January 1, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate also reflects state tax law changes taking effect in this fiscal year.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Vehicle Financing Volume and Net Earning Assets
The composition of our vehicle contract volume and market share is summarized below:
 


 






2

Represents the percentage of total domestic TMNA sales of new Toyota and Lexus vehicles financed by us, excluding sales under dealer rental car and commercial fleet programs and sales of a private Toyota distributor.
 
Vehicle Financing Volume
The volume of our retail and lease contracts, which are acquired primarily from Toyota and Lexus dealers, is substantially dependent upon TMNA new sales volume, the level of TMNA sponsored subvention and other incentive programs, as well as TMCC competitive rate and other incentive programs.  Despite lower levels of subvention, our financing volume increased 11 percent and 10 percent, and our market share increased approximately 4 percentage points and approximately 1 percentage point for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, as a result of TMNA and TMCC cash incentive programs and our other competitive rate programs.

55

 
The composition of our net earning assets is summarized below: 
 


 




1

Includes wholesale and other credit arrangements in which we participate as part of a syndicate of lenders.
Retail Contract Volume and Earning Assets
Despite lower levels of subvention, our new retail contract volume increased 15 percent and 14 percent for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, as a result of other competitive rate and cash incentive programs. 
Our retail finance receivables, net increased 7 percent at December 31, 2019 as compared to March 31, 2019 due to an increase in retail contract volume and in the average amount financed.
Lease Contract Volume and Earning Assets
Our lease contract volume decreased 5 percent and 6 percent for the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower levels of subvention.  Our investments in operating leases, net, decreased 1 percent at December 31, 2019, as compared to March 31, 2019 due to decreased lease contract volume.
Dealer Financing and Earning Assets
Dealer financing, net decreased 4 percent at December 31, 2019 as compared to March 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in dealer inventory outstanding.
56

 
Residual Value Risk
The primary factors affecting our exposure to residual value risk are the levels at which residual values are established at lease inception, current economic conditions and outlook, projected end-of-term market values, and the resulting impact on depreciation expense and lease return rates.  Higher average operating lease units outstanding and the resulting increase in maturities, a higher supply of used vehicles, as well as deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, and depreciation expense.
On a quarterly basis, we review the estimated end-of-term market values of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of our carrying values.  To the extent the estimated end-of-term market value of a leased vehicle is lower than the residual value established at lease inception, the residual value of the leased vehicle is adjusted downward so that the carrying value at lease end will approximate the estimated end-of-term market value.  For investments in operating leases, adjustments are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining terms of the lease contracts and are included in Depreciation on operating leases in our Consolidated Statements of Income as a change in accounting estimate.
Depreciation on Operating Leases
Depreciation on operating leases and average operating lease units outstanding are as follows:
 


 
Depreciation expense on operating leases decreased 4 percent during the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, due to lower expectations of residual value losses on our more recent originations and lower average operating units outstanding.  Depreciation expense on operating leases remained relatively unchanged during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, as the decrease from lower average operating units outstanding was mostly offset by higher residual value losses.  
57

 
Credit Risk
Credit Loss Experience
Our credit loss experience may be affected by a number of factors including the economic environment, our purchasing, servicing and collections practices, used vehicle market conditions and subvention.  Changes in the economy that impact the consumer such as increasing interest rates, and a rise in the unemployment rate as well as higher debt balances, coupled with deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values, could increase our credit losses.  In addition, a decline in the effectiveness of our collection practices could also increase our credit losses.  We continuously evaluate and refine our purchasing practices and collection efforts to minimize risk.  In addition, subvention contributes to our overall portfolio quality, as subvened contracts typically have higher credit quality than non-subvened contracts.
The following table provides information related to our credit loss experience:
 


 




1

Net charge-off and default frequency ratios have been annualized using nine months results for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.




2

Average loss per unit upon disposition of repossessed vehicles or charge-off prior to repossession.




3 

Substantially all retail and operating lease receivables do not involve recourse to the dealer in the event of customer default.




4 

Includes accounts in bankruptcy and excludes accounts for which vehicles have been repossessed.
The level of credit losses primarily reflects two factors: default frequency and loss severity.  Net charge-offs as a percentage of average gross earning assets remained unchanged at 0.33 percent at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.  Default frequency as a percentage of outstanding contracts decreased to 1.21 percent for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to 1.44 percent in the same period in fiscal 2019, primarily due to a continued focus on late stage collection activities.  During fiscal 2020, we implemented new strategies which require additional time and effort to analyze and process vehicle total loss accounts in an effort to optimize insurance collections. Implementation of the new process has temporarily increased our delinquency rates and impacted our default frequency and average loss severity. Our average loss severity for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 increased to $7,884 from $7,155 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the new strategies discussed above as well as higher average amounts financed.  Our aggregate balances for accounts 60 or more days past due were 0.43 percent for December 31, 2019, compared to 0.38 percent at December 31, 2018, but have increased from 0.31 percent at March 31, 2019, as a result of the new strategies discussed above along with our typical seasonal pattern for delinquency.  
58

 
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable and estimable losses as of the balance sheet date resulting from the non-performance of our customers and dealers under their contractual obligations.  The determination of the allowance for credit losses involves significant assumptions, complex analyses, and management judgment.
The allowance for credit losses for our consumer portfolio is established through a process that estimates probable losses incurred as of the balance sheet date based upon consistently applied statistical analyses of portfolio data.  This process utilizes delinquency migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, and incorporates current and expected trends and other relevant factors, including used vehicle market conditions, economic conditions, unemployment rates, purchase quality mix, and operational factors.  This process, along with management judgment, is used to establish the allowance for credit losses to cover probable and estimable losses incurred as of the balance sheet date.  Movement in any of these factors would cause changes in estimated probable losses.
The allowance for credit losses for our dealer portfolio is established by aggregating dealer financing receivables into loan-risk pools, which are determined based on the risk characteristics of the loan (e.g. secured by vehicles, real estate or dealership assets).  We analyze the loan-risk pools using internally developed risk ratings for each dealer.  In addition, we have established procedures that focus on managing high risk loans in our dealer portfolio.  Our field operations management and special assets group are consulted each quarter to determine if any specific dealer loan is considered impaired.  If impaired loans are identified, specific reserves are established, as appropriate, and the loan is removed from the loan-risk pool for separate monitoring.
The following table provides information related to our allowance for credit losses:
 
 


 
Our allowance for credit losses remained relatively unchanged at $595 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $596 million at December 31, 2018, as our net charge-off experience was relatively consistent.  Future changes in the economy that impact the consumer such as increasing interest rates and a rise in the unemployment rate as well as higher debt balances, coupled with deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values, could result in increases to our allowance for credit losses.  In addition, a decline in the effectiveness of our collection practices could also increase our allowance for credit losses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity risk is the risk relating to our ability to meet our financial obligations when they come due.  Our liquidity strategy is to ensure that we maintain the ability to fund assets and repay liabilities in a timely and cost-effective manner, even in adverse market conditions.  Our strategy includes raising funds via the global capital markets and through loans, credit facilities, and other transactions as well as generating liquidity from our earning assets.  This strategy has led us to develop a diversified borrowing base that is distributed across a variety of markets, geographies, investors and financing structures. 
Liquidity management involves forecasting and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our cash needs, including unanticipated events.  To ensure adequate liquidity through a full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility and diversity.  Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on developing and maintaining direct relationships with commercial paper investors and wholesale market funding providers, and maintaining the ability to sell certain assets when and if conditions warrant.
We develop and maintain contingency funding plans and regularly evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances, allowing us to assess how we will be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of capital is constrained.  The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, and outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period. In addition, we monitor the ratings and credit exposure of the lenders that participate in our credit facilities to ascertain any issues that may arise with potential draws on these facilities if that contingency becomes warranted.
We maintain broad access to a variety of domestic and global markets and may choose to realign our funding activities depending upon market conditions, relative costs, and other factors.  We believe that our funding sources, combined with operating and investing activities, provide sufficient liquidity to meet future funding requirements and business growth.  For liquidity purposes, we hold cash in excess of our immediate funding needs.  These excess funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid and investment grade money market instruments as well as certain available-for-sale debt securities, which provide liquidity for our short-term funding needs and flexibility in the use of our other funding sources.  We maintained excess funds ranging from $3.9 billion to $7.7 billion with an average balance of $6.5 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2019.  The amount of excess funds we hold may fluctuate, depending on market conditions and other factors.  We also have access to liquidity under the $5.0 billion credit facility with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. (“TMS”), which is further described in Note 7 – Debt and Credit Facilities of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We believe we have sufficient capacity to meet our short-term funding requirements and manage our liquidity.
Credit support is provided to us by our indirect parent Toyota Financial Services Corporation (“TFSC”), and, in turn to TFSC by TMC.  Taken together, these credit support agreements provide an additional source of liquidity to us, although we do not rely upon such credit support in our liquidity planning and capital and risk management.  The credit support agreements are not a guarantee by TMC or TFSC of any securities or obligations of TFSC or TMCC, respectively.  The fees paid pursuant to these agreements are disclosed in Note 11 – Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
TMC’s obligations under its credit support agreement with TFSC rank pari passu with TMC’s senior unsecured debt obligations.  Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.
We routinely monitor global financial conditions and our financial exposure to our global counterparties, particularly in those countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal or political strain and the corresponding likelihood of default.  We do not currently have exposure to sovereign counterparties in countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal or political strain or any other sovereign counterparties.  Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit” section and “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - The failure or commercial soundness of our counterparties and other financial institutions may have an effect on our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition” in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.

Unsecured notes and loans payable
The following table summarizes the significant activities by program of our Unsecured notes and loans payable:
 






1

Changes in Commercial paper are shown net due to its short duration within Issuances.  
Commercial Paper
Short-term funding needs are met through the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S.  Commercial paper outstanding under our commercial paper programs ranged from approximately $26.8 billion to $28.7 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, with an average outstanding balance of $27.9 billion.  Our commercial paper programs are supported by the liquidity facilities discussed under the heading “Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit.”  We believe we have sufficient capacity to meet our short-term funding requirements and manage our liquidity.
MTN program
We maintain a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to provide for the issuance of debt securities in the U.S. capital markets to retail and institutional investors. We qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules, which allows us to issue under our registration statement an unlimited amount of debt securities during the three year period ending January 2021.  Debt securities issued under the U.S. shelf registration statement are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture which requires TMCC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge and cross-default provisions.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants.
 
 

61

 
EMTN program
Our EMTN program, shared with our affiliates Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands) B.V., Toyota Credit Canada Inc. and Toyota Finance Australia Limited (TMCC and such affiliates, the “EMTN Issuers”), provides for the issuance of debt securities in the international capital markets.  In September 2019, the EMTN Issuers renewed the EMTN program for a one year period.  The maximum aggregate principal amount authorized under the EMTN Program to be outstanding at any time is €50.0 billion or the equivalent in other currencies, of which €17.8 billion was available for issuance at December 31, 2019.  The authorized amount is shared among all EMTN Issuers.  The authorized aggregate principal amount under the EMTN program may be increased from time to time.  Debt securities issued under the EMTN program are issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement.  Certain debt securities issued under the EMTN program are subject to negative pledge provisions.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants. 
We may issue other debt securities through the global capital markets or enter into other unsecured financing arrangements, including those in which we agree to use the proceeds solely to acquire retail or lease contracts financing new Toyota and Lexus vehicles of specified “green” models.  The terms of these “green” bond transactions are consistent with the terms of other similar transactions except that the proceeds we receive are included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, when applicable.
Other debt
TMCC has entered into term loan agreements with various banks.  These term loan agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants and conditions.
We may borrow from affiliates on terms based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative cost of funds, and market access capabilities.

62

 
Secured notes and loans payable
Asset-backed securitization of our earning asset portfolio provides us with an alternative source of funding.  We regularly execute public or private securitization transactions.  
The following table summarizes the significant activities of our Secured notes and loans payable:


We securitize finance receivables and beneficial interests in investments in operating leases (“Securitized Assets”) using a variety of structures.  Our securitization transactions involve the transfer of Securitized Assets to bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities.  These bankruptcy-remote entities are used to ensure that the Securitized Assets are isolated from the claims of creditors of TMCC and that the cash flows from these assets are available solely for the benefit of the investors in these asset-backed securities.  Investors in asset-backed securities do not have recourse to our other assets, and neither TMCC nor our affiliates guarantee these obligations.  We are not required to repurchase or make reallocation payments with respect to the Securitized Assets that become delinquent or default after securitization.  As seller and servicer of the Securitized Assets, we are required to repurchase or make a reallocation payment with respect to the underlying assets that are subsequently discovered not to have met specified eligibility requirements.  This repurchase obligation is customary in securitization transactions.  With the exception of our revolving asset-backed securitization program, funding obtained from our securitization transactions is repaid as the underlying Securitized Assets amortize.
We service the Securitized Assets in accordance with our customary servicing practices and procedures.  Our servicing duties include collecting payments on Securitized Assets and submitting them to a trustee for distribution to security holders and other interest holders.  We prepare monthly servicer certificates on the performance of the Securitized Assets, including collections, investor distributions, delinquencies, and credit losses.  We also perform administrative services for the special purpose entities.
Our use of special purpose entities in securitizations is consistent with conventional practice in the securitization market.  None of our officers, directors, or employees hold any equity interests or receive any direct or indirect compensation from our special purpose entities.  These entities do not own our stock or the stock of any of our affiliates.  Each special purpose entity has a limited purpose and generally is permitted only to purchase assets, issue asset-backed securities, and make payments to the security holders, other interest holders and certain service providers as required under the terms of the transactions.

63

 
Our securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancement to reduce the risk of loss to security holders and other interest holders in the asset-backed securities.  Credit enhancement may include some or all of the following:




 

•

Overcollateralization:  The principal of the Securitized Assets that exceeds the principal amount of the related secured debt.




 

•

Excess spread:  The expected interest collections on the Securitized Assets that exceed the expected fees and expenses of the special purpose entity, including the interest payable on the debt, net of swap settlements, if any.




 

•

Cash reserve funds:  A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of asset-backed securities may be held by the securitization trust in a segregated reserve fund and may be used to pay principal and interest to security holders and other interest holders if collections on the underlying receivables are insufficient.




 

•

Yield supplement arrangements:  Additional overcollateralization may be provided to supplement the future contractual interest payments from securitized receivables with relatively low contractual interest rates.




 

•

Subordinated notes:  The subordination of principal and interest payments on subordinated notes may provide additional credit enhancement to holders of senior notes.
In addition to the credit enhancement described above, we may enter into interest rate swaps with our special purpose entities that issue variable rate debt.  Under the terms of these swaps, the special purpose entities are obligated to pay TMCC a fixed rate of interest on payment dates in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on notional amounts equal to the outstanding balance of the secured notes and loans payable.  This arrangement enables the special purpose entities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in issuing variable rate debt that is secured by fixed rate Securitized Assets.
Securitized Assets and the related debt remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We recognize financing revenue on the Securitized Assets.  We also recognize interest expense on the secured notes and loans payable issued by the special purpose entities and maintain an allowance for credit losses on the Securitized Assets to cover estimated probable credit losses using a methodology consistent with that used for our non-securitized asset portfolio.  The interest rate swaps between TMCC and the special purpose entities are considered intercompany transactions and therefore are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
We periodically enter into term securitization transactions whereby we agree to use the proceeds solely to acquire retail and lease contracts financing new Toyota and Lexus vehicles of certain specified “green” models.  The terms of these “green” securitization transactions are consistent with the terms of our other similar transactions except that the proceeds we receive are included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, when applicable.
In June 2019, we completed an offering of secured notes under a new revolving asset-backed securitization program, backed by a revolving pool of finance receivables and cash collateral. Cash flows from these receivables during the revolving period in excess of what is needed to pay certain expenses of the securitization trust and contractual interest payments on the related secured notes may be used to purchase additional receivables, provided that certain conditions are met following the purchase.  The secured notes feature a scheduled five year revolving period, with the ability to repay the secured notes in full, after which an amortization period begins. The revolving period may also end with the amortization period beginning upon the occurrence of certain events that include certain segregated account balances falling below their required levels, credit losses or delinquencies on the pool of assets supporting the secured notes exceeding specified levels, the adjusted pool balance falling to less than 50% of the initial principal amount of the secured notes, or interest not being paid on the secured notes. 
Public Securitization
We maintain a shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide for the issuance of securities backed by Securitized Assets in the U.S. capital markets during the three year period ending December 2021.  We regularly sponsor public securitization trusts that issue securities backed by retail finance receivables, including registered securities that we retain.  None of these securities have defaulted, experienced any events of default or failed to pay principal in full at maturity.  As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, we did not have any outstanding lease securitization transactions registered with the SEC.

Credit Facilities and Letters of Credit
For additional liquidity purposes, we maintain credit facilities as described below:
364 Day Credit Agreement, Three Year Credit Agreement and Five Year Credit Agreement
In November 2019, TMCC, Toyota Credit de Puerto Rico Corp. (“TCPR”) and other Toyota affiliates entered into a $5.0 billion 364 day syndicated bank credit facility, a $5.0 billion three year syndicated bank credit facility and a $5.0 billion five year syndicated bank credit facility, expiring in fiscal 2021, 2023, and 2025, respectively.
The ability to make draws is subject to covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These agreements may be used for general corporate purposes and none were drawn upon as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019.  We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above.
Other Unsecured Credit Agreements
TMCC has entered into additional unsecured credit facilities with various banks.  As of December 31, 2019, TMCC had committed bank credit facilities totaling $4.6 billion of which $150 million, $2.4 billion, $75 million, and $2.0 billion mature in fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.
These credit agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These credit facilities were not drawn upon as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above.
TMCC is party to a $5.0 billion three year revolving credit facility with TMS, an affiliate, expiring in fiscal 2022. This credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes and was not drawn upon as of December 31, 2019.
From time to time, we may borrow from affiliates based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative costs of funds, and market access capabilities.
Credit Ratings
The cost and availability of unsecured financing is influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation.  Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets.  Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating organization.  Each credit rating organization may have different criteria for evaluating risk, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each organization.  Our credit ratings depend in part on the existence of the credit support agreements of TFSC and TMC.  Refer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on the credit ratings of TMCC and its parent companies and our credit support arrangements” in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Risk Management Strategy
Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and variable rate debt, denominated in U.S. dollars and various other currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables.  We enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, and foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities.  Our use of derivative transactions is intended to reduce long-term fluctuations in the fair value of assets and liabilities caused by market movements.  All of our derivative activities are authorized and monitored by our management and our Asset-Liability Committee which provides a framework for financial controls and governance to manage market risk.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net settle asset and liability positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  The derivative instruments are included as a component of Other assets or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The accounting guidance permits the net presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.  When we meet this condition, we elect to present such balances on a net basis.  
Our International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreements are our master netting agreements which permit multiple transactions to be cancelled and settled with a single net balance paid to either party.  The master netting agreements also contain reciprocal collateral agreements which require the transfer of cash collateral to the party in a net asset position across all transactions.  Our collateral agreements with substantially all our counterparties include a zero threshold, full collateralization arrangement.  Although we have daily valuation and collateral exchange arrangements with all of our counterparties, due to the time required to move collateral, there may be a delay of up to one day between the exchange of collateral and the valuation of our derivatives.  We would not be required to post additional collateral to the counterparties with whom we were in a net liability position at December 31, 2019, if our credit ratings were to decline, since we fully collateralize without regard to credit ratings with these counterparties.  In addition, as our collateral agreements include legal right of offset provisions, collateral amounts are netted against derivative assets or derivative liabilities.
We categorize derivatives as those designated for hedge accounting (“hedge accounting derivatives”) and those that are not designated for hedge accounting (“non-hedge accounting derivatives”).  At the inception of a derivative contract, we may elect to designate a derivative as a hedge accounting derivative.  As of December 31, 2019, we had no hedge accounting derivatives.
Refer to Note 6 – Derivatives, Hedging Activities and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Assets and Liabilities
The following table summarizes our derivative assets and liabilities, which are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets:


Collateral represents cash received or deposited under reciprocal arrangements that we have entered into with our derivative counterparties.  As of December 31, 2019, we held excess collateral of $9 million which we did not use to offset derivative assets, and we posted excess collateral of $40 million which we did not use to offset derivative liabilities.  As of March 31, 2019, we held excess collateral of $2 million, which we did not use to offset derivative assets, and we posted excess collateral of $17 million which we did not use to offset derivative liabilities.  
LIBOR TRANSITION
In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after calendar year 2021.  We have exposures to LIBOR-based financial instruments, including through our dealer financing activities, derivative contracts, secured and unsecured debt, and investment securities.  To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates (“ARRs”), we have established an initiative led by senior management, with Board and committee oversight, to assess, monitor and mitigate risks associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, to achieve operational readiness and engage impacted borrowers and counterparties in connection with the transition to ARRs.  Our efforts under this initiative include monitoring developments and the usage of ARRs, monitoring the regulatory and financial reporting guidance, as well as reviewing and updating current legal contracts, internal systems and processes to accommodate the use of ARRs.  
Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices” in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K for further discussion.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We have omitted this section pursuant to General Instruction H(2) of Form 10-Q.
 
 
ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).  Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules, regulations, and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
 
 
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Litigation
Various legal actions, governmental proceedings and other claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  Certain of these actions are or purport to be class action suits, seeking sizeable damages and/or changes in our business operations, policies and practices.  In addition, we are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, and investigations from time to time at the state and federal levels.  It is inherently difficult to predict the course of such legal actions and governmental inquiries. Certain of these actions are similar to suits that have been filed against other financial institutions and captive finance companies.  We perform periodic reviews of pending claims and actions to determine the probability of adverse verdicts and resulting amounts of liability.  We establish accruals for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  When we are able, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability.  Refer to Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Given the inherent uncertainty associated with legal matters, the actual costs of resolving legal claims and associated costs of defense may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts for which accruals have been established.  Based on available information and established accruals, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the results of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
