NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
 
Aura Systems, Inc., (“Aura”, “We”
or the “Company”) a Delaware corporation, was founded to engage in the development, commercialization, and sales of
products, systems, and components, using its patented and proprietary electromagnetic technology. Aura develops and sells AuraGen®
axial flux mobile induction power systems to the industrial, commercial, and defense mobile power generation markets. In
addition, the Company has also developed and patented High Force Electromagnetic Linear Actuators which it has sold in prior years.
 
NOTE 2 – ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Accounting principles
 
In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance
sheets and related interim statements of income and comprehensive income, and cash flows include all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Company’s Amended
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended February 28, 2019 filed on October 24, 2019 with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a
lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic
842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right
to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company evaluated the impact of the
adoption of Topic 842 effective for the nine-months ended November 30, 2019 and the impact was none on the Condensed Financial
Statements.
 
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 606. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes principles for reporting information about
the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods
or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods
or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.
 
The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance
by performing the following five steps analysis:
 
Step 1: Identify the
contract
 
Step 2: Identify the
performance obligations
 
Step 3: Determine the
transaction price
 
Step 4: Allocate the
transaction price
 
Step 5: Recognize revenue

Re-classifications
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the comparative
financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. The balance sheet as of February 28, 2019, presented herein,
includes a reclassification of $1,008,328 for accrued expense in relation to a related party obligation from accrued expenses to
a separate caption accrued expenses-related party.
 
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. During the nine months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company
reported net income of $583,657 and a loss of $3,715,207, respectively, and had negative cash flows from operating activities of
$490,578 and $1,902,151, respectively. During the three-months ended November 30, 2019, the Company recorded a non-recurring gain
to other income on the Statement of Operations of approximately $1.9 million consisting of the cancellation of accounts payable
of $0.3 million, cancellation of customer advances of $0.4 million and cancellation of unpaid wages and salaries of $1.5 million.
In addition, approximately $1.0 million of unpaid compensation owed to a former CEO and a related party was cancelled and accounted
for as a capital transaction and reclassified from accrued expense-related party to additional paid-in-capital. These amounts were
incurred in prior years and were cancelled as the related statute of limitations periods have since expired. The Company reclassified
in the three-months ended November 30, 2019 approximately $0.3 million related to the shares issued to the Company’s president
in August 2019 as other expense (see Note 5).
 
If the Company is unable to generate profits on a sustained
basis and is unable to continue to obtain financing for its working capital requirements, it may have to curtail its business sharply
or cease business altogether.
 
Substantial additional capital resources will be required
to fund continuing expenditures related to our research, development, manufacturing and business development activities. The Company’s
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely
basis, to retain its current financing, to obtain additional financing, and ultimately to attain profitability.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal year
2020, we increased operations of our AuraGen®/VIPER business and during the second and third quarters of
fiscal 2020, the Company recognized approximately $745,000 in revenue as compared to approximately $39,000 of revenue in the
nine-month period ended November 30, 2018. We plan to lease or acquire a new facility of approximately 50,000 square feet to
support operations sometime during the next six months.

2019, the principle and accrued interest owed to Messrs. Howsmon and Diaz, respectively, in the amounts of $4,500 and $2,079, respectively,
were settled by the issuance of 32,895 shares of common stock to each person by applying a price of $0.20 per share.
 
In February 2018, the Company
issued 192,641 shares of its common stock to Steven Veen in satisfaction of $267,000 in debt. Despite this issuance, Mr. Veen claims
to continue to be entitled to repayment of the $267,000 debt. Mr. Veen has, to-date, not surrendered the shares issued to him in
fulfillment of the debt he claims to be still owed and continues to own the 192,641 shares as of the date of this filing. The Company’s
new management team is in the process of investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Veen.

On January 30, 2017 the Company entered into an agreement
entitled First Amendment to Transaction Documents with five of seven secured creditors holding a security interest in all of the
Company’s assets except for its patents and other intellectual properties. These creditors are the seven listed above under
Convertible Debt and include the following: Kenmont Capital Partners, LPD Investments, Guenther, Dresner, Lempert and Mr. M. Abdou
and Mr. W. Abdou. All of the creditors entered into the January 30, 2017 agreement with the exception of the Messrs. Abdou. The
original agreement dated May 7, 2013 provided that if at least 75% of the stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes
votes to amend the agreement and/or waive any conditions or defaults, then any such amendments or waivers shall be binding on all
secured creditors. The five secured creditors signing the amendment total in excess of 95% of the issuable stock upon conversion
and, therefore the agreement is binding on all seven of the secured creditors. The agreement provided that all accrued and unpaid
interest will be added to the principal amount. The amended note provided for no interest from November 1, 2016 to February 14,
2018, the date at which the 1-for-7 reverse stock split became effective at which time 80% of the total debt including accrued
interest was converted into shares of common stock and a new five year 5% per annum convertible note was issued for the remainder.
The new amended and restated senior convertible notes have a maturity date of January 30, 2022. The five creditors and the Company
entered into a Second Amendment to Transaction Documents on March 14, 2017 and a Third Amendment to Transaction Documents on April
8, 2017, both of which extended the required date of the stockholder approval of the 1-for-7 reverse stock split, which was completed
on February 14, 2018. The amended and restated senior convertible notes also require the Company to make a “Required Cash
Payment” as defined in the agreement if the Company receives at least $4,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale
of equity securities (including securities convertible into equity securities) of the Company in one or a series of related transactions.
The Required Cash Payment is equal to the current outstanding balance of the notes, which was $1,092,542 at November 30, 2019,
plus any outstanding accrued interest.

NOTE 5 – ACCRUED EXPENSES
 
Accrued expenses consisted of the following:
 

 
Accrued payroll and related expenses consist primarily
of salaries and vacation time accrued but not paid to employees due to our lack of financial resources. During the third quarter
of fiscal 2020, approximately $1.5 million of unpaid salaries and related expenses were reclassified as other income on the statement
of operations for the three-months ended November 30, 2019 as the related statute of limitations periods have expired. Also, on
August 28, 2019, the board approved a stock issuance of 1,030,385 to Cipora Lavut, the Company’s President, at a fair value
of $329,723, for full satisfaction of prior amounts owed to her for unpaid salaries up to August 28, 2019. This amount was recorded
as a reduction of accrued payroll expense in the second quarter but determined in the third quarter of 2020 to be an offset (other
expense) to the gain amount of $1.5 million.
 
NOTE 6 – INVENTORY 
 
During fiscal 2019 and at February 28, 2019, the Company
fully reserved its usable inventory on the basis that production and revenues during the fiscal years 2017 to 2019 were nil and
future production requirements were uncertain. During fiscal 2020, the Company has increased production of its AuraGen product
and has generated approximately $745,000 in current year revenues. As a result, the Company recognized approximately $53,000 of
inventory on its balance sheet as of November 30, 2019 consisting of $44,500 of raw materials, $4,600 of work in process and $3,900
of finished goods inventory.

Cipora Lavut of $329,723, 168,475 shares were issued to three persons in settlement of $33,660 of debt principle and accrued interest,

million in unpaid compensation due to expiration of the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the Company accounted for this transaction
as a capital transaction and reclassified the amount to additional paid-in-capital.
 
During the six months ended August 31, 2018 (restated),
the Company issued 7,364,735 shares of common stock, valued at $2,280,964, in fulfillment of a contractual obligation owed to BetterSea,
LLC. The number of shares issued was based on the then-outstanding closing quote of the stock. The issuance of the shares was previously
reported by the Company. The Company also paid $20,000 in legal fees related to legal expense associated with the Company’s
delays in the issuance of the stock.
 
During the nine months ended November 30, 2018, the
Company issued 742,857 warrants to a member of its board of directors. The warrants have a term of five years and an exercise price
of $1.40. The Company recorded an expense of $312,072 for the issuance of these warrants. During the nine months ended November
30, 2018, the Company re-priced to $1.40 all outstanding employee stock options and warrants that had a previous exercise price
greater than $1.40. The Company recorded an expense of $105,352 as a result of the re-pricing.

of the board of directors, Messrs. Diaz-Verson and Lempert, agreed to cancel their outstanding debt with the Company in the amounts
of $6,579 and $20,500, respectively, in exchange for 32,895 and 102,503 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.20 per
share. On the dates of the exchange, November 26 and November 27, 2019, respectively, the closing prices of the Company’s
common stock was $0.21 and $0.22 per share, respectively (see Note 4). The loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2,700
was recorded as part of additional paid-in-capital.
 
NOTE 9 – COMMITMENTS &
CONTINGENCIES
 
Leases
 
Our facilities consist of approximately 20,000 square
feet in Stanton, California and an additional storage facility in Santa Clarita, California. The Stanton facility is used for some
assembly and testing of AuraGen®/VIPER systems and is rented on a month-to-month basis. The rent for the Stanton
facility is $10,000 per month and the storage facility is an additional $5,000 per month, both on a month-to-month basis. Our current
Stanton facility is not sufficient to support the expected operations and the Company is evaluating new facility options to be
used for limited production, testing, warehousing and engineering, as well as needed office space for support staff. The Company
also rents temporary storage space on a month-to-month basis. Commencing in February 2019, the Company began renting approximately
300 square feet of office space in Irvine, California at a cost of $ 2,350 per month on a month-to-month basis. In July 2019, the
Company ceased renting this office space.

Following the adoption of Topic 842, Leases, as of
the start of fiscal year 2020, the Company determined that there was no impact on its Condensed Financial Statements during the
nine-month period ended November 30, 2019. The standard requires entities to evaluate all lease transactions including leases previously
classified as operating leases, and, if required under Topic 842, a right-to-use asset and a corresponding lease liability may
be recorded on the balance sheet in the period in which a lease commences.
 
Joint Venture
 
In March 2017 the Company entered into a joint venture
with a Chinese partner to form Jiangsu Shengfeng Mobile Power Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu Shengfeng”) to address
the Chinese market. Under the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture agreement, Aura owns 49% of the venture and our Chinese partner owns
51%. The Chinese partner is to contribute approximately $9.25 million to the venture –– principally in the form of
facilities and equipment as wells as approximately $500,000 in cash. The Company contributed to the venture in the form of $250,000
in cash as well as a limited license to the joint venture to manufacture, sell and service the AuraGen® products
within China. The limited license sold to the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture, however, does not permit Jiangsu Shengfeng to manufacture
the AuraGen® rotor; rather, the joint venture is required to purchase all rotor subassemblies as well as certain
software elements directly from the Company. Jiangsu Shengfeng’s board of directors consists of three members appointed by
the Company and three appointed by our Chinese partner; Jiangsu Shengfeng’s CEO is appointed by our Chinese partner while
its CFO and director for quality assurance and control are appointed by Aura.
 
In addition, Jiangsu Shengfeng is required to purchase
a minimum of $1,250,000 of product from the Company supported by letters of credit for distribution until their factory is built,
equipment installed, and staff hired and properly trained by Aura personnel. During fiscal 2019, Jiangsu Shengfeng placed a $1,000,000
order with the Company including a $700,000 advance payment. Aura has also committed to supply personnel for nine months at no
cost other than to be reimbursed for travel, room and board. This commitment has been fulfilled and Aura is under no further obligation
to supply personnel at no cost. The agreement was subject to the approval of the Chinese Government which was received in April
2017. Mr. Song, the majority shareholder of the Chinese partner of the joint venture, invested $2,000,000 in Aura’s common
shares at a price of $1.40 per share. On November 20, 2019, the Company reached a preliminary agreement with Jiangsu Shengfeng,
the Company’s Chinese joint venture regarding the return of $700,000 previously advanced to the Company in September 2018
and previously recorded as a customer advance on the balance sheet as of February 28, 2019. The preliminary agreement reached consists
of a non-interest-bearing promissory note and a payment plan pursuant to which the $700,000 is paid over a 12-month period beginning
March 15, 2020 and February 15, 2021. In the balance sheet as of November 30, 2019, the amount of $700,000 was reclassified to
notes payable.
 
Contingencies
 
We are subject to the legal proceedings and claims
discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually and in the
aggregate and evaluates potential losses on such litigation if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable. However,
the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Although management
considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company
for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting
period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters subsequent to year end that did not individually
or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.
 
In 2017, the Company’s former COO was awarded
approximately $238,000 in accrued salary and related charges by the California labor board. The Company believes that this award
does not reflect the amount owed which is significantly lower and is exploring all its options and available remedies and is working
toward an offer to settle this matter.
  
The Company is presently engaged in a dispute with
one of its former directors, Robert Kopple, relating to approximately $10 million and approximately 3.15 million warrants which
Mr. Kopple claims to be owed to him and his affiliates by the Company. In July 2017, Mr. Kopple filed suit against the Company
as well as against current director Mr. Diaz-Verson and former directors Mr. Breslow and Mr. Howsmon, as well as Mr. Gagerman,
the former CEO (not a director) in connection with these allegations. In 2018, the Court sustained demurrers by Mr. Diaz-Verson,
Mr. Breslow, Mr. Howsmon and Mr. Gagerman and as a result of these successful demurrers, all four of these defendants have been
dismissed from the suit. While the Company believes that it has certain valid defenses in these matters, the Company is currently
in settlement discussions with Mr. Kopple.

In April 2018, the Company filed suit against its former
counsel, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP alleging various acts of malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty committed by
the firm in connection with its representation of Aura. In June 2018, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP filed a cross-complaint
against the Company claiming in excess of $400,000 in allegedly unpaid legal fees. In January 2019, the Company reached a settlement
with Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, pursuant to which, among other things, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP agreed
to dismiss its cross-complaint and waive all unpaid legal fees. The action and the cross-complaint were both subsequently dismissed.
 
In February 2018, the Company failed to issue shares
of stock contractually owed to BetterSea, LLC. On August 15, 2018, 7,364,735 restricted shares were issued in fulfillment of this
contractual obligation based on the then-outstanding closing quote of the stock. The issuance of the shares was previously reported
by the Company. The Company also paid $20,000 in legal fees related to legal expense associated with the Company’s delays
in the issuance of the stock.
 
In May 2018, Shelley Scholnick dba JB Transporters
brought suit against the Company claiming ongoing fees in excess of $52,000 owed for the storage of the Company’s property.
Notably, in June 2017, the Company had brought suit against J.B. Moving & Delivery, a business operated and controlled by a
relative of Scholnick, Jacob Binstok, for damages suffered by the Company as a result of the defendant’s improper storage
of the Company’s property and improper refusal to return such property. In 2018, the Company successfully received a judgment
against J.B. Moving & Delivery in the amount of approximately $114,000. The Company disputes that any amount is now owed to
Scholnick.
 
On March 26, 2019, various stockholders of the Company
controlling a combined total of more than 27.5 million shares delivered a signed written consent to the Company removing Ronald
Buschur as a member of the Company’s Board and electing Cipora Lavut as a director of the Company.  On March 27, 2019,
those same stockholders delivered a further signed written consent to the Company removing William Anderson and Si Ryong Yu as
members of the Company’s Board and electing Robert Lempert and David Mann as directors of the Company. These written consents
represented a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of March 26, 2019 and March 27,
2019, respectively. Because of Aura’s refusal to recognize the legal effectiveness of the consents, on April 8, 2019
the stockholders filed suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General
Corporations Law, seeking an order confirming the validity of the consents and declaring that Aura’s Board consists of Ms. Lavut,
Mr. Mann, Mr. Lempert, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Diaz-Versón, Jr. On July 8, 2019 the Court of Chancery
entered final judgment in favor of the stockholder plaintiffs, confirming that (a) Ronald Buschur, Si Ryong Yu and William Anderson
had been validly removed by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock acting by written consent (b) Ms.
Lavut, Mr. Mann and Mr. Lempert had been validly elected by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock
acting by written consent, and (c) the Company’s Board of Directors validly consists of Cipora Lavut, David Mann, Robert
Lempert, Gary Douglas and Salvador Diaz-Versón, Jr.

Overview
 
Beginning with fiscal 2017 through 2018, we reduced
our engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations and minimizing
expenditures while we attempted to raise additional funding and pursue some initial engineering activities 
 
In fiscal 2018, we successfully eliminated approximately
68% of our total indebtedness. Specifically, our secured creditors converted approximately $5.73 million of secured debt into approximately
4.1 million shares of our common stock. The converted debt represented approximately 80% of the total secured debt of the Company.
The balance of the secured debt (approximately $960,000) is to be paid to the secured creditors in cash if we raise at least $4.0
million in proceeds through new equity offerings in one or a series of related offerings. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, approximately
$12.77 million of unsecured debt was converted into approximately 9.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock and approximately
$12.3 million of unsecured debt was forgiven. In total, during fiscal 2018, we eliminated a total of approximately $30.23 million
of debt.
 
As of the date of this filing, Robert Kopple, our former
Vice Chairman of the Board, is the only significant unsecured note holder that has not agreed to restructure his debt. Mr. Kopple
claims that he and his affiliates are owed approximately $10.3 million on terms significantly preferable to other similarly situated
unsecured creditors. We dispute Mr. Kopple’s claims. See “Part II-Other Information, Item 1. Legal Proceedings”
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding the dispute with Mr. Kopple regarding these
transactions. Mr. Kopple has not accepted our numerous offers to restructure this debt.
 
During the three-months ended November 30, 2019, we
recorded a one-time gain to other income on the Statement of Operations of approximately $1.9 million consisting of the cancellation
of accounts payable of $0.3 million, cancellation of customer advances of $0.4 million and cancellation of unpaid wages and salaries
of $1.5 million. In addition, $1.0 million of unpaid compensation owed to a former CEO and a related party was cancelled and accounted
for as a capital transaction and reclassified from accrued expense-related party to additional paid-in-capital. These amounts were
incurred in prior years and were cancelledas the related statue of limitation periods have since expired. The Company reclassified
in the three-months ended November 30, 2019 approximately $0.3 million related to the shares issued to the Company’s president
in August 2019 as other expense (see Notes 3 and 7 to the Condensed Financial Statements).
 
On February 14, 2018, we effectuated a one-for-seven
reverse stock split.
 
In fiscal 2019, we began increasing our engineering
and manufacturing activities. We utilized contractors for these services in order to minimize our expense while we continued to
pursue new sources of financing. In July 2019, we began significantly increasing our sales, engineering, manufacturing and marketing
activities under our new management team.
 
Our business is based on the exploitation of our patented
mobile power solution known as the AuraGen® for commercial and industrial applications and the VIPER for military
applications. Our business model consists of two major components; (i) sales and marketing, (ii) design and engineering. 
 
(i) Our sales and marketing approaches are composed
of direct sales in North America and the use of agents, distributors and joint ventures for sales internationally. In North America,
our primary focus is in (a) mobile exportable power applications, (b) transport refrigeration, and (c) U.S. Military applications.
 
(ii) The second component of our business model is
focused on the design of new products and engineering support for the sales activities described above. The engineering support
consists of the introduction of new features for our AuraGen® solution such as higher power, different voltages,
three phase options, shore power systems, higher current solutions as well as interface kits for different platforms. Afterreducing
our engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations in fiscal
2018 and 2019, we expect modest engineering activities budgeted at approximately $200,000 during the fiscal 2020 year.
 


18
 

Operations.
 
During the first half of fiscal 2016, we significantly
reduced operations due to lack of financial resources. During the second half of fiscal 2016, our operations were further disrupted
when we were forced to move from our facilities in Redondo Beach, California to a smaller facility in Stanton, California. During
fiscal years 2017 to 2019, the Company reduced its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating
numerous financial obligations. During this time, our agreements with numerous customers, third party vendors, and organizations
and entities material to the operation of the Company business were canceled, delayed or terminated. During fiscal 2018, we successfully
restructured in excess of $30 million of debt. During fiscal 2019, we continued to address our financial needs, were able to ship
a small quantity of product during fiscal 2019 and shipped a small amount to customers and maintained a small inventory of finished
product. During the nine-months ended November 30, 2020, we increased production and recognized approximately $745,000 of revenue.
Our marketing strategy during fiscal 2020 includes the following key activities:
 
(i) One element of our business plan is focused on
electric transport refrigeration. The market is well understood and both social and economic forces are providing an unprecedented
opportunity to gain significant market share. Our immediate focus is on 20-k BTU/hr. midsize trucks and the 50-k BTU/hr. trailers.
 
(ii) Another element of our business plan is focused
on our mobile power solution for military applications around the globe.
 
(iii) We also plan to seek joint venture opportunities
similar to the agreement we entered in China to explore other international opportunities.
 
Going Concern.
 
Our independent auditor has expressed doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan,
raise capital and generate revenues (see Note 3 to the Condensed Financial Statements). See Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm on page F-1, together with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended
February 28, 2019 on Form 10-K/A issued on October 24, 2019.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our
financial conditions and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements
requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate
our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical
experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe
that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
606. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.
The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as
performance obligations are satisfied.
 
We have assessed the impact of the guidance by performing
the following five steps analysis: 
 
Step 1: Identify the contract
Step 2: Identify the
performance obligations
Step 3: Determine the
transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the
transaction price
Step 5: Recognize revenue


19
 

 
Inventory Valuation and Classification
 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market, on a standard cost basis. We review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess or obsolete
inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. We have minimally operated and therefore have only produced minimal product
since late 2015. As a result, while we believe that a portion of the inventory has value, we are unable to substantiate its demand
and market value and as a result we elected to fully reserve our inventory it in its entirety as of February 28, 2019. During fiscal
year 2020, we increased production and, accordingly, we have assigned a value of $53,000 to our physical and book inventory as
of November 30, 2019.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We account for stock-based compensation under the provisions
of FASB ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, which requires the measurement of all share-based payments
to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value-based method and the recording of such expense in
the consolidated statements of operations.
 
We account for stock option and warrant grants issued
and vesting to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50, “Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees”, whereas
the fair value of the equity-based compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at the earlier of either (a) the
date at which a performance commitment is reached or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity
instruments is complete.
 
For the past, several years and in accordance with
established public company accounting practice, we have consistently utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate
the fair value of stock options and warrants issued as compensation, primarily to management, employees, and directors. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model is a widely-accepted method of valuation that public companies typically utilize to calculate
the fair value of options and warrants that they issue in such circumstances.
 

Results of Operations
 
Nine-months ended November 30, 2019 compared to
nine-months ended November 30, 2018
 
Net revenues were $744,850 for the nine-months ended
November 30, 2019 (the “Nine-Months FY2020”) compared to $39,274 for the nine-months ended November 30, 2018 (the “Nine-Months
FY2019”), or an increase of 1,796% compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. During the second and third quarters of 2020,
we delivered 116 generator units to a distribution customer as compared to 6 units in the same period in the prior year for a military
application.
 
Cost of goods sold were $147,752 in the Nine-Months
FY2020 compared to $110,026 in the Nine-Months FY2019 resulting in a gross profit of $597,097 and a loss of $70,752, respectively,
and gross margins of 80.0% and negative 180.2%, respectively. Gross profit and related gross margin for the Nine-Months FY2020
shipments were high due to the utilization of inventory previously fully reserved. We do not expect gross margins above 80% to
continue for shipments of generator units in future quarters as the availability of usable parts from fully reserved inventory
will decline.
 
Engineering, research and development expenses were
$123,024 in the Nine-Months FY2020, compared to $302,293 in the Nine-Months FY2019, or a decline of 59.3%. Beginning fiscal 2021,
we expect to increase spend of research and development to include additional technical personnel, test and evaluation components,
capital equipment, larger space allocation to an annualized spend of $700,000.
 
Selling, general and administrative expense was $915,934
for the nine-months ended November 30, 2019 as compared to $2,797,711 during the comparable period of fiscal year 2019, or a decline
of $1,881,777 (67%). During Nine-Months FY2019, we incurred an expense of $417,000 related to the repricing of warrants and options,
$432,000 of higher legal expenses, higher consulting expense and administrative headcount cost.
 
Net interest expense in the Nine-Months FY2020 increased
$37,138 or 4%, to $885,731 from $848,593 in the Nine-Months FY2019.
 



20
 


 
Our net income for the Nine-Months FY2020 increased
$4,298,864, or 116%, to $583,657 from a net loss of $3,715, 207 in the Nine-Months FY2019 due primarily to (i) the recording of
a total of $1.9 million in gains, as compared to $0.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2018, on cancellation of accounts payables,
customer advances and unpaid salaries and related expenses following expiration of applicable statute of limitations periods (ii)
increased gross profit contribution of $0.7 million on higher levels of shipments and (iii) reduced operating expenses of $2.1
million.
 
Three months ended November 30, 2019 compared to
three months ended November 30, 2018
 
Net revenues were $396,775 for the three-months ended
November 30, 2019 (the “Three-Months FY2020”) compared to $0 for the three-months ended November 30, 2018 (the “Three-Months
FY2019”). During the second quarter of 2020, we delivered 64 generator units to a distribution customer as compared to 0
units in the same period in the prior year.
 
Cost of goods sold were $116,655 in the Three-Months
FY2020 compared to $37,032 in the Three-Months FY2019 resulting in a gross profit of $281,119 and a loss of $37,032, respectively,
and gross margins of 70.8% and a meaningless gross margin, respectively. Gross profit and related gross margin for the Three-Months
FY2020 shipments were high due to the utilization of inventory previously fully reserved. We do not expect gross margins above
80% to continue for shipments of generator units in future quarters as the availability of usable parts from fully reserved inventory
will decline.
 
Engineering, research and development expenses were
$30,472 in the Three-Months FY2020, compared to $138,417 in the Three-Months FY2019, or a decrease of 78%
 
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased
$383,000 (48%) to $407,652 in the Three-Months FY2020 from $790,985 in the Three-Months FY2019. During Three-Months FY2020, we
incurred less cost for administrative headcount and consultancy cost by $250,000 and $150,000 in reduced legal fees.
 
Net interest expense in the Three-Months FY2020 decreased
$11,293 or 4%, to $283,928 from $295,221 in the Three-Months FY2019.
 
Net income for the Three-Months FY2020 increased $2,780,761,
or 212%, to $1,470,317 from a loss of $1,310,444 in the Three-Months FY2019 due primarily to (i) the recording of a total of $1.9
million in gains on cancellation of accounts payables, customer advances and unpaid salaries and related expenses following expiration
of the applicable statute of limitation periods (ii) increased gross profit contribution of $0.3 million on higher levels of shipments
(iii) reduced operating expenses of $0.5 million and (iv) other expense of $0.1 million.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended
November 30, 2019, was $490,578, a decrease of $1,411,573 from the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided
by financing activities during the nine-months ended November 30, 2019, was $255,245 consisting of (i) cash proceeds from issuance
of common stock of $295,245 partially and (ii) offset by $40,000 of principle payments on a note payable as compared to cash provided
by financing of $1,175,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019 consisting of (i) proceeds from a subscription receivable of $1,225,000
and offset by (ii) principle payment of $50,000 on a note payable. The cash flow generated from our operations to date has not
been sufficient to fund our working capital needs, and we cannot predict when operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund working
capital needs.
 
There were no acquisitions of property and equipment
during the Nine-Months FY2020 or the Nine-Months FY2019.
 
Accrued expenses as of November 30, 2019 decreased
$1.1 million to $1,066,260 from $2,197,129 as of February 28, 2019 due to the one-time cancellation of accounts payable, customer
deposits and unpaid salaries and related expenses discussed above. Accrued expense-related party decreased by $1.0 million to $0
associated with the cancellation of the related party obligation as discussed above.
 
The Company had a deficit of $19.3 million in shareholders’
equity as of November 30, 2019, compared to $21.6 million as of February 28, 2019 with the net change attributed to net income
of approximately $1.6 million and the issuance of shares of $0.7 million.
 
In the past, in order to generate liquidity we have
relied upon external sources of financing, principally equity financing and private indebtedness. We have no bank line of credit
and require additional debt or equity financing to fund ongoing operations.
 
The issuance of additional shares of equity in connection
with any such financing could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, and such dilution could be substantial. If we
cannot raise needed funds, we would also be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could
adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk
 
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide disclosure under this Item 3.
 
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. For the last 3 fiscal years, these control and procedures
broke down due to insufficient capital to maintain such controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to its management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s management evaluated,
with the participation of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that these controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this
report in ensuring that information requiring disclosure is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. The Company continues to remediate the findings contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K/A, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, issued on October 24, 2019.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There have been no other changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2019, not previously identified in our Annual Report on Form
10-K/A, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 and issued on October 24, 2019 which have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
 
ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
 
We are subject to the legal proceedings and claims
discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually and in the
aggregate and evaluates potential losses on such litigation if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable. However,
the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Although management
considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company
for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting
period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters subsequent to year end that did not individually
or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. 
 
In 2017, the Company’s former COO was awarded
approximately $238,000 in accrued salary and related charges by the California labor board. The Company believes that this award
does not reflect the amount owed which is significantly lower and is exploring all its options and available remedies and is working
toward an offer to settle this matter. 
 
In 2016, the Company and the Company’s former
Chief Executive Officer, Melvin Gagerman, were named among several other defendants in a lawsuit filed by two secured creditors
demanding repayment of loans totaling $125,000 plus accrued interest and exemplary damages. In January 2017, the Company entered
into an agreement with all secured creditors other than the two plaintiffs. In September 2018 the court entered a judgment of approximately
$235,000 in favor of the two secured creditors. The Company subsequently appealed this judgment and, in September 2019, reached
a settlement agreement with these creditors.

The Company is presently engaged in a dispute with
one of its former directors, Robert Kopple, relating to approximately $10 million and approximately 3.15 million warrants which
Mr. Kopple claims to be owed to him and his affiliates by the Company. In July 2017, Mr. Kopple filed suit against the Company
as well as against current director Mr. Diaz-Verson and former directors Mr. Breslow and Mr. Howsmon, as well as Mr. Gagerman,
the former CEO (not a director) in connection with these allegations. In 2018, the Court sustained demurrers by Mr. Diaz-Verson,
Mr. Breslow, Mr. Howsmon and Mr. Gagerman and as a result of these successful demurrers, all four of these defendants have been
dismissed from the suit. While the Company believes that it has certain valid defenses in these matters, the Company is currently
in settlement discussions with Mr. Kopple. If the settlement negotiation is unsuccessful, the Company intends to vigorously defend
against these claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional
information regarding the transactions under dispute with Mr. Kopple.
 
In April 2018, the Company filed suit against its former
counsel, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP alleging various acts of malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty committed by
the firm in connection with its representation of Aura. In June 2018, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP filed a cross-complaint
against the Company claiming in excess of $400,000 in allegedly unpaid legal fees. In January 2019, the Company reached a settlement
with Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, pursuant to which, among other things, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP agreed
to dismiss its cross-complaint and waive all unpaid legal fees. The action and the cross-complaint were both subsequently dismissed.
 
In February 2018, the Company failed to issue shares
of stock contractually owed toBetterSea, LLC. On August 15, 2018, 7,364,735 restricted shares were issued in fulfillment of this
contractual obligation based on the then-outstanding closing quote of the stock. The issuance of the shares was previously reported
by the Company. The Company also paid $20,000 in legal fees related to legal expense associated with the Company’s delays
in the issuance of the stock.
 
In May 2018, Shelley Scholnick dba JB Transporters
brought suit against the Company claiming ongoing fees in excess of $52,000 owed for the storage of the Company’s property.
Notably, in June 2017, the Company had brought suit against J.B. Moving & Delivery, a business operated and controlled by Scholnick’s
relative, Jacob Binstok, for damages suffered by the Company as a result of the defendant’s improper storage of the Company’s
property and improper refusal to return such property. In 2018, the Company successfully received a judgment against J.B. Moving
& Delivery in the amount of approximately $114,000. The Company disputes that any amount is now owed to Scholnick.
 
On March 26, 2019, various stockholders of the Company
controlling a combined total of more than 27.5 million shares delivered a signed written consent to the Company removing Ronald
Buschur as a member of the Company’s Board and electing Cipora Lavut as a director of the Company.  On March 27, 2019,
those same stockholders delivered a further signed written consent to the Company removing William Anderson and Si Ryong Yu as
members of the Company’s Board and electing Robert Lempert and David Mann as directors of the Company. These written consents
represented a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of March 26, 2019 and March 27,
2019, respectively. Because of Aura’s refusal to recognize the legal effectiveness of the consents, on April 8, 2019
the stockholders filed suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General
Corporations Law, seeking an order confirming the validity of the consents and declaring that Aura’s Board consists of Ms. Lavut,
Mr. Mann, Mr. Lempert, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Diaz-Versón, Jr. On July 8, 2019 the Court of Chancery
entered final judgment in favor of the stockholder plaintiffs, confirming that (a) Ronald Buschur, Si Ryong Yu and William Anderson
had been validly removed by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock acting by written consent (b) Ms.
Lavut, Mr. Mann and Mr. Lempert had been validly elected by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock
acting by written consent, and (c) the Company’s Board of Directors validly consists of Cipora Lavut, David Mann, Robert
Lempert, Gary Douglas and Salvador Diaz-Versón, Jr.

ITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
 
As of the date of this filing, Robert Kopple,
the Company’s Vice Chairman of the Board, is the only significant unsecured note holder that has not agreed to restructure
his debt. Mr. Kopple claims to be owed approximately $5.3 million plus interest and approximately 3.14 million warrants on terms
significantly preferable to other similarly-situated unsecured creditors. To-date, Mr. Kopple has not accepted the Company’s
multiple offers to restructure his debt. The Company is presently engaged in a dispute with Mr. Kopple relating to the debt and
securities which Mr. Kopple claims to be owed to him and his affiliates by the Company. See, “Note 3 – Notes Payable”
and “Note 5 – Related Parties Transactions” to the Company’s condensed financial statements and “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” in “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding amounts that may be owed
under the Company’s notes payable and the recent restructuring of certain Company debt.
 
In June 2014, we entered into a Financing Letter
of Agreement (the “June 2014 Agreement”) with two affiliate entities of Mr. Kopple, KF Business Ventures and the Kopple
Family Partnership (the “Additional Kopple Parties”), pursuant to which the Additional Kopple Parties loaned us an
additional $1,000,000 (the “June 2014 Loan”). In connection with the June 2014 Loan, Mr. Kopple also added $202,205
in penalties and accrued interest, credited us with $200,000 for amounts previously repaid by us and consolidated several earlier
advances into a single new note (the “June 2014 Kopple Note”) in the principal amount of $2,715,2067 and bearing simple
interest at a rate of 10% per annum. We were also required to obtain a subordination agreement from the Breslow Parties in favor
of the Kopple Parties with respect to the June 2014 Kopple Note.
  
Pursuant to the June 2014 Agreement, the Kopple
Parties also placed various restrictions on our ability to raise additional capital, hire qualified personnel and pay certain expenses
without his prior approval for so long as the principal amount of his note remained outstanding. The June 2014 Kopple Note also
required us to issue Mr. Kopple a stock purchase warrant (the “June 2014 Kopple Warrant”) to purchase approximately
771,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share, to be exercisable for seven years. Additionally, if
we borrowed funds, issued capital stock or rights to acquire or convert into capital stock, or granted rights in respect to territories
to any person for cash consideration of more than $5 million in the aggregate after the date of the June 2014 Kopple Note, we would
be required to pay the entire amount of such cash consideration in excess of $5 million as a mandatory prepayment of the June 2014
Kopple Note. Additionally, Mr. Kopple required a default provision providing that in the event that the entire outstanding balance
of the June 2014 Kopple Note was not paid in full prior to October 1, 2014, then for each consecutive calendar month during the
period beginning October 1, 2014 and ending March 31, 2015, we would issue to Mr. Kopple additional stock purchase warrants, each
to purchase 416,458 shares of our common stock, up to a maximum aggregate of approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock,
at $0.70 per share (the “Kopple Penalty Warrants”), the Kopple Penalty Warranties to be exercisable for seven years
from the time of their respective issuances. In addition to the Kopple Penalty Warrants, the default provision under the June 2014
Kopple Note provides for a 5% late charge on the total amount due plus 15% per year interest. We have not repaid the Kopple Parties
for the amounts loaned to us. Additionally, we have not issued any of the Kopple Penalty Warrants and management believes that
Mr. Kopple is not entitled to receive them. We have also cancelled the June 2014 Kopple Warrant.
 
We consider the transactions described above with Mr. Kopple to
be related party transactions.
