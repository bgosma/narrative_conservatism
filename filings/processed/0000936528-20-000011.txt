AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED)NOTE A – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesCompany and Nature of Operations - Washington Federal Bank, National Association, a federally-insured national bank dba WaFd Bank (the “Bank” or “WaFd Bank”), was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate.  Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington corporation (the “Company”), was formed as the Bank’s holding company in November, 1994. As used throughout this document, the terms “Washington Federal” or the “Company” refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term “Bank” refers to the operating subsidiary, Washington Federal Bank, National Association. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The Bank conducts its activities through a network of 234 bank branches located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Basis of Presentation - The Company has prepared the consolidated unaudited interim financial statements included in this report. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in the interim financial statements. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“2019 Annual Financial Statements”). Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements are disclosed in its 2019 Annual Financial Statements. There have not been any material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies compared to those contained in its 2019 Annual Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2019.Restricted Cash Balances - Based on the level of vault cash on hand, the Company was not required to maintain cash reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, the Company pledged cash collateral related to derivative contracts of $20,400,000 and $31,850,000, respectively.Equity Securities - The Company records equity securities within Other assets in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values (marketable) are measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized as a component of Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments in equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values (non-marketable) are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer, also referred to as the measurement alternative. Any adjustments to the carrying value of these investments are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.NOTE B – New Accounting PronouncementsIn April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses (ASU 2016-13), hedging (ASU 2017-12), and recognition and measurement of financial instruments (ASU 2016-01). The amendments generally have the same effective dates as their related standards. If already adopted, the amendments of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and the amendments of ASU 2017-12 are effective as of the beginning of the Company’s next annual reporting period; early adoption is permitted. The Company previously adopted both ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01 and does not expect the amendments of ASU 2019-04 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-13 and will consider the amendments of ASU 2019-04 as part of that process.9Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. The amendments in this ASU align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The amendments also require the entity to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement, including reasonably certain renewal periods. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU adds, eliminates, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Among the changes, entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted. Entities are also allowed to elect early adoption of the eliminated or modified disclosure requirements and delay adoption of the added disclosure requirements until their effective date. The Company early adopted this ASU beginning October 1, 2019 and removed or modified disclosures as permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements. The ASU provides entities with relief from the costs of implementing certain aspects of the new leasing standard, ASU No. 2016-02. Specifically, under the amendments in ASU 2018-11: (1) entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the new leasing standard, and (2) lessors may elect to not separate non-lease components from leases when certain conditions are met. The amendments have the same effective date as ASU 2016-02 (October 1, 2019 for the Company). The Company adopted this ASU beginning October 1, 2019 and elected both transition options. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The ASU, as amended, is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investments in leases and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments require that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The ASU eliminates the current framework of recognizing probable incurred losses and instead requires an entity to use its current estimate of all expected credit losses over the contractual life. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets.For purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (“PCD assets”) that are measured at amortized cost, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the asset. Subsequent changes in estimated cash flows would be recorded as an adjustment to the allowance and through the statement of income.Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security's cost basis. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For most debt securities, the transition approach requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the first reporting period the guidance is effective. For other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities and PCD assets, the guidance will be applied prospectively. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its consolidated financial statements and the reserve for credit losses may increase upon adoption given that the allowance will be required to cover the full remaining expected life of the portfolio upon adoption, rather than the incurred loss model under current U.S. GAAP. The extent of this increase is still being evaluated and will depend on economic conditions and the composition of the Company’s loan, lease and held-to-maturity securities portfolios at the time of adoption.  10Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The ASU, as amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions and introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements. Accounting by lessors is largely unchanged. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU beginning October 1, 2019 utilizing the transition method allowed under ASU 2018-11 and did not restate comparative periods. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us to carry forward our historical lease classifications and our assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease. We also elected to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet. The adoption of this ASU resulted in an increase in other assets and an increase in other liabilities of $29,013,000 and $29,013,000, respectively. The Company recognized no cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings upon adoption.NOTE C – Dividends and Share RepurchasesOn November 22, 2019, the Company paid a regular dividend on common stock of $0.21 per share, which represented the 147th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Dividends per share were $0.21 and $0.18 for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On January 22, 2020, the Company declared a regular dividend on common stock of $0.22 per share, which represents its 148th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. This dividend will be paid on February 21, 2020 to common shareholders of record on February 7, 2020.  For the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 914,161 shares at an average price of $36.62. As of December 31, 2019, there are 7,052,600 remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the current Board approved share repurchase program. NOTE D – Loans ReceivableThe following table is a summary of loans receivable.11Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) The following table sets forth information regarding non-accrual loans. The Company recognized interest income on non-accrual loans of approximately $497,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2019. Had these loans been on accrual status and performed according to their original contract terms, the Company would have recognized interest income of approximately $353,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019. Recognized interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was higher than what otherwise would have been recognized in the period due to the collection of past due amounts. Interest cash flows collected on non-accrual loans vary from period to period as those loans are brought current or are paid off. The following tables provide details regarding delinquent loans. 12Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) There are no loans greater than 90 days delinquent and still accruing interest as of either date. Most loans restructured in TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modification due to temporary financial difficulties. As of December 31, 2019, 96.0% of the Company's $110,835,000 in TDRs were classified as performing. Each request for modification is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession granted in a loan modification is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of between 100 to 200 basis points for a specific term, usually six to twenty four months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans. As of December 31, 2019, single-family residential loans comprised 92.2% of TDRs.The Company reserves for restructured loans within its allowance for loan loss methodology by taking into account the following performance indicators: 1) time since modification, 2) current payment status and 3) geographic area.13Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) NOTE E – Allowance for Losses on LoansThe following tables summarize the activity in the allowance for loan losses. The Company recorded a $1,000,000 release of loan loss allowance for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to a $500,000 release for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Reserving for new loan originations has been largely offset by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Recoveries, net of charge-offs, totaled $2,579,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to net recoveries of $1,408,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2018.  Non-performing assets were $39,742,000, or 0.24% of total assets, at December 31, 2019, compared to $43,826,000, or 0.27% of total assets, at September 30, 2019. Non-accrual loans were $30,089,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $33,731,000 at September 30, 2019. Delinquencies, as a percent of total loans, were 0.30% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.29% at September 30, 2019.14Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) The following tables show loans collectively and individually evaluated for impairment and the related allocation of general and specific reserves. As of December 31, 2019, $132,253,000 of the allowance was calculated under the Company's general allowance methodology and the remaining $260,000 was specific reserves on loans deemed to be individually impaired. As of September 30, 2019, $131,095,000 of the allowance was calculated under the Company's general allowance methodology and the remaining $439,000 was specific reserves on loans deemed to be individually impaired.The Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes its loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a 15Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans. Based on that risk rating, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows:•Pass – the credit does not meet one of the definitions below.•Special mention – A special mention credit is considered to be currently protected from loss but is potentially weak. No loss of principal or interest is foreseen; however, proper supervision and management attention is required to deter further deterioration in the credit. Assets in this category constitute some undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a risk rating of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset.•Substandard – A substandard credit is an unacceptable credit. Additionally, repayment in the normal course is in jeopardy due to the existence of one or more well defined weaknesses. In these situations, loss of principal is likely if the weakness is not corrected. A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified will have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of the debt. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets risk rated substandard.•Doubtful – A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans.•Loss – Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should be taken in the period in which they are identified as uncollectible. Partial charge-off versus full charge-off may be taken if the collateral offers some identifiable protection.16Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) NOTE F – Fair Value MeasurementsFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active exchange markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.The Company has established and documented the process for determining the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value is determined using valuation models or third-party appraisals. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure and report the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.Measured on a Recurring BasisAvailable-for-Sale Securities and Derivative ContractsSecurities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of debt securities are priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and under GAAP are considered a Level 2 input method. Securities that are traded on active exchanges are measured using the closing price in an active market and are considered a Level 1 input method.The Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk. At the same time, the Company enters into the opposite trade with a counter party to offset its interest rate risk. The Company has also entered into commercial loan hedges, mortgage pool hedges and borrowings hedges using interest rate swaps. The fair value of these interest rate swaps are estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique. These are considered a Level 2 input method. 21Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) The following tables present the balance of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  22Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) Measured on a Nonrecurring BasisCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after initial recognition such as loans measured for impairment and real estate owned ("REO"). REO consists principally of properties acquired through foreclosure. From time to time, and on a nonrecurring basis, adjustments using fair value measurements are recorded to reflect increases or decreases based on the discounted cash flows, the current appraisal or estimated value of the collateral or REO property.When management determines that the fair value of the collateral or the real estate owned requires additional adjustments, either as a result of an updated appraised value or when there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the impaired loan or real estate owned as Level 3. Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019 included loans for which a specific reserve allowance was established or a partial charge-off was recorded based on the fair value of collateral, as well as real estate owned where the fair value of the property was less than the cost basis.The following tables present the aggregated balance of assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and the total gains (losses) resulting from those fair value adjustments during the respective periods. The estimated fair value measurements are shown gross of estimated selling costs. (1)The gains (losses) represent remeasurements of collateral-dependent loans.(2)The gains (losses) represent remeasurements of REO.(1)The gains (losses) represent remeasurements of collateral-dependent loans.(2)The gains (losses) represent remeasurements of REO.Fair Values of Financial InstrumentsFASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825") requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the statement of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate those values. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value estimates presented do not reflect the underlying fair value of the Company. Although management is not aware of any factors that would materially affect the estimated fair value amounts presented below, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since the dates shown, and therefore, estimates of fair value subsequent to those dates may differ significantly from the amounts presented below. 23Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:Cash and cash equivalents – The carrying amount of these items is a reasonable estimate of their fair value. Available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities – Securities at fair value are primarily priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and are considered a Level 2 input method. Equity securities that are exchange traded are considered a Level 1 input method.Loans receivable – Fair values are estimated first by stratifying the portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as multi-family real estate, residential mortgage, construction, commercial, consumer and land loans. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed- and adjustable-rate interest terms. For residential mortgages and multi-family loans, the bank determined that its best exit price was by securitization. MBS benchmark prices are used as a base price, with further loan level pricing adjustments made based on individual loan characteristics such as FICO score, LTV, Property Type and occupancy. For all other loan categories an estimate of fair value is then calculated based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate offered and observed in the market on similar products, plus an adjustment for liquidity to reflect the non-homogeneous nature of the loans, as well as, a annual loss rate based on historical losses to arrive at an estimated exit price fair value. Fair value for impaired loans is also based on recent appraisals or estimated cash flows discounted using rates 24Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) commensurate with risk associated with the estimated cash flows. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information.FHLB and FRB stock – The fair value is based upon the par value of the stock that equates to its carrying value.Time deposits – The fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.FHLB advances – The fair value of FHLB advances and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities.Interest rate swaps – The Company offers interest rate swaps to its variable rate borrowers who want to manage their interest rate risk. At the same time, the Company enters into the opposite trade with a counterparty to offset its interest rate risk. The Company also uses interest rate swaps for various fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. The fair value of these interest rate swaps is estimated by a third party pricing service using a discounted cash flow technique.  The following tables provide details about the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.  25Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) For available-for-sale investment securities, there were purchases of $82,028,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and purchases of $172,076,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2018. There were no sales of available-for-sale investment securities during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and sales of $491,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2018. For held-to-maturity investment securities, there were no purchases during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and no purchases during the three months ended December 31, 2018. There were no sales of held-to-maturity investment securities during either period. Substantially all of the agency mortgage-backed securities have contractual due dates that exceed 10 years.The following tables show the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, by length of time that individual securities in each category have been in a continuous loss position. The decline in fair value since purchase is attributable to changes in interest rates. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and does not consider it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be upon maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 26Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) NOTE G – Derivatives and Hedging ActivitiesThe following tables present the fair value, notional amount and balance sheet classification of derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019.The Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. These arrangements include hedges of individual fixed rate commercial loans and also hedges of a specified portion of pools of prepayable fixed rate mortgage loans under the "last of layer" method. These relationships qualify as fair value hedges under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"), which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the respective interest rate swap and the hedged items. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item. Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. The hedge basis adjustment remains with the hedged item until the hedged item is de-recognized from the balance sheet. The following tables present the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the hedged items at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019.27Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

The primary purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk of changes in future cash flows resulting from increasing interest rates. For qualifying cash flow hedges under ASC 815, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, the maturities for hedges of adjustable rate borrowings ranged from less than one to seven years, with the weighted average being 2.4 years.        28Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) The Company periodically enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rate payments, while the Company retains a variable rate loan. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the client’s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under ASC 815, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. There was no net impact to the statement of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 as the changes in fair value of the receive fixed swap and pay fixed swap offset each other.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) NOTE H – Revenue from Contracts with CustomersSince net interest income on financial assets and liabilities is outside the scope of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), a significant majority of our revenues are not subject to that guidance.Revenue streams that are within the scope of ASC 606 are presented within non-interest income and are, in general, recognized as revenue at the same time the Company's obligation to the customer is satisfied. Most of the Company's customer contracts that are within the scope of the new guidance are cancelable by either party without penalty and are short-term in nature. These sources of revenue include depositor and other consumer and business banking fees, commission income, as well as debit and credit card interchange fees. In scope revenue streams represented approximately 4.4% of our total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2018. As this standard is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, the Company has omitted certain disclosures in ASC 606, including the disaggregation of revenue table. Sources of non-interest income within the scope of the guidance include the following:Deposit related and other service charges (recognized in Deposit fee income) - The Company's deposit accounts are governed by standardized contracts customary in the industry. Revenues are earned at a point in time or over time (monthly) from account maintenance fees and charges for specific transactions such as wire transfers, stop payment orders, overdrafts, debit card replacements, check orders and cashier’s checks. The Company’s performance obligation related to each of these fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, at the time the service is provided (point in time or monthly). The Company is principal in each of these contracts.Debit and Credit Card Interchange Fees (recognized in Deposit fee income) - The Company receives interchange fees from the debit card or credit card payment network based on transactions involving debit or credit cards issued by the Company, generally measured as a percentage of the underlying transaction. Interchange fees from debit and credit card transactions are recognized as the transaction processing services are provided by the network. The Company acts as an agent in the card payment network arrangement so the interchange fees are recorded net of any expenses paid to the principal (the card payment network in this case).Insurance Agency Commissions (recognized in Other income) - WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Washington Federal Bank, N.A. that operates as an insurance agency, selling and marketing property and casualty insurance policies for a small number of high-quality insurance carriers. WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. earns revenue in the form of commissions paid by the insurance carriers for policies that have been sold. In addition to the origination commission, WAFD Insurance Group, Inc. may also receive contingent incentive fees based on the volume of business generated for the insurance carrier and based on policy renewal rates. NOTE I – Commitments and ContingenciesLease Commitments - The Company’s lease commitments consist primarily of real estate property for branches and office space under various non-cancellable operating leases that expire between 2020 and 2070. The majority of the leases contain renewal options and provisions for increases in rental rates based on a predetermined schedule or an agreed upon index. If, at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are recognized on the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Company's collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities. The related right-of-use asset is included in Other assets. 31Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of the above operating lease liability was $1,488,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019. Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities during the same period were $2,083,000.The following table presents the components of net lease costs, a component of Occupancy expense. The Company elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead account for them as a single lease component. Variable lease costs include subsequent increases in index-based rents and variable payments such as common area maintenance.The following table shows future minimum payments for operating leases as of December 31, 2019 for the respective periods. 32Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(UNAUDITED) Future minimum lease payments for the Company’s operating leases as of September 30, 2019, prior to the adoption of the new lease guidance, were as follows.Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk - The only material off-balance-sheet credit exposures are loans in process and unused lines of credit, which had a combined balance of $2,639,733,000 and $2,379,089,000 at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The Company reserves for estimated losses on these off-balance-sheet credit exposures using historical loss factors for each type of credit. The reserve was $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2019, which is an increase from $6,900,000 at September 30, 2019Legal Proceedings - The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time defendants in and are threatened with various legal proceedings arising from regular business activities. Management, after consulting with legal counsel, is of the opinion that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from these pending or threatened actions and proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.33Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC.

Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington corporation (the “Company”), was formed as the Bank’s holding company 34Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESin November, 1994. As used throughout this document, the terms “Washington Federal” or the “Company” refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term “Bank” refers to the operating subsidiary, Washington Federal Bank, National Association. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.  The Company's fiscal year end is September 30th. All references to 2019 represent balances as of September 30, 2019 or activity for the fiscal year then ended.INTEREST RATE RISKBased on management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing shorter-term loans and transaction deposit accounts, to reduce its interest rate risk profile. The mix of transaction and savings accounts is 61% of total deposits as of December 31, 2019 while the composition of the investment securities portfolio is 25% variable and 75% fixed rate. When interest rates rise, the fair value of the investment securities with fixed rates will decrease and vice versa when interest rates decline. The Company has $1,360,694,000 of mortgage-backed securities that it has designated as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gain on these securities was $19,726,000. The Company has $1,495,586,000 of available-for-sale securities that are carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gain on these securities was $25,523,000. The Company has executed interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk on certain FHLB borrowings. The unrealized loss on these interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2019 was $4,762,000. All of the above are pre-tax net unrealized gains or losses. The Company relies on various measures of interest rate risk, including an asset/liability analysis, modeling of changes in forecasted net interest income under various rate change scenarios, and the impact of interest rate changes on the net portfolio value (“NPV”) of the Company.Net Interest Income Sensitivity - The Company estimates the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in the Company's interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates. The analysis assumes a constant balance sheet. Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the size and composition of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates.As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in both short and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by 0.7% in the next year. This compares to an estimated increase of 1.4% as of the September 30, 2019 analysis. The change is primarily due to fluctuating interest rates and the impact to expected prepayment speeds as well as shifts in the mix of fixed versus adjustable rate assets and updated deposit betas used for transaction deposits in the Company's asset liability management model. Management estimates that a gradual increase of 300 basis points in short term rates and 100 basis points in long term rates over two years would result in a net interest income decrease of 0.1% in the first year and decrease of 3.6% in the second year assuming a constant balance sheet and no management intervention. NPV Sensitivity - NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity. NPV is calculated as the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-paying liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of NPV to changes in interest rates provides a view of interest rate risk as it incorporates all future expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decline by $369,764,000 or 14.5% and the NPV to total assets ratio to decline to 13.9% from a base of 15.2%. As of September 30, 2019, the NPV in the event of a 200 basis point increase in rates was estimated to decline by $257,638,000 or 10.5% and the NPV to total assets ratio to decline to 13.9% from a base of 14.6%. The change in NPV sensitivity is due primarily to fluctuating interest rates that have impacted asset prices as well as sensitivity to expected prepayment speeds on fixed rate loans and mortgage-backed securities as of December 31, 2019.Interest Rate Spread - The interest rate spread is measured as the difference between the rate on total loans and investments and the rate on costing liabilities at the end of each period. The interest rate spread decreased to 2.76% at December 31, 2019 from 2.80% at September 30, 2019. The spread compression of 4 basis points is primarily due to the decrease in short-term interest rates, which resulted in a lower rate on interest earning assets partially offset by a lower rate on interest-bearing liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average rate earned on interest-earning assets decreased by 10 basis points to 4.00% compared to September 30, 2019, while the weighted average rate being paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 6 basis 35Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESpoints to 1.24%. The interest rate spread decreased to 2.76% at December 31, 2019 from 2.86% at December 31, 2018 due to the same factors described above.Net Interest Margin - Net interest margin is measured as net interest income divided by average earning assets for the period. Net interest margin decreased to 3.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 from 3.21% for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 5 basis points to 4.30% and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 3 basis points to 1.27% over that same period. The lower yield on interest-earning assets is the result of the decrease in short-term interest rates, which resulted in a lower rate being earned on cash and adjustable rate loans and investment securities. The higher rate in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the increase in rates on interest-bearing deposits partially offset by lower rates paid on FHLB advances.  The following tables set forth the information explaining the changes in the net interest margin for the period indicated compared to the same period one year ago.As of December 31, 2019, total assets had decreased by $51,749,000 to $16,423,161,000 from $16,474,910,000 at September 30, 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents increased by $64,647,000, loans receivable decreased $25,714,000, and investment securities decreased by $72,942,000.  Cash and cash equivalents of $483,805,000 and shareholders’ equity of $2,050,909,000 as of December 31, 2019 provide management with flexibility in managing interest rate risk going forward.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments (including prepayments), net deposit inflows, repayments and sales of investments and borrowings and retained earnings, if applicable. The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Additionally, the Company earns fee income for loan, deposit, insurance and other services. The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") up to 45% of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. This line provides a substantial source of additional liquidity if needed. 36Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESThe Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term loan agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank's primary credit program. The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $483,805,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase from $419,158,000 at September 30, 2019. These amounts include the Bank's operating cash.   The Company’s shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 was $2,050,909,000, or 12.49% of total assets. This is an increase of $17,914,000 from September 30, 2019 when net worth was $2,032,995,000, or 12.34% of total assets. The Company’s shareholders' equity was impacted in the three months ended December 31, 2019 by net income of $65,703,000, the payment of $16,433,000 in cash dividends, treasury stock purchases of $33,479,000, as well as other comprehensive income of $694,000. The ratio of tangible capital to tangible assets at December 31, 2019 was 10.80%. Management believes the Company's strong net worth position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment.Washington Federal, Inc. and its banking subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements.  Federal banking agencies establish regulatory capital rules that require minimum capital ratios and establish criteria for calculating regulatory capital. Minimum capital ratios for four measures are used for assessing capital adequacy. The standards are indicated in the table below.  The common equity tier 1 capital ratio recognizes common equity as the highest form of capital.  The denominator for all except the leverage ratio is risk weighted assets. The rules set forth a “capital conservation buffer” of up to 2.5%. In the event that a bank’s capital levels fall below the minimum ratios plus these buffers, the bank's regulators may place restrictions on it. These restrictions include reducing dividend payments, share buy-backs, and staff bonus payments. The purpose of these buffers is to require banks to build up capital outside of periods of stress that can be drawn down during periods of stress. As a result, even during periods where losses are incurred, the minimum capital ratios can still be met. 37Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESThere are also standards for Adequate and Well Capitalized criteria that are used for “Prompt Corrective Action” purposes. To remain categorized as well capitalized, the Bank and the Company must maintain minimum common equity risk-based, tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based and tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table.  CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITIONCash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents are $483,805,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $64,647,000, or 15.4%, since September 30, 2019. Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities - Available-for-sale securities increased $9,844,000, or 0.7%, during the three months ended December 31, 2019, mostly due to purchases of $82,028,000, partially offset by principal repayments and maturities of $69,085,000 and a decrease to net unrealized gain of $2,149,000. During the same period, the balance of held-to-maturity securities decreased by $82,786,000 primarily due to principal pay-downs and maturities of $81,329,000. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of $25,523,000, which is included on a net of tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).    38Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESLoans receivable - Loans receivable, net of related contra accounts, decreased by $25,714,000 to $11,904,861,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to $11,930,575,000 at September 30, 2019. The decrease resulted primarily from loan principal repayments of $1,301,419,000 and an increase in loans in process of $110,941,000, partially offset by originations of $1,371,315,000. Commercial loan originations accounted for 76% of total originations and consumer loan originations were 24% during the period. The mix of loan originations is consistent with management's strategy during low rate environments to produce more construction, multifamily, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans that generally have adjustable interest rates or a shorter duration. The following table shows the loan portfolio by category and the change. Non-performing assets - Non-performing assets decreased $4,084,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2019 to $39,742,000 from $43,826,000 at September 30, 2019. The change is due to a $3,642,000 decrease in non-accrual loans and $442,000 decline in real estate owned ("REO"). Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.24% at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.27% at September 30, 2019.   39Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESThe following table sets forth information regarding restructured loans and non-performing assets.For the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $497,000 in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans. The Company would have recognized interest income of $353,000 for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. Recognized interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was higher than what otherwise would have been recognized in the period due to the collection of past due amounts. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had $64,511,000 of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at December 31, 2019 but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total NPAs and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 1.28% at December 31, 2019.Restructured single-family residential loans are reserved for under the Company’s general reserve methodology. If any individual loan is significant in balance, the Company may establish a specific reserve as warranted. Most restructured loans are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. Single-family residential loans comprised 92.2% of restructured loans as of December 31, 2019. The concession for these loans 40Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESis typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twenty-four months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period.For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are generally required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances after the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment will conclude that collection of the entire principal balance is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual. Homogeneous loans may or may not be on accrual status at the time of restructuring, but all are placed on accrual status upon the restructuring of the loan. Homogeneous loans are restructured only if the borrower can demonstrate the ability to meet the restructured payment terms; otherwise, collection is pursued and the loan remains on non-accrual status until liquidated. If the homogeneous restructured loan does not perform, it will be placed in non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent.A loan that defaults and is subsequently modified would impact the Company’s delinquency trend, which is part of the qualitative risk factors component of the general reserve calculation. Any modified loan that re-defaults and is charged-off would impact the historical loss factors component of the Company's general reserve calculation.Allowance for loan losses - The following tables show the Company’s allowance for loan losses by loan category.41Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESReserve for losses on unfunded commitments - Unfunded commitments tend to vary depending on the Company's loan mix and the proportionate share of commercial loans. The balance of unfunded commitments was $2,639,733,000 and $2,379,089,000 at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The Company reserves for estimated losses on these off-balance-sheet credit exposures using historical loss factors for each type of credit. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2019, which is an increase from $6,900,000 at September 30, 2019. Management believes the allowance for loan losses plus the reserve for unfunded commitments, totaling $140,013,000, or 1.04% of gross loans, is sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the portfolio of loans and unfunded commitments. See Note E and Note I for further details of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments as of and for the period ended December 31, 2019.Real estate owned - REO decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2019 by $442,000 to $6,339,000, primarily due to sales of REO properties during the period. Intangible assets - Intangible assets increased to $310,477,000 as of December 31, 2019 from $309,247,000 as of September 30, 2019. The increase was due to the purchase of a small insurance agency, partially offset by amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.    Customer accounts - Customer accounts decreased $58,626,000, or 0.5%, to $11,932,138,000 at December 31, 2019 compared with $11,990,764,000 at September 30, 2019. The following table shows the composition of the Bank’s customer accounts by deposit type.FHLB advances and other borrowings - Total borrowings totaled $2,250,000,000 as of December 31, 2019, unchanged from $2,250,000,000 as of September 30, 2019. The weighted average rate for FHLB borrowings was 2.46% as of December 31, 2019 and 2.49% at September 30, 2019. The decrease was due to lower rates on new FHLB advances.Shareholders' equity - The Company’s total shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 was $2,050,909,000, or 12.49% of total assets. This was an increase of $17,914,000 from the September 30, 2019 total of $2,032,995,000, or 12.34% of total assets. The Company’s equity was impacted in the three months ended December 31, 2019 by net income of $65,703,000, the payment of $16,433,000 in cash dividends, treasury stock purchases of $33,479,000, as well as other comprehensive income of $694,000.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet Income - The Company recorded net income of $65,703,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $52,942,000 for the prior year quarter. Net Interest Income - For the three months ended December 31, 2019, net interest income was $119,685,000, which is $533,000 higher than the same quarter of the prior year. Net interest margin was 3.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.21% for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the average balance of earning assets increasing by $357,032,000, partially offset by a $258,059,000 increase in average balance on interest-bearing liabilities. The compression in net interest margin to 3.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 from 42Table of ContentsWASHINGTON FEDERAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES3.21% for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was due to the yield on earning assets decreasing by 5 basis points to 4.30% and the cost of interest bearing liabilities increasing 3 basis points to 1.27% over that same period. The lower yield on earning assets is the result of the decrease in short-term interest rates, which resulted in a lower rate being earned on cash and adjustable rate loans and investment securities. The higher rate in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the increase in rates on interest-bearing deposits partially offset by lower rates paid on FHLB advancesThe following table sets forth certain information explaining changes in interest income and interest expense for the period indicated compared to the same period one year ago. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.Rate / Volume Analysis:___________________ (1)Includes interest on cash equivalents and dividends on FHLB & FRB stock.Provision (Release) for Loan Losses - The Company recorded a $1,000,000 release of loan loss allowance for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with a $500,000 release for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Reserving for new loan originations has been largely offset by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Recoveries, net of charge-offs, totaled $2,579,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to net recoveries of $1,408,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2018.   Other Income - The three months ended December 31, 2019 results include total other income of $46,376,000 compared to $19,009,000 for the same period one year ago, a $27,367,000 increase. The increase is primarily due to the three months ended December 31, 2019 including a gain of $32,600,000 on sales of fixed assets, while the three months ended December 31, 2018 included a net gain of $6,400,000 recognized on the sale and valuation adjustments of fixed assets.  Other Expense - Other expenses have increased as a result of ongoing investments in people, process and technology with the objective of growing market share and ultimately earnings. The three months ended December 31, 2019 results include total other expense of $82,636,000 compared to $71,672,000 for the same period one year ago, a $10,964,000 increase. The increase is primarily due to information technology being higher by $8,067,000 which was largely from a $5,931,000 impairment charge on systems hardware and software. In addition, compensation and benefits costs increased by $2,748,000 primarily due to an increase in headcount. The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, increased by 4.8% to 2,001 at December 31, 2019 from 1,910 at December 31, 2018. Total other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 equaled 2.02% and 1.79%, respectively, of average assets.
