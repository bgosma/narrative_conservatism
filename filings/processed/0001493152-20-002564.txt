1 – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
 
Organization
 
Investview,
Inc. was incorporated on January 30, 1946, under the laws of the state of Utah as the Uintah Mountain Copper Mining Company. In
January 2005 the Company changed domicile to Nevada, and changed its name to Voxpath Holding, Inc. In September of 2006 the Company
merged The Retirement Solution Inc. through a Share Purchase Agreement into Voxpath Holdings, Inc. and then changed its name to
TheRetirementSolution.Com, Inc. In October 2008 the Company changed its name to Global Investor Services, Inc., before changing
its name to Investview, Inc., on March 27, 2012.
 
On
March 31, 2017, we entered into a Contribution Agreement with the members of Wealth Generators, LLC, a limited liability company
(“Wealth Generators”), pursuant to which the Wealth Generators members agreed to contribute 100% of the outstanding
securities of Wealth Generators in exchange for an aggregate of 1,358,670,942 shares of our common stock. The closing of the Contribution
Agreement was effective April 1, 2017, and Wealth Generators became our wholly owned subsidiary and the former members of Wealth
Generators became our stockholders and control the majority of our outstanding common stock.
 
On
June 6, 2017, we entered into an Acquisition Agreement with Market Trend Strategies, LLC, a company whose members are also former
members of our management. Under the Acquisition Agreement, we spun-off our operations that existed prior to the merger with Wealth
Generators and sold the intangible assets used in those pre-merger operations in exchange for Market Trend Strategies’ assumption
of $419,139 in pre-merger liabilities.
 
On
February 28, 2018, we filed a name change for Wealth Generators, LLC to Kuvera, LLC (“Kuvera”) and on May 7, 2018
we established WealthGen Global, LLC as a Utah limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Investview, Inc.
 
On
July 20, 2018, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with United Games Marketing LLC, a Utah limited liability company, to purchase
its wholly owned subsidiaries United Games, LLC and United League, LLC for 50,000,000 shares of our common stock.
 
On
November 12, 2018, we established Kuvera France, S.A.S. to handle sales of our financial education and research in the European
Union.
 
On
December 30, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary S.A.F.E. Management, LLC received its registration and disclosure approval from
the National Futures Association. S.A.F.E. Management, LLC is now a New Jersey State Registered Investment Adviser, Commodities
Trading Advisor, Commodity Pool Operator, and approved for over the counter FOREX advisory services.
 
On
January 17, 2019 we renamed our non-operating wholly owned subsidiary WealthGen Global, LLC to SafeTek, LLC, a Utah Limited Liability
Company.
 
Effective
July 22, 2019 we renamed our non-operating wholly owned subsidiary Razor Data, LLC to APEX Tek, LLC, a Utah Limited Liability
Company.
 
Nature
of Business
 
Investview
owns a number of companies that each operate independently but are accretive to one another. Investview is establishing a portfolio
of wholly owned subsidiaries delivering leading edge technologies, services and research, dedicated primarily to the individual
consumer. Following is a description of each of our companies.
 
Kuvera,
LLC provides research, education, and investment tools designed to assist the self-directed investor in successfully navigating
the financial markets. These services include research, trade alerts, and live trading rooms that include instruction in equities,
options, FOREX, ETFs, binary options, crowdfunding and cryptocurrency sector education. In addition to trading tools and research,
we also offer full education and software applications to assist the individual in debt reduction, increased savings, budgeting,
and proper tax management. Each product subscription includes a core set of trading tools/research along with the personal finance
management suite to provide an individual with complete access to the information necessary to cultivate and manage his or her
financial situation. Different packages are available through a monthly subscription that can be cancelled at any time at the
discretion of the customer. A unique component of the product marketing plan is the distribution method whereby all subscriptions
are sold via current participating customers who choose to distribute and sell the services by participating in the bonus plan.
The bonus plan participation is purely optional but enables individuals to create an additional income stream to further support
their personal financial goals and objectives.

NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis
of Presentation
 
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations
(Regulation S-X) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2020. These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the March 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019.
 
Principles
of Consolidation
 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Investview, Inc., and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Kuvera, LLC, Investment
Tools & Training, LLC, Apex Tek, LLC (formerly Razor Data, LLC), S.A.F.E. Management, LLC, SafeTek, LLC (formerly WealthGen
Global, LLC), United Games, LLC, United League, LLC, and Kuvera France S.A.S. Through March 31, 2019 we had determined that one
affiliated entity, Kuvera LATAM S.A.S., which we previously conducted business with, was a variable interest entity and we were
the primary beneficiary of the entity’s activities, which are similar to those of Kuvera, LLC. As a result, through March
31, 2019 we had consolidated the accounts of this variable interest entity into the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Further, because the Company did not have any ownership interest in this variable interest entity, the Company had allocated the
contributed capital in the variable interest entity as a component of noncontrolling interest. As of April 1, 2019 Kuvera LATAM
S.A.S. had no operations and ceased to exist, therefore, as of that date, no consolidation of the entity is necessary and we recorded
a gain on deconsolidation of $53,739 to eliminate the intercompany account with Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Financial
Statement Reclassification
 
Certain
account balances from prior periods have been reclassified in these consolidated financial statements to conform to current period
classifications.

Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Foreign
Exchange
 
We
have consolidated the accounts of Kuvera France S.A.S. into our consolidated financial statements and have consolidated the accounts
of Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. through March 31, 2019. The operations of Kuvera France S.A.S. are conducted in France and its functional
currency is the Euro. The operations of Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. were conducted in Colombia and its functional currency is the Colombian
Peso.
 
The
financial statements of Kuvera France S.A.S. and Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. are prepared using their respective functional currency and
have been translated into U.S. dollars (“USD”). Assets and liabilities are translated into USD at the applicable exchange
rates at period-end. Stockholders’ equity is translated using historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated
at the average exchange rates for the period. Any translation adjustments are included as foreign currency translation adjustments
in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders’ equity (deficit).
 
The
following rates were used to translate the accounts of Kuvera France S.A.S. and Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. into USD at the following
balance sheet dates.
 

 
The
following rates were used to translate the accounts of Kuvera France S.A.S. and Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. into USD for the following
operating periods.
 

 
Cryptocurrencies
 
We
hold cryptocurrency-denominated assets (“cryptocurrencies”) and include them in our consolidated balance sheet as
other current assets. We record cryptocurrencies at fair market value and recognize the change in the fair value of our cryptocurrencies
as an unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 the fair
value of our cryptocurrencies was $156,448 and $142,061, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we recorded
$(657) and $8,445 as a total realized and unrealized gain (loss) on cryptocurrency, respectively. During the nine months ended
December 31, 2018 we recorded $16,363 and $95,810 as a total realized and unrealized gain (loss) on cryptocurrency, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2019 we recorded $10 and $(16,885) as a total realized and unrealized gain (loss) on
cryptocurrency, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 we recorded $10 and $(16,885) as a total realized
and unrealized gain (loss) on cryptocurrency, respectively.
 
Fixed
Assets
 
Fixed
assets are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. When retired or otherwise
disposed, the carrying value and accumulated depreciation of the fixed asset is removed from its respective accounts and the net
difference less any amount realized from disposition is reflected in earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs which
do not extend the useful lives of the related assets are expensed as incurred.

(Unaudited)
 
As
of December 31, 2019 fixed assets were made up of the following:
 

 
Total
depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $320,528 and $4,126, respectively.
 
Long-Lived
Assets – Intangible Assets & License Agreement
 
We
account for our intangible assets and long-term license agreement in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-30, General Intangibles
Other Than Goodwill, and ASC Subtopic 360-10-05, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC Subtopic
350-30 requires assets to be measured based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets (or net
assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measurable. Further, ASC Subtopic 350-30 requires
an intangible asset to be amortized over its useful life and for the useful life to be evaluated every reporting period to determine
whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of useful life is
changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
Costs of internally developing, maintaining, or restoring intangible assets are recognized as an expense when incurred.
 
In
June of 2017 we issued 80,000,000 shares of common stock with a value of $2,256,000 for a 15-year license agreement. Annual amortization
over the 15-year life is expected to be $150,400 per year. Amortization recognized for the nine months ended December 31, 2019
and 2018 was $113,315 and $113,315, respectively, and the long-term license agreement was recorded at a net value of $1,869,905
and $1,983,220 as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
 
In
June of 2018 we purchased United Games, LLC and United League, LLC and recorded the transaction as a business combination. Intangible
assets acquired in the business combination were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are being amortized on
a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we impaired the value
of the customer contracts/relationships originally acquired.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019
(Unaudited)
 
Amortization
expense is expected to be as follows:
 

 
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
 
We
have adopted ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360-10”). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or when the historical cost carrying value
of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business
conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period.
 
The
Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon future net cash flows expected to result from the asset,
including eventual disposition. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted
and an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value or disposable
value. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 impairment of $627,452 and $0 was recognized, respectively.
 
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date, based on our principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous
market for the specific asset or liability.
 
U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles provide for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value, defined as follows:
 



 
Level
    1:
 
Inputs
    that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access.

 
 
 
 

 
Level
    2:
 
Inputs
    other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
    for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including:

 


 
-
quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

 
-
quoted
    prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;

 
-
inputs
    other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and

 
-
inputs
    that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

 


 
Level
    3:
 
Inputs
    that are unobservable and reflect management’s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing
    the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions
    surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows).

 

Our
financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. We have determined that the book value
of our outstanding financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, approximates the fair value due to their
short-term nature.
 
Items
recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the
following items as of December 31, 2019:

Items
recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the
following items as of March 31, 2019:
 

 
Sale
and Leaseback
 
Through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, APEX Tex, LLC, we sell high powered data processing equipment (“APEX”) to our customers
and they lease the equipment back to SAFETek, LLC, another of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We account for these transactions
under ASC 842-40 where the leaseback has been deemed a sales-type lease due to the lease term generally covering the entire economic
life of the equipment and our likelihood to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term. In accordance with ASC 842-40 we
have recorded the data processing equipment as a fixed asset on our balance sheet and we have accounted for the amounts received
for the equipment as a financial liability, in other liabilities on our balance sheet. Further, we will recognize interest on
the financial liability over the term of the lease to ensure the financial liability equates to the total amounts to be paid over
the life of the lease.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we had the following activity related to our sale and leaseback transactions:
 

 
[1]
Represents lease payments to be made in the next 12 months
 
As
of December 31, 2019 we have received proceeds of $607,205 in additional deposits for APEX sales, which has been recorded in the
customer advance amount shown on our balance sheet.
 
Revenue
Recognition
 
Subscription
Revenue
 
The
majority of our revenue is generated by subscription sales and payment is received at the time of purchase. We recognize subscription
revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer
and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract. Our performance obligation is to provide
services over a fixed subscription period, therefore we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period and deferred revenue
is recorded for the portion of the subscription period subsequent to each reporting date. Additionally, we offer a 10-day trial
period to subscription customers, during which a full refund can be requested if a customer does not like the product. Revenues
are deferred during the trial period as collection is not probable until that time has passed. Revenues are presented net of refunds,
sales incentives, credits, and known and estimated credit card chargebacks.

Equipment
Sales
 
We
generate revenue from the sale of high-speed computer processing equipment that is used for any of the following intense processing
activities: protein folding, CGI rendering, Game Streaming, Machine & Deep Learning, Mining, Independent Financial Verification,
and general high-speed computing. We recognize equipment sales revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured
based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified
in each contract. Our performance obligation is to deliver an equipment package to our customers which includes hardware, software,
and firmware and is drop-shipped to a hosting data center. We receive payment at the time of purchase and recognize revenue when
the equipment package is delivered and ready for maintenance and hosting, which our customers arrange for, and obtain, from a
separate third party that provides such services.
 
Cryptocurrency
Mining Service Revenue
 
We
generate revenue from the sale of cryptocurrency mining services to our customers through an arrangement with a third-party supplier.
We recognize cryptocurrency mining service revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration
specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.
Our performance obligation is to arrange for the third-party to provide mining services to our customers and payment is received
at the time of purchase, therefore revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment. We recognize revenue in the amount of the fee
to which we are entitled to as an agent, or the amount of consideration that we retain after paying the third-party the consideration
received in exchange for the services the third-party is to provide.
 
Mining
Revenue
 
Through
our wholly owned subsidiary, SAFETek, LLC, we lease equipment under a sales-type lease and use the equipment on blockchain networks
to validate and add blocks of transactions to blockchain ledgers (commonly referred to as “mining”). As compensation
for mining we are issued fees from processors and/or block rewards that are newly created cryptocurrency units granted to us.
Our mining activities constitute our ongoing major and central operations of SAFETek, LLC. Because we do not have contracts, nor
do we have customers associated with our mining revenue, we recognize revenue when fees and/or rewards are settled, or ultimately
granted to us as a result of our mining activities.
 
Fee
Revenue
 
We
generate fee revenue from our customers through SAFE Management, our subsidiary licensed as a Registered
Investment Advisor and Commodities Trading Advisor. We recognize fee revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue
is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation
specified in each contract. Our performance obligation is to deliver fully managed trading services
to individuals who do not meet the requirements of Qualified Investors and who lack the time to trade for themselves. We recognize
fee revenue as our performance obligation is met and we receive payment for such advisory fees in the month following recognition.
 
Revenue
generated for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 is as follows:

Net
Income (Loss) per Share
 
We
follow ASC subtopic 260-10, Earnings per Share (“ASC 260-10”), which specifies the computation, presentation, and
disclosure requirements of earnings per share information. Basic loss per share has been calculated based upon the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Convertible debt, stock options, and warrants have been excluded as common stock equivalents
in the diluted loss per share because their effect is anti-dilutive on the computation.
 
Potentially
dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:
  

 
Lease
Obligation
 
We
determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in the operating lease right-of-use asset account,
the operating lease liability, current account, and the operating lease liability, long term account in our balance sheet. Right-of-use
assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make
lease payments arising from the lease. 
 
Operating
lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over
the lease term. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have elected
to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases (leases with terms of twelve months or less). Lease
terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease
expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have elected the practical
expedient and will not separate non-lease components from lease components and will instead account for each separate lease component
and non-lease component associated with the lease components as a single lease component.

losses, which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $33,684,432 as of December 31, 2019, along with a net loss of $8,587,449
for the nine months ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, we had cash of $263,600 and a working capital
deficit of $10,938,623. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Historically
we have relied on increasing revenues and new debt and equity financing to pay for operational expenses and debt as it came due.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we raised $2,177,452 in cash proceeds from new debt arrangements, raised $2,164,500
in cash proceeds from related parties, and received $825,000 from the sale of our common stock. Additionally, net cash provided
by operations was $4,690,473 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019.
 
Since
our acquisition of Wealth Generators in April of 2017 we have implemented a number of initiatives and we are beginning to see
the positive impact of these actions. First, our largest subsidiary, Kuvera, has a bonus plan structure for distributors of our
services which consistently paid out beyond our maximum threshold. Adjustments to this bonus plan have been made over the last
12 months. This resulted in a gradual reduction in bonus payouts which reduced our losses. Second, we expanded the objectives
of Investview through the acquisition and creation of additional subsidiaries to increase our sources of income and creating business
activities in new sectors which includes:
 


 
●
Fully
    licensing SAFE Management LLC as a Registered Investment Advisor and Commodities Trading Advisor.
    This was done so SAFE Management could offer fully managed trading services to individuals who lacked the time to trade for
    themselves and provide reasonable advisory fees and minimum investment amounts to service individuals who do not meet the
    requirements of Qualified Investors.

 
 
 

 
●
We
    acquired the assets of United Games LLC and United League LLC which provided us highly experienced
    management, programmers, marketing and compliance personnel along with key technology components such as a fully coded back
    office and trademarked FIREFAN app. We are still in the process of adapting their technology to Kuvera operations and working
    on various distribution plans for FIREFAN.

 
 
 

 
●
We
    changed the name of our subsidiary WealthGen Global, which was an unused entity, to SAFETek LLC
    in preparation for our entry into the high-performance computing space to meet the needs of 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution)
    business needs which includes mining, blockchain technologies, gaming, artificial intelligence and 3-Dimensional rendering.
    This will enable us to provide HPC services to small, medium and startup entities who require specialized high-speed processing
    but cannot afford the infrastructure. By leasing our processing to these companies, we will aid these entities in bringing
    their products, inventions, improvements to market.

 
 
 

 
●
We
    have designed a program known as APEX which enables individuals to purchase highly customized
    data processing equipment which SAFETek will lease from the purchasers for a fixed period of time at a fixed monthly lease
    payment. This enables individuals to participate in emerging growth without experiencing the volatility and potential loss
    experienced in the sector.

 
 
 

 
●
We
    have renamed our subsidiary Razor Data LLC to APEX Tek LLC. APEX Tek will be solely responsible for the sales and marketing
    of the APEX Package.

 
These
companies provide Investview a stake in 4IR, HPC, app development, fintech, blockchain and personal money management sectors.
Each of these are areas that are targeted for significant growth spurred by innovations through technology.
 
While
our liabilities are larger than our assets it is important to note that we seek to keep operating expenses low. The assets we
have acquired and will continue to seek out are those of technology, mobile apps, and human resources. These assets are not easily
defined on our balance sheet but represent our ability to carry out our objectives which we believe will ultimately generating
positive cash flow, reduced debt and then profitability.

Further,
while we have reported reoccurring losses and have an operating capital deficiency, we have been able to establish multiple companies
to create various revenue streams as we move forward. Our largest challenge is operational cash flow as lending arrangements continue
to be expensive causing us to deploy incoming cash to prior debt. We continue to seek short term capital in arrangements that
are partnership-based with elements of debt and equity combined. Additionally, our immediate focus is the continued reduction
in losses by controlling expenses, increasing revenue, and generating additional revenue streams.
 
Accordingly,
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not
necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Our
debt consisted of the following:
 

 
 




 

 
During
January 2019, we entered into a Secured Merchant Agreement for future receivables with an entity that provides quick access to
working capital. On January 11, 2019, we received proceeds from this arrangement of $349,851. In accordance with the terms of
the agreement, we were required to repay $489,650 by making daily ACH payments of $1,000 for the first 30 days following the date
of the agreement and daily ACH payments of $2,999 thereafter. Accordingly, we recorded $139,799 as a debt discount at the inception
of the agreement, which was the difference between the funds received and the amount that was to be repaid. In February 2019 we
replaced this agreement with a new Secured Merchant Agreement (see below), therefore transferring $449,657 of amounts owed to
a new agreement. However, prior to the terminating the January agreement, we made payments of $39,993 and amortized $139,799 into
interest expense.
 
During
February 2019, we entered into a Secured Merchant Agreement for future receivables with an entity that provides quick access to
working capital. On February 15, 2019, we received proceeds from this arrangement of $73,801 after paying off $233,501 from a
September 2018 agreement (see above) and $449,657 from a January 2019 agreement (see above). In accordance with the terms of the
agreement, we were required to repay $909,350 by making daily ACH payments of $5,049. Accordingly, we recorded $152,391 as a debt
discount at the inception of the agreement, which was the difference between the funds received plus the earlier debt paid off,
and the amount that was to be repaid. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we repaid $141,372 and amortized $26,100 into interest
expense.
 
Effective
August 16, 2019 this debt was refinanced and the outstanding balance of $316,093 was rolled into a new debt arrangement, see notation
[10] below. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, prior to the refinance, we repaid $451,886 and amortized $126,292
into interest expense.

for future receivables. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, prior to the refinance, we repaid $559,486 and amortized
$446,605 into interest expense related to the August 2019 arrangement. As a result of the refinancing arrangement we received

In
addition to the above debt transactions that were outstanding as of September 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, during the nine months
ended December 31, 2019, we also received proceeds of $200,000 from two additional short-term notes ($100,000 each) and received
proceeds of $140,000 from a convertible promissory note. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded interest
expense of $30,000 for fixed interest and extension fees on the short-term notes and made total cash payments of $230,000 to extinguish
the interest and principal amounts due on the short-term notes. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we accounted for
the conversion feature in the convertible note as a derivative instrument, therefore at inception recorded a debt discount of
$143,000 and captured loan fees, recorded as interest expense, of $718,518. By the time we repaid the convertible note in December
of 2019 we had amortized the full $143,000 into interest expense, recorded additional interest expense on the note of $45,094
(inclusive of a prepayment penalty), and paid off the note, accrued interest, and prepayment penalties for $188,094.

we had the following activity in our derivative liability account:
 

 
We
use the binomial option pricing model to estimate fair value for those instruments convertible into common stock, at inception,
at conversion date, and at each reporting date. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the assumptions used in our binomial
option pricing model were in the following range:
 

 
NOTE
8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)
 
Preferred
Stock
 
We
are authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 and our Board of Directors has the
authority to issue one or more classes of preferred stock with rights senior to those of common stock and to determine the rights,
privileges and preferences of that preferred stock.
 
As
of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 we had no preferred stock issued or outstanding.
 
Common
Stock
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we issued 59,215,648 shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of $825,000.
 
In
conjunction with the sale of common stock during the year ended March 31, 2018, we provided a guarantee to certain individuals
such that we would issue additional shares of our common stock if the average closing price of our common stock fell below $0.02
per share on the 20 days preceding the 18-month anniversary of the date the shares were originally sold. As a result of this guarantee,
we had recorded $626,388 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. During the year
ended March 31, 2019, the 18-month anniversary passed without the common stock falling below the set threshold, therefore, we
were released from the guarantee, and we increased additional paid-in capital by $525,000 to remove the previously recorded offering
costs. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the 18-month anniversary passed without the common stock falling below
the set threshold, therefore, we were released from the guarantee, and we increased additional paid-in capital by $101,387 to
remove the previously recorded offering costs.
 
Also
during the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we issued 241,000,000 shares of common stock, valued at $3,865,500 based on the
market value on the day of issuance, to multiple employees for services and compensation, which is subject to forfeiture if the
employee is not in good standing at the time the shares are fully vested. Of the $3,865,500 value we recognized $1,844,639 as
an expense during the nine months ending December 31, 2019 and the remaining $2,020,861 will be recognized ratably over the vesting
term. In addition to the shares issued to employees, we also issued an additional 285,618,592 shares of common stock, valued at
$831,800 based on the market value on the day of issuance, for services.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we repurchased 5,150 shares of common stock for $102 and we cancelled 22,500,000 shares
that were returned in accordance with the terms of a Convertible Promissory Note (see Note 6), reducing common stock by $22,500
and increasing additional paid in capital by the same. We also cancelled 200,000,000 shares returned in conjunction with the termination
of a Joint Venture Agreement entered into in March of 2019, reducing common stock by $200,000, reducing additional paid in capital
by $3,180,000, offset with a reduction in our prepaid asset of $3,380,000. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we recorded
a beneficial conversion feature of $1,000,000 related to a convertible promissory note entered into with a related party (see

of all legal proceedings we were involved in during the nine months ended December 31, 2019.
 

 
NOTE
10 – OPERATING LEASE
 
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”)
model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Leases are classified
as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations.
We adopted ASU No. 2016-02 on April 1, 2019. We did not record a lease asset and lease liability as of the adoption date as we
had no lease arrangements or lease obligation at that time.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we entered two operating leases for office space in Eatontown, New Jersey (the “Eatontown
Lease”) and Kaysville, Utah (the “Kaysville Lease”). We have the option to extend the three year lease term
of the Eatontown Lease for a period of one year. In addition, we are obligated to pay twelve monthly installments to cover an
annual utility charge of $1.75 per rentable square foot for electric usage within the demised premises. As the lessor has the
right to digitally meter and charge us accordingly, these payments were deemed variable and will be expensed as incurred. During
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 the variable lease costs amounted to $831 and $1,385, respectively. At commencement
of the Eatontown Lease, right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities amounted to $110,097. We
have the option to extend the twelve-and-a-half-month lease term of the Kaysville Lease for a period of one year. At commencement
of the Kaysville Lease, right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities amounted to $21,147.
 
Operating
lease expense was $16,397 and $24,630 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Operating cash flows
used for the operating leases during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 were $12,897 and $18,797, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term was 2.34 years and the weighted average discount rate was 12%.

Results
of Operations
 
Three
Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2018
 
Revenues
 
We
recorded net revenue of $4,963,611 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, which was a decrease of $2,769,423 or 36%, from
the prior period revenue of $7,733,034. This decrease was due to a minor loss of repeat subscription customers coupled with our
lack of cryptocurrency service revenue. The lack of cryptocurrency revenue can be explained by our termination of the agent arrangement
with a third-party supplier of crypotocurrency mining services.
 
Operating
Costs and Expenses
 
We
recorded operating costs and expenses of $6,702,907 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, which was a decrease of $1,272,015,
or 16%, from the prior period’s operating costs and expenses of $7,974,922. The decrease can be fully explained by the decrease
in commissions, which was a result of our bonus plans paying out beyond our maximum threshold in the prior period due to certain
bonus programs in place, which has since been adjusted to reduce such payouts. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 commissions
as a percent of total net revenue was 32%, versus 66% in the prior period.
 
Other
Income and Expenses
 
We
recorded other expense of $2,086,434 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, which was a difference of $1,878,614, or 904%,
from the prior period other expense of $207,820. The change is due to the interest expense incurred in the three months ended
December 31, 2019 of $1,794,623 versus only $206,007 incurred in the prior period.

Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Nine Months Ended December 31, 2018
 
Revenues
 
We
recorded net revenue of $19,717,448 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, which was a decrease of $3,625,155 or 16%, from
the prior period revenue of $23,342,603. This decrease was due to a minor loss of repeat subscription customers coupled with our
lack of cryptocurrency service revenue. The lack of cryptocurrency revenue can be explained by our termination of the agent arrangement
with a third-party supplier of crypotocurrency mining services.
 
Operating
Costs and Expenses
 
We
recorded operating costs and expenses of $24,355,004 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, which was a decrease of $1,872,691,
or 7%, from the prior period’s operating costs and expenses of $26,227,695. This change is principally a result of a decrease
of $6,494,247, or 38%, in commissions which was a result of our bonus plans paying out beyond our maximum threshold in the prior
period due to certain bonus programs in place, which has since been adjusted to reduce such payouts. The decrease was offset by
an increase in salary and related costs which was due to the Company recording $2,676,439 worth of stock for services and compensation.
 
Other
Income and Expenses
 
We recorded other expense of $3,940,313
for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, which was a difference of $5,859,552, or 305%, from the prior period other income
of $1,919,239. The change is due to the gain on bargain purchase recorded as a result of the United Games, LLC and United League,
LLC acquisition that took place during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to no such gain in the
prior period. Additionally, in the current period there was interest expense recorded of $5,536,354 offset by a gain on debt extinguishment
of $1,725,384, whereas in the prior period interest expense was only $215,154 and there was a gain on debt extinguishment of $19,387.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a net loss of $8,587,449. This loss was funded by cash provided by operating
activities of $4,690,473 offset by cash used in investing activities of $4,171,341 and cash used in financing activities of $389,212.
As a result, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $129,956 to $263,600 as compared to $133,644 at the beginning of the fiscal
year.
 
Our
current liabilities exceeded our current assets (working capital deficit) by $10,938,623 as of December 31, 2019, as compared
to $2,222,990 at March 31, 2019. The increase in the working capital deficit is due to an increase in our other current liabilities
of $7,576,800 which is due to cash received for our APEX program, which results in the Company recording financial liabilities
for amounts to be repaid under the program.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, we raised $2,177,452 in cash proceeds from new debt arrangements, raised $2,164,500 in
cash proceeds from related parties, and received $825,000 from the sale of our common stock. Additionally, net cash provided by
operations was $4,690,473 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 due mostly do the receipt of $9,693,141 of cash received
in from our APEX program.
 
Going
Concern
 
These
interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing
will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business.
Accordingly, the interim unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets
and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we not be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Our
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019, state that our historical losses, accumulated deficit,
cash balance, and working capital deficit raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. Historically
we have relied on increasing revenues and new debt and equity financing to pay for operational expenses and debt as it came due.
Going forward, we plan to reduce obligations with cash flow provided by operational growth as we have been, and plan to continue,
reducing bonus payouts, increasing sources of income and business activities in new sectors, and utilizing our acquired assets
to generate positive cash flow and reduce debt. Additionally, we plan to pursue additional debt and equity financing and to find
short term capital in arrangements that are partnership based with elements of debt and equity combined.

Critical
Accounting Policies
 
Basis
of Presentation
 
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations
(Regulation S-X) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2020. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the March 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019.
 
Principles
of Consolidation
 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Investview, Inc., and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Kuvera, LLC, Investment
Tools & Training, LLC, Apex Tek, LLC (formerly Razor Data, LLC), S.A.F.E. Management, LLC, SafeTek, LLC (formerly WealthGen
Global, LLC), United Games, LLC, United League, LLC, and Kuvera France S.A.S. Through March 31, 2019 we had determined that one
affiliated entity, Kuvera LATAM S.A.S., which we previously conducted business with, was a variable interest entity and we were
the primary beneficiary of the entity’s activities, which are similar to those of Kuvera, LLC. As a result, through March
31, 2019 we had consolidated the accounts of this variable interest entity into the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Further, because the Company did not have any ownership interest in this variable interest entity, the Company had allocated the
contributed capital in the variable interest entity as a component of noncontrolling interest. As of April 1, 2019 Kuvera LATAM
S.A.S. had no operations and ceased to exist, therefore, as of that date, no consolidation of the entity is necessary and we recorded
a gain on deconsolidation of $53,739 to eliminate the intercompany account with Kuvera LATAM S.A.S. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Sale
and Leaseback
 
Through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, APEX Tex, LLC, we sell high powered data processing equipment (“APEX”) to our customers
and they lease the equipment back to SAFETek, LLC, another of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We account for these transactions
under ASC 842-40 where the leaseback has been deemed a sales-type lease due to the lease term generally covering the entire economic
life of the equipment and our likelihood to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term. In accordance with ASC 842-40 we
have recorded the data processing equipment as a fixed asset on our balance sheet and we have accounted for the amounts received
for the equipment as a financial liability, in other liabilities on our balance sheet. Further, we will recognize interest on
the financial liability over the term of the lease to ensure the financial liability equates to the total amounts to be paid over
the life of the lease.
 
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 we had the following activity related to our sale and leaseback transactions:

Represents lease payments to be made in the next 12 months
 
As
of December 31, 2019 we have received proceeds of $607,205 in additional deposits for APEX sales, which has been recorded in the
customer advance amount shown on our balance sheet.

Revenue
Recognition
 
Subscription
Revenue
 
The
majority of our revenue is generated by subscription sales and payment is received at the time of purchase. We recognize subscription
revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer
and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract. Our performance obligation is to provide
services over a fixed subscription period, therefore we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period and deferred revenue
is recorded for the portion of the subscription period subsequent to each reporting date. Additionally, we offer a 10-day trial
period to subscription customers, during which a full refund can be requested if a customer does not like the product. Revenues
are deferred during the trial period as collection is not probable until that time has passed. Revenues are presented net of refunds,
sales incentives, credits, and known and estimated credit card chargebacks.
 
Equipment
Sales
 
We
generate revenue from the sale of high-speed computer processing equipment that is used for any of the following intense processing
activities: protein folding, CGI rendering, Game Streaming, Machine & Deep Learning, Mining, Independent Financial Verification,
and general high-speed computing. We recognize equipment sales revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured
based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified
in each contract. Our performance obligation is to deliver an equipment package to our customers which includes hardware, software,
and firmware and is drop-shipped to a hosting data center. We receive payment at the time of purchase and recognize revenue when
the equipment package is delivered and ready for maintenance and hosting, which our customers arrange for, and obtain, from a
separate third party that provides such services.
 
Cryptocurrency
Mining Service Revenue
 
We
generate revenue from the sale of cryptocurrency mining services to our customers through an arrangement with a third-party supplier.
We recognize cryptocurrency mining service revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration
specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.
Our performance obligation is to arrange for the third-party to provide mining services to our customers and payment is received
at the time of purchase, therefore revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment. We recognize revenue in the amount of the fee
to which we are entitled to as an agent, or the amount of consideration that we retain after paying the third-party the consideration
received in exchange for the services the third-party is to provide.
 
Mining
Revenue
 
Through
our wholly owned subsidiary, SAFETek, LLC, we lease equipment under a sales-type lease and use the equipment on blockchain networks
to validate and add blocks of transactions to blockchain ledgers (commonly referred to as “mining”). As compensation
for mining we are issued fees from processors and/or block rewards that are newly created cryptocurrency units granted to us.
Our mining activities constitute our ongoing major and central operations of SAFETek, LLC. Because we do not have contracts, nor
do we have customers associated with our mining revenue, we recognize revenue when fees and/or rewards are settled, or ultimately
granted to us as a result of our mining activities.
 
Fee
Revenue
 
We
generate fee revenue from our customers through SAFE Management, our subsidiary licensed as a Registered
Investment Advisor and Commodities Trading Advisor. We recognize fee revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue
is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation
specified in each contract. Our performance obligation is to deliver fully managed trading services
to individuals who do not meet the requirements of Qualified Investors and who lack the time to trade for themselves. We recognize
fee revenue as our performance obligation is met and we receive payment for such advisory fees in the month following recognition.

ITEM
3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required
to provide the information under this item.
 
ITEM
4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls
and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
 

 28 
 

 
Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure
control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial
Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective.
 
Changes
in Internal Controls
 
There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
