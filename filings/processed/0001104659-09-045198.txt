Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements:
 
1. Basis
of Presentation:  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto are
unaudited.  In the opinion of the
management of the International Business Machines Corporation (the company),
these statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring
nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the companys results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.
 
The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results
may be different. See the companys 2008 Annual Report for a discussion of the
companys critical accounting estimates.
 
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should
be read in conjunction with the companys 2008 Annual Report.
 
The company evaluated subsequent events through July 28,
2009, the date the companys Board of Directors reviewed the financial
statements to be issued. The company issued the financial statements on the
same day.
 
Within the financial tables in this Form 10-Q,
certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for
disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying
whole-dollar amounts.
 
2. Accounting Changes:  In
June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 168, The FASB
Accounting Standards Codification TM and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (the
Codification). The Codification, which was launched on July 1, 2009,
became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP,
superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(AICPA), Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) and related literature. The
Codification eliminates the GAAP hierarchy contained in SFAS No. 162 and
establishes one level of authoritative GAAP. All other literature is considered
non-authoritative. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued
for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The
company will adopt this Statement for its quarter ending September 30,
2009. There will be no change to the companys Consolidated Financial
Statements due to the implementation of this Statement.
 
In June 2009,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),
and SFAS No. 166,  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assetsan
amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS No. 167 amends FASB
Interpretation 46(R) to eliminate the quantitative approach previously
required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. SFAS No. 166 amends
SFAS No. 140 by removing the exemption from consolidation for Qualifying
Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs). This Statement also limits the circumstances
in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be
derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original
financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in
the financial statements being presented and/or when the transferor has
continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. The company will
adopt these Statements for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1,
2010. The company does not expect the adoption of these standards to have any
material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In May 2009,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events.  This Statement sets forth: 1) the period
after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity
should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition
or disclosure in the financial statements; 2) the circumstances under which an
entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance
sheet date in its financial statements; and 3) the disclosures that an entity
should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet
date. This Statement is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15,
2009. The company adopted this Statement in the quarter ended June 30,
2009. This Statement did not impact the consolidated financial results.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial Accounting Standard (FAS)
157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the
Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions
That Are Not Orderly. Based on the guidance, if an entity determines that the
level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and
that a transaction is not orderly, further analysis of transactions or quoted
prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transaction or quoted
prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157,
Fair Value Measurements. This FSP is to be applied prospectively and is
effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 with
early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The

Table of
Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
company adopted this FSP
in the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and there was no material impact on
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. The guidance applies to investments in debt
securities for which other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded. If an
entitys management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell a debt
security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the
security before recovery of its cost basis, then an entity may separate
other-than-temporary impairments into two components: 1) the amount related to
credit losses (recorded in earnings), and 2) all other amounts (recorded in
other comprehensive income). This FSP is to be applied prospectively and is
effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 with
early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The
company adopted this FSP for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and there
was no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28-1, Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The FSP amends SFAS No. 107,
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments to require an entity to
provide disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim
financial information. This FSP is to be applied prospectively and is effective
for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early
adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The company
adopted this FSP in the quarter ended June 30, 2009. There was no impact
on the Consolidated Financial Statements as it relates only to additional
disclosures. The required disclosures are included in Note 4, Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, on page 10.
 
In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which became
effective January 1, 2009 via prospective application to business
combinations. This Statement requires that the acquisition method of accounting
be applied to a broader set of business combinations, amends the definition of
a business combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an
acquirer to recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition
date and requires the assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination
to be measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date
(with limited exceptions). The company adopted this Statement on January 1,
2009. There was no impact upon adoption, and its effects on future periods will
depend on the nature and significance of business combinations subject to this
statement.
 
In April 2009,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies.
This FSP requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair
value can be reasonably estimated. If fair value cannot be reasonably
estimated, the asset or liability would generally be recognized in accordance
with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and FASB Interpretation No. 14,
Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss. Further, the FASB removed the
subsequent accounting guidance for assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies from SFAS No. 141(R). The requirements of this FSP carry
forward without significant revision the guidance on contingencies of SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, which was superseded by SFAS No. 141(R) (see
previous paragraph). The FSP also eliminates the requirement to disclose an
estimate of the range of possible outcomes of recognized contingencies at the
acquisition date. For unrecognized contingencies, the FASB requires that
entities include only the disclosures required by SFAS No. 5. This FSP was
adopted effective January 1, 2009. There was no material impact upon
adoption, and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and
significance of business combinations subject to this statement.
 
In April 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets. The FSP states that in developing assumptions about renewal or
extension options used to determine the useful life of an intangible asset, an
entity needs to consider its own historical experience adjusted for
entity-specific factors. In the absence of that experience, an entity shall
consider the assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or
extension options. This FSP is  applied
to intangible assets acquired after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this
FSP did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement
requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be
accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the
treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest
and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional
disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the
controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 160, the company adopted the Statement on January 1, 2009 via
retrospective application of the presentation and

disclosure requirements.
Noncontrolling interests of $119 million at December 31, 2008 were
reclassified from the Liabilities section to the Stockholders Equity section
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of January 1, 2009.
 
Noncontrolling
interest amounts of $0.4 million and $2 million, net of tax, for the three
months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively, and $3
million and $14 million, net of tax, for the six months ended June 30,
2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively, are not presented separately in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings due to immateriality, but are reflected
within the other (income) and expense line item.
 
In March 2008,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161
expands the current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, such that entities must now
provide enhanced disclosures on an interim and annual basis regarding how and
why the entity uses derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items are
accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and how derivatives and related hedged
items affect the entitys financial position, financial results and cash flow.
Pursuant to the transition provisions of the Statement, the company adopted
SFAS No. 161 on January 1, 2009. The required disclosures are
presented in Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging Transactions, on pages 12
to 18 on a prospective basis. This Statement does not impact the consolidated
financial results as it is disclosure-only in nature.
 
In February 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157.
FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 Fair Value
Measurements from 2008 to 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of
the provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities on January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact
on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3, Fair Value, on pages 10
and 11 for SFAS No. 157 disclosures.
 
In June 2008,
the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in
Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, which became
effective in 2009 via retrospective application. Under the FSP, unvested
share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included
in computing earnings per share (EPS) pursuant to the two-class method. The
two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock
and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and
their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Restricted
Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees prior to December 31, 2007 are
considered participating securities as they receive non-forfeitable dividend
equivalents at the same rate as common stock. RSUs granted after December 31,
2007 do not receive dividend equivalents and are not considered participating
securities. The company retrospectively adopted the FSP on January 1,
2009. The impact of adopting the FSP decreased previously reported diluted EPS
by $0.01 for the second-quarter 2008 and by $0.02 for the six months ended June 30,
2008. Previously reported basic EPS decreased by $0.01 for the second-quarter
2008 and by $0.02 for the six months ended June 30, 2008.
 
In November 2008,
the FASB ratified EITF Issue 08-7, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets.
A defensive intangible asset is an asset acquired in a business combination or
in an asset acquisition that an entity does not intend to actively use.
According to the guidance, defensive intangible assets are considered to be a
separate unit of account and valued based on their highest and best use from
the perspective of an external market participant. The company adopted EITF
08-7 on January 1, 2009. There was no material impact upon adoption, and
its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of the
business combinations subject to this statement.
 
In December 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement
Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP amends SFAS No. 132(R), Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits to require more detailed
disclosures about the fair value measurements of employers plan assets
including: (a) investment policies and strategies; (b) major
categories of plan assets; (c) information about valuation techniques and
inputs to those techniques, including the fair value hierarchy classifications
(as defined by SFAS No. 157) of the major categories of plan assets; (d) the
effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level
3) on changes in plan assets; and (e) significant concentrations of risk
within plan assets. The disclosures required by the FSP will be included in the
companys year ending 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements. This Statement
does not impact the consolidated financial results as it is disclosure-only in
nature.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Nonrecurring Basis
 
In the
fourth quarter of 2008, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment
of $81 million for an equity method investment. The resulting investment which
was classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy was valued using a discounted
cash flow model. The valuation inputs included an estimate of future cash
flows, expectations about possible variations in the amount and timing of cash
flows and a discount rate based on the risk-adjusted cost of capital. Potential
results were assigned probabilities that resulted in a weighted average or
most-likely discounted cash flow fair value as of December 31, 2008. The
fair value of the investment after impairment was $7 million at December 31,
2008. In the first half of 2009, the balance of this investment was further
reduced by an additional impairment of $5 million and other adjustments
primarily related to dividends. The balance of this investment was zero at June 30,
2009.
 
4. Fair
Value of Financial Instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, debt and marketable equity
securities and derivative financial instruments are recognized and measured at
fair value in the companys financial statements. Notes and other accounts
receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that
approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term
debt are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair
value. In the absence of quoted prices in active markets, considerable judgment
is required in developing estimates of fair value. Estimates are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current
market transaction. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate
fair values:
 
Loans and Long-term Receivables
 
Estimates
of fair value are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest
rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the
same remaining maturities.
 
Long-term Debt
 
For
publicly-traded debt, estimates of fair value are based on market prices. For
other debt, fair value is estimated based on rates currently available to the
company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The carrying
amount of long-term debt is $20,868 million and $22,689 million and the
estimated fair value is $22,999 million and $23,351 million at June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases is for leases that
relate principally to the companys equipment and are for terms ranging from
two to seven years. Net investment in sales-type and direct financing leases
includes unguaranteed residual values of $881 million and $916 million at June 30,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, and is reflected net of unearned
income of $987 million and $1,049 million and of allowance for doubtful
accounts of $201 million and $217 million at those dates, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
Commercial financing receivables relate primarily to inventory and accounts
receivable financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products.
Payment terms for inventory and accounts receivable financing generally range
from 30 to 90 days.
 
Client loan receivables relate to loans that are provided by Global
Financing primarily to the companys clients to finance the purchase of the
companys software and services. Separate contractual relationships on these
financing arrangements are for terms ranging from two to seven years. Each
financing contract is priced independently at competitive market rates. The
company has a history of enforcing the terms of these separate financing
agreements.
 
The company utilizes certain of its financing receivables as collateral for
non-recourse borrowings. Financing receivables pledged as collateral for
borrowings were $238 million and $373 million at June 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively.
 
The company did
not have any financing receivables held for sale as of June 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008.
 
6. Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions: The
company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender
and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the
company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and
client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established
risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and,
where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are
denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align
rate movements between the interest rates associated with the companys lease
and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing
debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign
currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow
volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the
company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will
fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit
risk, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully
selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other
factors. The companys established policies and procedures for mitigating
credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits
for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of
counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these
arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the
arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the
maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default. The company is also a party to collateral security
arrangements with certain counterparties. 
These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash
or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed
contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be fixed or can
vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings received from the
major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments
with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a liability position at
June 30, 2009 was $494 million for which the company has posted collateral
of $37 million. Full overnight collateralization of these agreements would be
required in the event that the companys credit rating falls below investment
grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative
instruments in net asset positions as of June 30, 2009 was $879 million.
This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date as a
result of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. This exposure is
reduced by $542 million of liabilities included in master netting arrangements
with those counterparties.  The company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master
netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon
payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related
derivative instruments.  At June 30,
2009, the company recorded $42 million in cash collateral related to all
applicable derivative instruments in prepaid expenses and other current assets
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
 
The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge
the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency
exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect
to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, expose the company to liquidity risk as the
derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not
offset by the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors
the cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these
hedging relationships by de-designating the derivative instrument to manage
this liquidity risk. Although not designated as
 
12





Table of
Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives
to offset the changes in fair value of the de-designated instruments from the
date of de-designation until maturity. The company expended $158 million and
$303 million related to maturities of derivative instruments that existed in
qualifying net investment hedge relationships in the three months and six
months ending June 30, 2009, respectively. At June 30, 2009, the
company had net assets of $105 million, representing the fair value of
derivative instruments in qualifying net investment hedge relationships. The
weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2009
was approximately 2 years. In addition, at June 30, 2009, the company had
net liabilities of $544 million representing the fair value of derivative
instruments that were previously designated in qualifying net investment
hedging relationships but were de-designated prior to June 30, 2009; of
this amount $251 million is expected to mature over the next twelve months. The
notional amount of these instruments at June 30, 2009 was $5,600 million
including original and offsetting transactions.
 
In its hedging programs,
the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps and
cross-currency swaps, depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is
not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
 
A brief description of
the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings
 
The company issues debt
in the global capital markets, principally to fund its financing lease and loan
portfolio. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate
mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce
overall interest cost, the company uses interest-rate swaps to convert specific
fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and
to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e.,
cash flow hedges). At June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of the
companys interest rate swaps was $8,361 million.
 
Forecasted Debt Issuance
 
The company is exposed to
interest rate volatility on forecasted debt issuances. To manage this risk, the
company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the
interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative
instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2009.
 
Foreign
Exchange Risk
 
Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net
Investment)
 
A significant portion of
the companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a
hedge of net investment to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of
major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also
uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk
management purpose. At June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1,000 million.
 
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
 
The companys operations
generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and
intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys
non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the parent company. In anticipation of these
foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency
markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to
manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years.
At June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of forward contracts
designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was
$21,261 million with a weighted-average remaining maturity of 1.4 years.

Table of
Contents
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  (continued)
 
Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
 
The
company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated
debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign
currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional
currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. At June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of cross-currency
swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was
$300 million.
 
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency
Asset/Liability Management
 
The company uses its
Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers
principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective
manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to
economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion
of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of
these forward and swap contracts are generally less than two years. The changes
in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures
are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2009, the total notional
amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency
exposure was $8,773 million.
 
Equity Risk Management
 
The company is exposed to
equity price changes related to certain obligations to employees. These equity
exposures are primarily related to market price movements in certain broad
equity market indices and in the companys own stock. Changes in the overall
value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes
equity derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge
the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives
are linked to the total return on certain broad equity market indices or the
total return on the companys common stock. They are recorded at fair value
with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of
derivative instruments in economic hedges of equity risk was $662 million.
 
Other Risks
 
The company holds
warrants to purchase approximately 0.25 million shares of common stock in
connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they
contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the
changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
 
The company is exposed to
a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms.
The company utilizes credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit

Notes to Consolidated Financial

At June 30, 2009, in connection with cash flow
hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net
losses of $402 million (before taxes), in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss). Of this amount, $182 million of losses are expected to be
reclassified to net income within the next twelve months, providing an
offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. At June 30,
2009, net losses of approximately $16 million
(before taxes), were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
in connection with cash flow hedges of the companys borrowings. Of this
amount, $6 million of losses are expected to be reclassified to net income
within the next twelve months, providing an offsetting economic impact against
the underlying transactions.
 
For the six months ending
June 30, 2009, there were no significant gains or losses recognized in
earnings representing hedge ineffectiveness or excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness (for fair value hedges), or associated with an underlying
exposure that did not or was not expected to occur (for cash flow hedges); nor
are there any anticipated in the normal course of business.
 
Refer to the 2008 IBM
Annual Report, Note A, Significant Accounting Policies on pages 73 and
74 for additional information on the companys use of derivative instruments.
 
7. Stock-Based Compensation: Stock-based
compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service period.  The following table presents total
stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings:

The
reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended June 30,
2009, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was
principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock option grants ($46
million), partially offset by an increase related to restricted and
performance-based stock units ($9 million). 
The reduction in pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the six
months ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the corresponding period in the
prior year, was principally the result of a reduction in the level of stock
option grants ($89 million), partially offset by an increase related to
restricted and performance-based stock units ($18 million).
 
As of June 30,
2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $1,315 million related to
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of approximately three years.
 
There were no significant capitalized stock-based
compensation costs at June 30, 2009 and 2008.
 
8. Segments:  The table on pages 70 and 71 of this Form 10-Q
reflects the results of the companys reportable segments consistent with the
management system used by the companys chief operating decision maker. These
results are not necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with GAAP. For
example, employee retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial
assumptions on a country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments based
on headcount.  Different results could
occur if actuarial assumptions that are unique to the segments were used.
Performance measurement is based on income before income taxes (pre-tax
income). These results are used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the
performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

In 2009, the company
expects to contribute to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans approximately
$1,100 million, which is the legally mandated minimum contribution for its
non-U.S. plans. Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first half of
2009 were $546 million.

The company received a $6.3 million subsidy in the
second quarter and $19.5 million for the first half of 2009 in connection with
the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. A
portion of this amount is used by the company to reduce its obligation and expense
related to the plan, and the remainder is contributed to the plan to reduce
contributions required by the participants. For further information related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug Act, see pages 115 and 116 in the companys
2008 Annual Report.
 
11. Acquisitions/Divestitures:
 
Acquisitions: During the six months ended June 30,
2009, the company completed two acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $40
million.
 
The Software
segment completed two acquisitions in the second quarter: Outblaze Limited and
Exeros, Inc., both privately held companies. Each acquisition further
complemented and enhanced the companys portfolio of product offerings. Purchase
price consideration was paid all in cash. These acquisitions are reported in
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows net of acquired cash and cash
equivalents.
 
The table below
reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting
purchase price allocations as of June 30, 2009:

The
acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions, and accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of the acquired entities were recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The primary items that
generated the goodwill are the value of the synergies between the acquired
companies and IBM and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualify as an amortizable intangible asset. The overall weighted-average life
of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is 5.0 years. With the
exception of goodwill, these identified intangible assets will be amortized on
a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill of $33 million has been
assigned to the Software segment. Substantially all of the goodwill is not
deductible for tax purposes.

Divestitures: On March 16, 2009, the company
completed the sale of certain processes, resources, assets and third-party
contracts related to its core logistics operations to Geodis. The company
received proceeds of $365 million and recognized a net gain of $298 million on
the transaction in the first quarter of 2009. The gain was net of the fair
value of certain contractual terms, certain transaction costs and related real
estate charges. As part of this transaction, the company outsourced its
logistics operations to Geodis which enables the company to leverage
industry-leading skills and scale and improve the productivity of the companys
supply chain.
 
In
2007, the company divested 51 percent of its printing business (InfoPrint) to
Ricoh. The company also stated that it would divest its remaining ownership to
Ricoh quarterly over a three year period from the closing date. At June 30,
2009, the companys ownership in InfoPrint was 16.2 percent. See the companys
2008 Annual Report on page 83 for additional information.

(a)               Other intangibles are
primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary business processes,
methodologies and systems, and impacts from currency translation.
 
The net carrying amount
of intangible assets decreased $299 million during the first half of 2009,
primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles. The aggregate intangible
amortization expense was $307 million and $618 million for the second quarter
and first six months of 2009, respectively, versus $337 million and $654
million for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2008,
respectively. In addition, in the first half of 2009, the company retired $478
million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying
amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
 
The amortization expense
for each of the five succeeding years relating to intangible assets currently
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is estimated to be
the following at June 30, 2009:

14.
Contingencies:  The company is involved in a variety of
claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise
from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including actions
with respect to contracts, intellectual property (IP), product liability,
employment, benefits, securities, foreign operations and environmental matters.
These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including
competitors, partners, clients, current or former employees, government and
regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which
the company does business.
 
The
following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the
company.
 
The
company is a defendant in an action filed on March 6, 2003 in state court
in Salt Lake City, Utah by The SCO Group (SCO v. IBM). The company removed the
case to Federal Court in Utah. Plaintiff is an alleged successor in interest to
some of AT&Ts Unix IP rights, and alleges copyright infringement, unfair
competition, interference with contract and breach of contract with regard to
the companys distribution of AIX and Dynix and contribution of code to Linux.
The company has asserted counterclaims, including breach of contract, violation
of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, intentional torts, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, breach of the General Public License that governs open source
distributions, promissory estoppel and copyright infringement. In October 2005,
the company withdrew its patent counterclaims in an effort to simplify

and focus the issues in
the case and to expedite their resolution. Motions for summary judgment were
heard in March 2007, and the court has not yet issued its decision. On August 10,
2007, the court in another suit, The SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc.,
issued a decision and order determining, among other things, that Novell is the
owner of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights, and obligating SCO to recognize Novells
waiver of SCOs claims against IBM and Sequent for breach of UNIX license
agreements. At the request of the court in SCO v. IBM, on August 31, 2007,
each of the parties filed a status report with the court concerning the effect
of the August 10th Novell ruling on the SCO v. IBM case, including the
pending motions. On September 14, 2007, plaintiff filed for bankruptcy
protection, and all proceedings in this case were stayed. In the SCO v. Novell
case, on November 25, 2008, SCO filed its notice of appeal to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which included an appeal of the August 10,
2007 ruling.
 
On November 29,
2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Platform Solutions, Inc. (PSI)
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
alleging that PSI violated certain intellectual property rights of IBM. PSI
asserted counterclaims against IBM. On January 11, 2008, the court
permitted T3 Technologies, a reseller of PSI computer systems, to intervene as
a counterclaim-plaintiff. T3 claims that IBM violated certain antitrust laws by
refusing to license its patents and trade secrets to PSI and by tying the sales
of its mainframe computers to its mainframe operating systems. On June 30,
2008, IBM acquired PSI. As a result of this transaction, IBM and PSI dismissed
all claims against each other, and PSI withdrew a complaint it had filed with
the European Commission in October 2007 with regard to IBM. Litigation
between the company and T3 continues. In January 2009, T3 filed a
complaint with the European Commission alleging that IBM violated European
Commission competition law based on the facts alleged in the pending U.S.
litigation.
 
The
company was a defendant in an action filed on March 16, 2007 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by SuperSpeed LLC, which
alleged that certain IBM products infringed certain patents relating generally
to cache coherency techniques. SuperSpeed sought damages and injunctive
relief.  The parties settled the action,
and in May 2009, the action was dismissed.
 
The
company and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in an action filed on August 17,
2007 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by
JuxtaComm Technologies, Inc., which alleges that certain IBM products
infringe a patent relating to the transformation and exchange of data between
different computer systems. JuxtaComm seeks damages and injunctive relief. The
case is set for trial in November 2009.
 
In January 2004,
the Seoul District Prosecutors Office in South Korea announced it had brought
criminal bid-rigging charges against several companies, including IBM Korea and
LG IBM (a joint venture between IBM Korea and LG Electronics, which has since
been dissolved, effective January, 2005) and had also charged employees of some
of those entities with, among other things, bribery of certain officials of
government-controlled entities in Korea and bid rigging. IBM Korea and LG IBM
cooperated fully with authorities in these matters. A number of individuals,
including former IBM Korea and LG IBM employees, were subsequently found guilty
and sentenced. IBM Korea and LG IBM were also required to pay fines. Debarment
orders were imposed at different times, covering a period of no more than a
year from the date of issuance, which barred IBM Korea from doing business
directly with certain government-controlled entities in Korea. All debarment
orders have since expired and when they were in force did not prohibit IBM
Korea from selling products and services to business partners who sold to
government-controlled entities in Korea. In addition, the U.S. Department of
Justice and the SEC have both contacted the company in connection with this
matter. In March 2008, the company received a request from the SEC for
additional information.
 
The
company is a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought in Tokyo District Court by
Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., which seeks to recover losses that it allegedly
suffered after IXI Co., Ltd. initiated civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy)
proceedings in Japan and apparently failed to pay Tokyo Leasing amounts for
which Tokyo Leasing now seeks to hold IBM and others liable. The claims in this
suit include tort and breach of contract.
 
The company is a
defendant in numerous actions filed after January 1, 2008 in the Supreme
Court for the State of New York, county of Broome, on behalf of hundreds of
plaintiffs. The complaints allege numerous and different causes of action,
including for negligence and recklessness, private nuisance and trespass.
Plaintiffs in these cases seek medical monitoring and claim damages in
unspecified amounts for a variety of personal injuries and property damages
allegedly arising out of the presence of groundwater contamination and vapor
intrusion of groundwater contaminants into certain structures in which
plaintiffs reside or resided, or conducted business, allegedly resulting from
the release of chemicals into the environment by the company at its former
manufacturing and development facility in Endicott. These complaints also seek
punitive damages in an unspecified amount.

The
company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S.
federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or
laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties
to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of
sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments
or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating
sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with
country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and
claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
 
The
company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental
assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with
Brazilian authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation
matters. These matters principally relate to claims for taxes on the
importation of computer software. The total amounts related to these matters
are approximately $2.4 billion, including amounts currently in litigation and
other amounts. In November 2008, the company won a significant case in the
Superior Chamber of the federal administrative tax court in Brazil and is
awaiting the published decision of the case. Assuming this decision is upheld,
the remaining total potential amount related to these matters for all
applicable years is approximately $500 million. In addition, the company has
received an income tax assessment from Mexican authorities relating to the
deductibility of certain warranty payments. In response, the company has filed
an appeal in the Mexican Federal Fiscal court. The total potential amount
related to this matter for all applicable years is approximately $500 million.
The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that these amounts
are not meaningful indicators of liability.
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No. 5),
the company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or
proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and proceedings are
reviewed at least quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the
impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other
information pertinent to a particular matter. Any recorded liabilities,
including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30,
2009, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its
experience, the company believes that the damage amounts claimed in the matters
previously referred to are not a meaningful indicator of the potential
liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently
uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters
previously discussed. While the company will continue to defend itself
vigorously, it is possible that the companys business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period
by the resolution of one or more of these matters. Provisions related to income
tax matters are recorded in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.
 
Whether
any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any such claim, suit,
investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the
companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
will depend on a number of variables, including the timing and amount of such
losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the
significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have on the
Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of
the particular matter which may give rise to additional factors.
 
15. Commitments: 
The companys extended lines of credit to third-party entities include
unused amounts of $4,623 million and $4,403 million at June 30, 2009 and December 31,
2008, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companys
business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the
company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection
with client purchase agreements for approximately $3,834 million and $3,342 million
at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
 
The company has applied
the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, to its agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses.
These disclosure provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5, by
requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the
likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following is
a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.

The company is a party to
a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the
other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise
in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the
company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising
from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title
to the assets sold, certain intellectual property (IP) rights, specified
environmental matters, third-party performance of non-financial contractual
obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment
by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically
allow the company to challenge the other partys claims. While typically
indemnification provisions do not include a contractual maximum on the companys
payment, the companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in
terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may
have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
 
It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements, due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had
a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of
operations.
 
In addition, the company
guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential
future payment under these financial guarantees was $85 million and $50 million
at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The fair value
of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position is not material.

16. Subsequent Events: On July 28, 2009, the company
announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55
per common share. The dividend is payable September 10, 2009 to
stockholders of record on August 10, 2009.
 
On July 28, 2009, the company announced that it had
entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire SPSS Inc., at a price of
$50 per share, resulting in a total cash consideration of approximately $1.2
billion. The acquisition is subject to SPSS shareholder approval, applicable
regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. It is expected to
close later in the second half of 2009. This acquisition is expected to further
expand the companys Information on Demand software portfolio and business
analytics capabilities, including the range of offerings available through the
companys recently announced Business Analytics and Optimization Consulting
organization and network of Analytics Solution Centers.

Within the Management
Discussion, selected references to adjusted for currency or at constant
currency are made so that the financial results can be viewed without the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating
period-to-period comparisons of the companys business performance.
 
In the second quarter, in a challenging global economic environment, the
company continued to deliver value to its clients, and strong financial results
to its investors  with profit growth fueled by margin expansion and a
continuing strong cash position. This performance is the result of the
strategic transformation of the company.
 
Since the beginning of the decade, the company has been moving out of
commoditizing businesses while investing in higher value areas  which drives a
more profitable mix. In addition, a focus on the global integration of the
company improves productivity and efficiency. The transformational changes to
the business have reduced IBMs fixed cost base and improved the operational
balance point. The strong profit and cash base funds the investments to capture
opportunity in the future and return capital to shareholders. Key areas of
investment include Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics and new compute
models such as cloud computing.
 
In the quarter, the
company delivered $2.32 in diluted earnings per share, an increase of 17.8
percent year to year. Total revenue decreased 13.3 percent as reported, 6.8
percent adjusted for currency. Pre-tax income of $4,262 million increased 11.8
percent, with pre-tax margin increasing 4.1 points due to improvements in gross
margin and expense. Net income margin improved 3.0 points versus the second
quarter of 2008, benefiting from an improved tax rate. The companys ongoing
common share repurchases drove a lower share balance contributing to the
improvement in diluted earnings per share.
 
The companys ongoing
shift to higher value areas has positioned the company to better meet the needs
of its clients. In the second quarter, strategic outsourcing signings increased
27.0 percent (38 percent adjusted for currency) and Key Branded Middleware
revenue  increased 5 percent, adjusted for currency. The companys strategic
acquisitions continue to contribute to the companys higher value capabilities.
Cognos, Telelogic, ILOG, XIV and Diligent all had strong performance in the
second quarter. The transformation of the company provided the largest benefit
to the improved profitability margins in the quarter. The shift to higher
value, the global integration of the business and ongoing productivity
initiatives all contributed to significant margin improvement. Overall, the
companys strategy and business model together delivered high levels of
profitability in a tough economic environment.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Second quarter revenue
growth was impacted by currency and the economic environment, but the companys
broad business capabilities, its ability to deliver value to customers and its
significant base of recurring revenues came through, with solid performance in
Software led by key branded middleware. As expected in this environment, the
companys transactional-based businesses were most challenged, specifically
hardware and consulting, where the company was impacted by a slowdown in
shorter term projects.
 
On
a segment basis, Global
Technology Services revenue declined 9.8 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency), Global Business Services 15.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency), Software 7.3 percent (essentially flat adjusted for currency),
Systems and Technology 26.0 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency) and
Global Financing 10.5 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Geographic revenue decreased 13.0 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter with consistent performance,
adjusted for currency, across the geographies. Revenue from the companys
growth markets decreased 11.1 percent as reported and increased 1 percent
adjusted for currency. Revenue from the major market countries decreased 13.4
percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) as customers remain highly focused on
saving costs and conserving cash.
 
The gross profit margin was
45.5 percent, an increase of 2.3 points, primarily due to improved margins in
Global Technology Services (1.3 points of the increase), improved revenue mix
and margin in Software (0.9 points of the increase) and improved margins in
Global Business Services (0.3 points of the increase). These increases were
partially offset by lower gross margins in Systems and Technology and Global
Financing.
 
Total expense and other
income decreased 18.8 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) for the second
quarter of 2009 versus the second quarter of 2008. Overall, the decrease was
driven by approximately 10 points due to the effects of currency  and 10 points due to the companys focus on
expense management.
 
The companys effective
tax rate for the second quarter of 2009 was 27.2 percent versus 27.5 percent in
the second quarter of 2008.
 
The company generated
$4,741 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of
$490 million, compared to the second quarter of 2008, primarily driven by
increased net income ($338 million) and changes in operating assets and
liabilities ($203 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,849
million was $718 million higher than the second quarter of 2008, primarily due
to increased investments in marketable securities and other investments in 2009
versus sales in 2008 ($1,911 million), partially offset by decreases in
acquisitions ($851 million) and net capital spending ($276 million). Net cash
used in financing activities of $3,743 million was $544 million lower, compared
to the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower payments to repurchase
common stock ($3,066 million), partially offset by lower receipts of cash from
other common stock transactions ($1,459 million) and an increase in net payments
associated with debt ($1,017 million).
 
Second-quarter 2009
Global Services signings were $13,988 million, a decrease of 4.8 percent year
to year (3 percent increase adjusted for currency). The company signed 17 deals
larger than $100 million in the second quarter of 2009. The estimated Global
Services backlog, as reported, was $132 billion at June 30, 2009, up $5
billion versus the March 31, 2009 balance (unchanged adjusted for
currency) and down $8 billion (up $1 billion adjusted for currency) versus the June 30,
2008 balance.

For the first six months
of 2009, in a challenging environment, total revenue decreased 12.4 percent as
reported, 5.4 percent adjusted for currency, versus the prior year. Pre-tax
income from continuing operations was $7,385 million, a 5.3 percent increase
compared to the first half of 2008. Diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations was $4.02, reflecting an 11.4 percent improvement year to year. The
key drivers of performance in the second quarter  the companys ongoing
transformation, shift to higher value areas and margin expansion  were the
primary contributors to the strong profit improvement in the first half of
2009.
 
Revenue growth for the
first half of 2009 was impacted by currency and the continuing economic environment.
Global Services revenue was supported by the strong annuity base. The Software
business continued to perform well, led by the Key Branded Middleware products
and the significant base of recurring revenues. Systems and Technology
performance reflects the challenges that transaction-based businesses are
facing in this environment.
 
On
a segment basis, Global
Technology Services revenue declined 9.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for
currency), Global Business Services 12.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for
currency), Software 6.9 percent (up 1 percent adjusted for currency), Systems
and Technology 24.9 percent (20 percent adjusted for currency) and Global
Financing 9.5 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Geographic revenue for the first six months of 2009
decreased 11.9 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) versus the same period
of 2008. Revenue from the companys growth markets decreased 11.5 percent
(increased 2 percent adjusted for currency) and revenue from the major markets
decreased 12.0 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency). The growth markets
have delivered revenue growth, adjusted for currency, approximately 8 points
higher than the major markets for the past 6 quarters.
 
The gross profit margin
was 44.5 percent, an increase of 2.1 points, primarily due to improved margins
in Global Technology Services (1.1 points of the increase), improved revenue
mix and margin in Software (0.7 points of the increase) and improved margins in
Global Business Services (0.3 points of the increase). These increases were
partially offset by lower gross margins in Systems and Technology and Global
Financing.

Table of Contents
 
Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Total expense and other
income decreased 14.4 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) for the first
six months of 2009 versus the first six months of 2008. Overall, the decrease
was driven by approximately 9 points due to the effects of currency  and 7 points due to the companys focus on
expense management, partially offset by increased
acquisition-related spending which accounted for approximately 2 points.
 
The effective tax rate
for the first six months of 2009 was 26.9 percent versus 27.5 percent for the
comparable period in 2008.
 
Total assets decreased
$5,869 million (decreased $7,101 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2008, primarily due to lower total receivables ($4,684 million), cash and cash
equivalents ($1,063 million), total deferred taxes ($398 million) and
intangible assets ($299 million), partially offset by increased marketable
securities ($682 million). The company had $12,526 million in cash and
marketable securities at June 30, 2009.
 
Total liabilities
decreased $7,758 million (decreased $8,099 million adjusted for currency) from December 31,
2008, primarily due to lower total debt ($4,553 million), accounts payable
($1,144 million), retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations
($993 million) and compensation and benefits ($722 million).
 
Stockholders equity of
$15,473 million increased $1,889 million from December 31, 2008, primarily
due to higher retained earnings ($3,975 million), equity translation
adjustments ($766 million) and common stock ($645 million), partially offset by
increased treasury stock ($3,508 million).
 
In the first half of 2009, the company generated
$9,127 million in cash flow provided by operating activities, an increase of
$675 million, compared to the first half of 2008, primarily driven by increased
net income ($315 million) and changes in operating assets and liabilities ($977
million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,897 million was $5,012
million lower than the first half of 2008, primarily due to the Cognos and
Telelogic acquisitions in 2008 and the sale of the core logistics operations to
Geodis in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities of $8,326 million was
$1,243 million higher, primarily due to an increase in net payments associated
with debt ($2,622 million) and lower receipts of cash from other common stock
transactions ($2,182 million), partially offset by lower payments to repurchase
common stock ($3,728 million) in the first half of 2009 versus the first half
of 2008.

The Global Services segments, Global Technology
Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS) had combined revenue of
$13,446 million, a decrease of 11.6 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and $26,598 million, a decrease of 10.7 percent (3
percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2009, respectively,
when compared to the same periods of 2008. In the second quarter, total Global
Services signings of $13,988 million decreased 4.8 percent (increased 3 percent
adjusted for currency) year over year. Signings in the outsourcing businesses
were $7,966 million, an increase of 3.1 percent (12 percent adjusted for
currency). Consulting and Systems Integration and Integrated Technology
Services signings were $6,022 million, a decrease of 13.5 percent (7 percent
adjusted for currency). The company signed 17 deals larger than $100 million in
the second quarter. The estimated Global Services backlog at actual currency
rates was $132 billion at June 30, 2009, an increase of $5 billion
(unchanged adjusted for currency) from the March 31, 2009 level. The
Global Services segments delivered combined pre-tax profit of $2,013 million in
the second quarter and $3,639 million in the first six months of 2009, an
improvement of 23.4 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, versus the same
periods of 2008. The Global Services business continued to drive increased
profitability and margin expansion in a challenging economic environment as a
result of the transformation that has been ongoing in both services segments.

Global Technology
Services revenue decreased 9.8 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and
9.7 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first
six months of 2009, respectively, versus the second quarter and first half
periods of 2008. Total second-quarter signings in GTS increased 5.4 percent (15
percent adjusted for currency) led by outsourcing signings growth of 13.1
percent (24 percent adjusted for currency).
 
Strategic Outsourcing
(SO) revenue decreased 8.8 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter and 9.1 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first
six months of 2009, respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. Revenue in
the second quarter was impacted by reduced volumes in the existing client base.
SO signings in the second quarter of 2009 increased 27.0 percent (38 percent
adjusted for currency), with growth in all geographies. This was the third
consecutive quarter of double-digit signings growth in SO, adjusted for
currency. The SO business provides innovative solutions to help clients drive
efficiency and cost savings.
 
Integrated Technology
Services (ITS) revenue decreased 10.1 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency)
in the second quarter and 8.6 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the
first six months of 2009 when compared to the same periods in 2008. The ITS
business continues to drive its product portfolio towards higher value, higher
margin offerings and away from OEM content. In the first half, the ITS revenue
decline was primarily driven by signings declines in the lower margin OEM
offerings that support capital intensive product rollouts. ITS signings in the
second quarter decreased 11.3 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency) year to
year.
 
Business Transformation
Outsourcing (BTO) revenue decreased 17.4 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) in the second quarter and 18.6 percent (9 percent adjusted for
currency) for the first six months of 2009 reflecting declines in client
business volumes driven by the slower economic environment, and an increased
focus on driving improved profitability in BTO. BTO signings decreased 41.5
percent (32 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter.
 
Maintenance revenue
decreased 9.7 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) and 9.5 percent (2
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2009, respectively, versus the prior year periods. Services provided to Ricoh
InfoPrint Solutions through the first five months of 2008, which transitioned
to Ricoh in June 2008, drove the majority of the revenue decline. Excluding
the InfoPrint services, maintenance revenue increased 1 percent and 2 percent,
adjusted for currency, in the second quarter and first six months of 2009,
respectively.
 
Global Business Services
revenue decreased 15.0 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) and 12.8
percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first half
of 2009, respectively, versus the prior year periods. Total signings in GBS
decreased 19.3 percent (14 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter.
Consulting and Systems Integration (C&SI) signings decreased 14.9 percent
(8 percent adjusted for currency) and Application Outsourcing signings
decreased 29.5 percent (27 percent adjusted for currency). Economic conditions
continue to impact GBS revenue and signings growth. GBS revenue performance
reflects lower signings in Consulting with a more pronounced decline in
smaller, faster-yielding contracts. System Integration revenue increased in the
second quarter, adjusted for currency. In addition, within total GBS, the
Public sector and the growth markets demonstrated strength in the quarter, both
posting revenue increases, adjusted for currency.

GTS gross profit
decreased 0.7 percent in the second quarter and 1.4 percent in the first half
of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008, with gross profit margins
improving 3.2 points and 2.9 points, respectively. All lines of business
delivered gross margin expansion, reflecting a shift to higher value offerings
and ongoing initiatives to improve productivity. Segment pre-tax profit
increased 41.3 percent to $1,405 million, with a pre-tax margin of 14.9 percent
in the second quarter, an improvement of 5.4 points over second-quarter 2008.
The first-half 2009 segment pre-tax profit increased 26.6 percent to $2,509
million, with a pre-tax margin of 13.5 percent, an improvement of 3.9 points
year to year. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit pre-tax
profit growth in GTS. This sustained margin performance is a result of the
transformation undertaken in GTS including structural changes to service
delivery and initiatives around standardization, global integration and
automation. The result has been a more flexible and productive organization,
operating with improved efficiency.  In
the second quarter, GTS executed significant cost and expense actions while
continuing to improve quality and customer satisfaction.
 
GBS gross profit margins
improved 1.3 points and 1.4 points in the second quarter and first half of
2009, respectively, reflecting ongoing initiatives to improve productivity.
Segment pre-tax profit decreased 4.5 percent to $608 million, with a pre-tax
margin of 13.3 percent in the second quarter of 2009, up 1.5 points year to
year. The first-half 2009 segment pre-tax profit decreased 7.1 percent to
$1,130 million, with a pre-tax margin of 12.3 percent, an increase of 0.7
points versus the first six months of 2008. In this difficult economic
environment, GBS has focused on driving margin improvement. The company has
built a global infrastructure and framework that supports a dynamic resource
deployment model. This has improved utilization and service delivery. In
addition, margin performance in the second quarter was driven by cost and
expense savings from recent workforce rebalancing actions, lower subcontract
spending, and higher utilization in the global delivery centers. The benefits
from these actions are expected to continue in the second half of 2009.

Global Services signings are managements initial
estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a Global Services contract.
Signings are used by management to assess period performance of Global Services
management. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the
calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates
and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type
and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or
wind-down costs.
 
Signings include SO, BTO, ITS and GBS contracts.
Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the
extent of the incremental new value. Maintenance is not included in signings as
maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal
renewals.
 
Backlog includes SO, BTO, ITS, GBS and Maintenance.
Backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract and
therefore does include Maintenance. Backlog estimates are subject to change and
are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope
of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized
and currency factors used to approximate constant currency.
 
Contract portfolios
purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments
provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings.
A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed
incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Software segment revenue
decreased 7.3 percent (flat adjusted for currency) and 6.9 percent (increased 1
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2009, respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. The Software business has
continued to perform well in a difficult economic environment, led by the Key
Branded Middleware products and the significant base of recurring revenues.
 
Key Branded Middleware revenue decreased 2.5 percent
(increased 5 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2009 and
3.1 percent (increased 5 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months
of 2009, when compared to the same periods in 2008. Key Branded Middleware
accounted for 58 percent of total Software segment revenue in the second
quarter, up 3 points from second-quarter 2008, and represented 56 percent of
total Software segment revenue for the first six months of 2009. Clients
continued to purchase software that delivers fast payback as well as software
for transformational projects with a strong return on investment.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
WebSphere Family revenue
increased 8.5 percent (17 percent adjusted for currency) and 6.9 percent (15
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2009, respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. Business Process
Management, Commerce and DataPower products all grew double digits in the second
quarter. ILOG, which helps to drive business rules management to the
analytics space, performed well and contributed to the growth in WebSphere
revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2009. ILOG middleware
grew over 50 percent year to year from its pre-acquisition levels.
 
Information Management
revenue decreased 3.8 percent and 5.6 percent (increased 4 percent and 2
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2009, respectively, versus the second quarter and first six months of 2008.
Cognos, which was acquired in January 2008, grew revenue 30 percent in the
second quarter and 9 percent in the first six months of 2009, adjusted for
currency. Information Integration and Master Data Management products, which
customers utilize to transform their enterprise data for competitive advantage,
also had strong revenue growth in the second quarter.
 
Lotus revenue decreased
14.5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) and 13.2 percent (6 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2009,
respectively, versus the same periods in 2008. Lotus performance was impacted
by a softening in demand driven by customer consolidations and downsizing.
 
Tivoli revenue decreased
1.7 percent and 1.6 percent (increased 6 percent and 7 percent adjusted for
currency) year over year  in the second
quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, driven primarily by
double-digit growth, adjusted for currency, in Tivolis storage products. This
growth in storage products is being driven by the higher value areas of
virtualization, de-duplication and open disk storage.
 
Rational revenue decreased 2.1 percent (increased 5
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and increased 2.5 percent
(11 percent adjusted for currency) in the first six months of 2009,
respectively, versus the comparable prior year periods. Customers leveraged the
productivity and return on investment enabled by the Rational suite of tools.
Rational products accelerate and simplify collaboration across the software
development process. Telelogic revenue increased 42.3 percent in the second
quarter and extended the brands reach into the systems development market
opportunity.
 
Revenue from Other middleware decreased 10.6 percent and
8.5 percent (4 percent and 1 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and first half of 2009, respectively.
 
Operating systems product
revenue decreased 10.5 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) and 8.9
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009, respectively, reflecting declining sales in all system brands.
 
Other software segment
revenue decreased 15.9 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency) in the second
quarter and 11.2 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) in the first half of
2009 primarily due to strong prior year results.

Software segment gross
profit decreased 6.0 percent to $4,436 million for the second quarter and 6.0
percent to $8,258 million for the first six months of 2009, driven primarily by
declining revenue. Gross profit margins expanded 1.2 points and 0.8 points in
the second quarter and first six months, respectively, versus the prior year
periods. The Software segment delivered $1,852 million of pre-tax profit in the
second quarter of 2009, an increase of 24.1 percent, and $3,186 million in the
first six months, an increase of 15.5 percent, when compared to the same
periods of 2008. The segment pre-tax profit margin was 32.0 percent and 29.1
percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2009, up 8.3 points and
5.8 points, respectively. The breadth of the software portfolio, the strong
recurring revenue stream and disciplined expense management  combined to deliver strong profit growth in a
challenging economic environment.

Systems
and Technology revenue decreased 26.0 percent (22 percent adjusted for
currency) and declined 24.9 percent (20 percent adjusted for currency) in
the second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, versus the same
periods in 2008 reflecting the challenges that transactional-based businesses
are facing in the current environment.
 
System z revenue decreased
39.4 percent and 31.4 percent (35 percent and 26 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2009
versus the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively. MIPS
(millions of instructions per second) shipments decreased 20 percent and 5
percent in the second quarter and first half of 2009 versus the second quarter
and first half of 2008, respectively. Volumes were impacted by strong prior
year performance, i.e. second quarter 2008 MIPs growth was 34 percent. MIPS
increased 4 percent in the second quarter on a two year compounded growth rate.
The companys growth markets revenue grew 1.6 percent and 14.4 percent (17
percent and 31 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first
six months of 2009, while major markets were weak as the company experienced a
lengthening of the clients decision cycle for hardware commitments. The 2009
periods had a strong compare to the 2008 periods as the company introduced the
new mainframe product in the first quarter of 2008.

Converged System p revenue
decreased 13.4 percent and 8.5 percent (8 percent and
3 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009 versus the second quarter and first six months of 2008,
respectively.  Low-end server revenue
declined 49 percent and 51 percent, in the second quarter and first six months
of 2009 versus the comparable periods in 2008, respectively.  Midrange server revenue decreased 9 percent
and 5 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2009 versus the
second quarter and first six months of 
2008, respectively. High-end server revenue decreased 10 percent and
increased 2 percent, for the same periods. Although revenue has declined, the
company has continued market gains in the midrange and high end of the product
line by helping clients increase efficiency in their data centers by leveraging
consolidation and virtualization results. In the second quarter, the company
significantly increased the number of UNIX competitive displacements to over
100  more than doubling the rate from the first quarter.
 
System x revenue decreased 22.1 percent and
25.2 percent (17 percent and 20 percent adjusted for currency) in the
second quarter and first six months of 2009, respectively, versus the second
quarter and first six months of 2008. System x server revenue declined 22
percent and 24 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2009
versus the comparable periods of 2008, respectively. High-end server revenue
decreased 24 percent for both the second quarter and first six months of 2009
versus the same periods in 2008, respectively. Blades revenue decreased 6
percent and 17 percent in the second quarter and first half of 2009 versus the
second quarter and first half of 2008, respectively. The company believes that improved
sales execution and strong performance from new products will enable the
product line to improve its performance in the second half of the year.
 
System Storage revenue
decreased 19.7 percent and 19.7 percent (15 percent and 14
percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of
2009 versus the comparable periods in 2008. Total disk revenue decreased 19
percent and 18 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and the first six months
of 2009 versus the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively.
These decreases were driven by declines in midrange disk revenue of 37 percent
for both periods and  decreased
Enterprise Disk revenue of 13 percent and 11 percent for the periods,
respectively. Tape revenue declined 22 percent and 24 percent in the second
quarter of 2009 and the first six months of 2009 versus the comparable periods
of 2008, respectively. The companys storage acquisitions are progressing well.
XIV added over 100 new customers in the second quarter and since the
acquisition, the company has added over 200 new clients who had not purchased
IBM Open Storage in the last two years. The value in storage continues to shift
to software as highlighted in the Software segment performance.
 
Microelectronics OEM revenue
decreased 22.5 percent and 29.2 percent (23 percent and 29 percent adjusted for
currency), respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2009
versus the comparable periods of 2008, respectively. The primary mission of this business is
to provide leadership technology for the systems business.
 
Retail Stores Solutions
revenue decreased 41.3 percent and 40.0 percent (36 percent and 34 percent
adjusted for currency) in the second quarter and first six months of 2009
versus the same periods in 2008, respectively, reflecting continued weakness in
the retail sector.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
The decreases in external gross profit for the second
quarter and first six months of 2009 versus the same periods of 2008 were
primarily driven by lower revenue across all brands.
 
Overall, gross margin in the second quarter decreased
1.5 points versus the prior year. Microelectronics OEM, System z and System
Storage impacted the overall margin by 1.6 points, 0.7 points and 0.2 points,
respectively; partially offsetting these declines was a benefit in the overall
margin of 1.2 points driven by converged System p.  First half gross margin decreased 2.2 points
compared to the first half of 2008. Microelectronics OEM, System Storage, System
z and System x impacted the overall margin by 1.5 points, 0.6 points, 0.5
points and 0.5 points, respectively; partially offsetting these declines was a
benefit in the overall margin of 1.1 points driven by converged System p.
 
Systems and Technologys pre-tax income decreased 16.7
percent in the second quarter, and 33.7 percent for the first six months when
compared to the prior year. Pre-tax margin increased 0.8 points and down 0.7
points in the second quarter and first six months, respectively, versus the
prior year periods.

Total
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased
18.7 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of
2009 versus the second quarter of 2008. 
Overall, the decrease was driven by reductions in operational expense
(down 12 points) as the company continues to focus on disciplined expense
management, while investing for future growth. Currency impacts also drove a
year-to-year decline (down 7 points), partially offset by acquisition-related
spending (up 1 point).
 
Total
SG&A expense decreased 12.9 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency)
in the first six months of 2009 versus the first six months of 2008. The first
half SG&A profile was similar to the second quarter with the year-to-year
change driven by: operational expense (down 7 points); currency impacts (down 8
points); and acquisition-related spending (up 2 points).   Workforce reduction expense increased $132 million due
to actions taken by the company in the first quarter, primarily in the services
business. Bad debt expense increased $65 million driven by additional specific
accounts receivable provisions. The companys accounts receivable provision

Other
(income) and expense was income of $28 million and $24 million in the second
quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in income in the second
quarter was primarily driven by higher gains on derivative instruments of $258
million. Included
within the foreign currency hedging activity, the company hedges its major
anticipated cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency
volatility in its global cash planning (the hedge of anticipated royalties and
cost transactions programs as discussed in Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 12 to 18), which also reduces volatility in the
year-over-year results.  The impact of
these specific hedging programs is primarily reflected in other (income) and
expense, as well as cost of goods sold. 
The income from these cash flow hedge programs reflected in other
(income) and expense was $102 million, a reduction in expense of $223 million
year to year. This increase in income was partially offset by a provision for
losses related to a joint venture investment ($119 million), lower interest
income ($58 million) and the reduction of income relating to sales of Lenovo
stock in the prior year ($57 million).
 
Other (income) and expense
was income of $331 million and $149 million for the first six months of 2009
and 2008, respectively. The increase in income for the first six months of 2009
was primarily driven by the
net gain ($298 million) reflected in Other in the table above, recognized from
the divestiture of the core logistics operations to Geodis in the first
quarter, lower losses on derivative instruments ($189 million) as discussed
above and improved foreign currency transaction impacts ($142 million) versus
the prior year. These items were partially offset by lower interest income
($167 million), the increase related to securities and investment assets ($148
million), which reflects the reduction of income relating to sales of Lenovo
stock in the prior year ($111 million), and the provision for losses related a joint venture investment ($119 million),
also reflected in Other in the table above.

The decrease in interest
expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 versus the same
periods of 2008 was driven by lower debt and interest rates. Interest expense
is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings
only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external
business. See page 61 for additional information regarding Global
Financing debt and interest expense. Overall interest expense for the second
quarter and first six months of 2009 was $282 million and $617 million, a
decrease of $48 million and $97 million, respectively.

Taxes
 
The effective tax rate
for the second quarter of 2009 was 27.2 percent versus an effective tax rate of
27.5 percent for the second quarter of 2008. The corresponding effective tax
rates for the first six months of 2009 and 2008 were 26.9 percent and 27.5
percent, respectively. The decline in the rate was primarily due to an increase
in tax credit benefits, partially offset by the loss of the tax benefit
associated with the joint venture charge.
 
With limited exception,
the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S.
income tax audits by taxing authorities for years through 2002. The years
subsequent to 2002 contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations
of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or
timing of income, deductions and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax
audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax
and interest have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result
for these years.
 
The company has certain
foreign tax loss carry-forwards that have not been reflected in the gross
deferred tax asset balance due to the level of uncertainty associated with the
sustainability of the losses which are under examination by the local taxing
authority. The tax benefit of these losses approximated $900 million at the end
of the second-quarter. If the tax loss carry-forwards are subsequently
utilized, recognition of the tax loss benefit will be made, including any
associated liability under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN48).
 
In addition, during the
second-quarter, foreign tax losses were utilized against a prior year tax
liability resulting in a cash benefit of approximately $360 million. However,
the company has recorded an unrecognized tax benefit in accordance with the
provisions of FIN48 given the degree of uncertainty in sustaining the
associated tax benefit.
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008,
determined in accordance with FIN48, increased by $614 million in the first six
months to $4,512 million.  Including the
second quarter item above, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by
$484 million during the second quarter of 2009. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the
effective tax rate is $3,958 million at June 30, 2009.
 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced its audit
of the companys U.S. tax returns for 2006 and 2007 in the first quarter of
2009.
 
See the 2008 IBM Annual Report, Note P, Taxes, on pages 99
to 101 for additional information.

Actual shares
outstanding at June 30, 2009 was 1,310.9 million. The
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during
the second quarter and first six months of 2009 was 65.1 million and
63.5 million lower than the same periods in 2008 primarily as a result of
the companys common share repurchase program.
 
Financial Position
 
Dynamics
 
At June 30, 2009,
the companys balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. Cash on hand
at quarter end was $11,678 million. Total debt of $29,373 million decreased
$4,553 million from prior year-end levels. The commercial paper balance at June 30,
2009 was zero, down from $468 million at year end. The company continues to
have substantial flexibility in the market. In the first six months of 2009,
the company generated $9,127 million in cash from operations, an increase of
$675 million compared to the first six months of 2008. The company has
consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have
access to additional sources of liquidity though the capital markets and its
$10 billion global credit facility. The companys strong cash flow and
substantial cash position permits the company to invest and deploy capital to
areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.
 
The assets and debt
associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of
the companys financial position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 4
and 5 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. The amounts

Current assets decreased
$4,568 million, including a currency benefit of $417 million, due to:
 
·                  A decline of $3,698 million in short-term
receivables driven by:
 
·                  a decrease of $3,960 million primarily
due to collections of higher year-end balances, partially offset by approximately
$263 million of currency benefit.
 
·                  A decrease of $590 million in prepaid
expenses and other current assets primarily resulting from:
 
·                  a decrease of $562 million in derivative
assets primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates; and
 
·                  a decrease of $230 million in prepaid
taxes driven by a U.S. Federal tax refund of $350 million received in the first
quarter; partially offset by
 
·                  an increase of approximately $182 million
in prepaid and deferred services transition costs.
 
·                  A decrease of $381 million in cash and
cash equivalents and marketable securities (see cash flow analysis on page 51).
 
Current liabilities
decreased $6,005 million, including a $162 million impact from currency, as a
result of:
 
·                  A decrease in short-term debt of $2,732
million primarily driven by:
 
·                  $5,027 million in payments; and
 
·                  a $468 million decrease in commercial
paper; partially offset by
 
·                  reclasses of $1,636 million from long-term to
short-term debt to reflect maturity dates; and
 
·                  $1,713 million in new debt issuances.
 
·                  A decrease in accounts payable of $1,144
million and a decrease of $722 million in compensation and benefits reflecting
declines from typically higher year-end balances; and
 
·                  A decrease of $1,018 million in other
accrued expenses and liabilities primarily due to:
 
·                  a decrease in derivative liabilities of
$428 million driven by changes in foreign currency rates; and
 
·                  a decrease of $378 million in workforce
reduction accruals reflecting cash payments made.

Net cash from operating
activities increased $675 million as compared to the first half of 2008 driven
by the following key factors:
 
·                  An increase in cash provided by accounts
receivable of $1,343 million, driven by Global Financing receivables ($1,245
million) and non-Global Financing receivables ($98 million) due to lower first
half 2009 revenue;
 
·                  A tax refund of approximately $360 million
in the second quarter resulting from foreign tax losses utilized against a
prior year tax liability;
 
·                  A U.S. Federal tax refund of $350 million
received in the first quarter; partially offset by
 
·                  Higher payments for workforce rebalancing
of $461 million; and
 
·                  Higher retirement-related funding for
non-U.S. plans of $251 million.
 
Net cash used in
investing activities decreased $5,012 million driven by:
 
·                  A decrease of $5,791 million in
acquisitions primarily driven by the acquisition of Cognos in 2008;
 
·                  A decrease in cash used in net capital
spending of $695 million driven by a decline in rental additions and lower
investments in the Strategic Outsourcing and Microelectronics businesses; and
 
·                  An increase in cash from divestitures of
$327 million as a result of the Geodis transaction in 2009; partially offset by
 
·                  The net impact of purchases and sales of
marketable securities and other investments that resulted in a use of cash of
$1,016 million in the current year in comparison to a source of cash in 2008 of
$1,114 million.
 
Net cash used in
financing activities increased $1,243 million as a result of:
 
·                  Increase of $2,622 million in net cash
payments to settle debt;
 
·                  A decrease of $2,182 million in cash
generated by other common stock transactions primarily due to lower stock
option exercises; partially offset by
 
·                  Lower common stock repurchases of $3,728

The decrease in
noncurrent assets of $1,301 million, including a currency benefit of $814
million, was driven by:
 
·                  A decrease of  $986 million in long-term financing
receivables driven by maturities exceeding originations;
 
·                  A decrease of $508 million in noncurrent
deferred taxes primarily due to the expected utilization of deferred taxes on
the companys current year tax return; and
 
·                  A decrease of $356 million in plant,
rental machines and other property driven by depreciation outpacing capital
spending;
 
·                  A decrease of $299 million in intangible
assets driven by amortization; partially offset by
 
·                  An increase of $582 million in pension
assets primarily driven by contributions; and
 
·                  An increase of $511 million in goodwill
primarily driven by currency.
 
Long-term debt decreased
$1,821 million primarily due to a reclass to short-term debt as certain
instruments approach maturity.
 
Other noncurrent
liabilities, excluding debt, were essentially flat as:
 
·                  A decrease in retirement and nonpension benefit
obligations of $993 million primarily driven by contributions; was partially
offset by
 
·                  An increase in other liabilities of $949 million
primarily driven by noncurrent tax reserves of $760 million.
 
Debt
 
The companys funding
requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage
the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains
sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.

Global Financing provides
financing predominantly for the companys external client assets as well as for
assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for Global
Services, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global
Financing asset portfolio. Based on their nature, these Global Services assets
are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base. The debt
analysis above is further detailed in the Global Financing section on page 61.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Given the significant
leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capitalization ratio which excludes
Global Financing debt and equity as management believes this is more
representative of the companys core business operations. The companys
long-term core debt-to-capitalization ratio objective is 20 to 30 percent.
This ratio can vary from period to period as the company manages its global
cash and debt positions.
 
Core
debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding Global Financing debt and equity) was
35.0 percent at June 30, 2009 compared to 48.7 percent at December 31,
2008. The reduction was primarily driven by the decrease in non-Global
Financing debt of $2,994 million from December 31, 2008 balances.
 
Consolidated
debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2009 was 65.5 percent versus 71.4
percent at December 31, 2008.
 
Equity
 
Stockholders equity
increased $1,889 million primarily as a result of an increase in retained
earnings of $3,975 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss
of $802 million and an increase of $645 million in common stock, partially offset
by an increase in treasury stock of $3,508 million, driven by the companys
common stock repurchases in the first half of 2009.
 
Looking Forward
 
The company delivers value to its clients through the following three
strategic priorities, which are described more fully in the 2008 IBM Annual
Report on pages 20 and 21, under the section entitled Strategy:
 
·        Focus on High-Value Solutions and Open Technologies
 
·        Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients
 
·        Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise
 
The company has a
significant global presence, operating in over 170 countries, with
approximately 65 percent of its 2008 revenue and 63 percent of its first-half
2009 revenue generated outside the U.S. This global reach gives the company
access to markets, with well-established organizations and management systems
that understand the clients and their challenges and that can respond to these
opportunities with value-add solutions. The companys transformation to a
globally integrated enterprise provides the capabilities to service clients
globally and deliver the best skills and cost from anywhere in the world.
 
In growth markets, the company will continue to invest
for revenue growth by capturing new infrastructure spending in these markets.
While these economies have slowed, these markets still offer good growth
opportunities relative to the rest of the world. The company has developed a
strong value proposition for the established markets based on cost reduction,
capital conservation and risk management.
 
Looking forward, the companys Smarter Planet
strategy is providing an important new opportunity to deliver value to clients.
The company anticipates a significant opportunity in smart infrastructure
projects as governments around the world implement economic stimulus programs
focused on next generation smart grids, healthcare-related information
technology and broadband. Projects of these types require technology
integration and industry insight which should uniquely position the company to
participate in these opportunities.
 
Two other key initiatives that the company is
investing in are business analytics and cloud computing. Business analytics
leverages the companys capabilities to optimize its clients business
performance by applying analytics to their business processes. Cloud computing
is an emerging model for delivering and consuming IT-enabled services.  In mid-June, the company announced the IBM
Smart Business cloud portfolio with solutions to help clients deploy their own
clouds targeting specific workloads. Each of these three opportunities require
enterprise software, deep industry process knowledge and solution integration
capabilities  all key strengths of the company.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
The company remains committed to technology leadership
and will continue to focus internal investments, complemented with strategic acquisitions,
on high-value, high-growth opportunities. The company invested over $6 billion
in RD&E in 2008 and approximately $30 billion over the past five years.
 
In addition, the companys financial position is
strong. Through its efficient cash generation business model based on
disciplined balance sheet management, in the first half of 2009, the company
generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow and had $12.5 billion in cash and
marketable securities at June 30, 2009. This provides the company with the
financial flexibility for investments in changing business environments. The
company will also continue its transformation to high-value segments with
continued focus on cost and expense management and improved efficiency. In 2008
and in the first half of 2009, those efforts translated to margin expansion and
the company expects this to continue for the balance of the year.
 
In May 2007, the company met with investors and analysts and discussed
a road map to deliver earnings per share in 2010 in the range of $10 to $11 per
share, or 14 to 16 percent compound growth rate from 2006. The companys 2010
roadmap is comprised of two key components. First, the 2010 roadmap includes
generating earnings per share in the range of $9 to $10 per share, or 10 to 14
percent growth from 2006 through a combination of operational elements
including revenue growth, margin improvement, growth initiatives, acquisitions
and effective capital deployment to fund growth and provide returns to
shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. In addition to
these operational elements, the companys roadmap to the $10 to $11 per share
range includes the projected benefit of retirement-related costs based on December 31,
2006 assumptions. Actual retirement-related costs will depend on several
factors including financial market performance, the interest rate environment
and actuarial assumptions. In March 2008 and May 2009, the company
met with investors and analysts and discussed the progress the company is
making on its 2010 roadmap.
 
In January 2009, the company disclosed that it was projecting earnings
per share of at least $9.20 per diluted share for the full year 2009, primarily
driven by margin improvement. In April 2009, the company reiterated its
projection of at least $9.20 per diluted share for 2009. In July 2009, the
company increased its projection for 2009 to at least $9.70 of diluted earnings
per share. In addition, as the company continues to execute its strategy and
maintains its focus on delivering profit and cash over the longer term, it
believes that it is ahead of pace of attaining its 2010 roadmap.
 
The companys performance in the first half of 2009 highlighted the
benefits of its global reach and the strength of its business model. The
financial results reflected solid progress on major elements of the long-term
goals, however, the company measures the success of its business model over the
long term, not any individual quarter or year. The companys strategies,
investments and actions are all taken with an objective of optimizing long-term
performance.
 
The company is a proven infrastructure provider of IT technology. The
companys broad product and services portfolio delivers value to clients 
through a combination of services, hardware and software. The portfolio is
focused on high-value solutions that can deliver measurable benefit to clients
with offerings that can address a wide scope of client issues including: energy
savings, security and resiliency, risk management and cost reduction among many
others.
 
The continued investments in Software have led to this segments emergence
as a strong source of revenue growth and the largest contributor to the companys
profit since 2007. The company expects Software pre-tax income to increase at a
double-digit rate in 2009. The Software business is differentiated in the
industry by both the strength of its individual products and the breadth of the
software offerings. Clients continue to rely on the extensive middleware
portfolio to help them transform their business, streamline costs and seek new
business opportunities. The key to continued Software growth stems from the
ability to maintain and grow this industry-leading software business, and by
continuing to capitalize on industry trends. Investments will be aligned to
advance the companys growth strategy through new client acquisition, with
specific focus on key industries and local businesses. The company will also
continue to focus on expanding its software capabilities through a combination
of internal development and strategic acquisitions.
 
Within the Global Services business, combined profit improved in the first
half driven by gross margin and pre-tax margin expansion. The company continues
to see the results of the targeted actions it has taken to transform the
services business model and continued to execute on cost and expense actions
consistent with that transformation in the first half. The Global Services
business enters the third quarter with strong executional momentum and a
revenue backlog of $132 billion, an increase of $1 billion from the prior year,
adjusted for currency. The company continues to evolve and adapt its offerings
to meet the changing needs for its clients. A key example is the new Business
Analytics and Optimization service line within GBS which will draw on the full
scope of the companys capabilities to solve clients business problems. The
company has redeployed and hired 4,000 resources to address this opportunity.
The company expects to see benefit from its first-half

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
actions in margin improvement for the remainder of the year, and also
expects the Global Services business to deliver double-digit pre-tax profit
growth for the full year.
 
In the Systems and Technology business, the company will focus its
investments on differentiating technologies with high-growth potential
including POWER, high-performance computing, virtualization, nanotechnology and
energy efficiency. In this market, the value has shifted to the high end to
address clients needs to consolidate and virtualize their environments. The
company will focus on providing clients with a clear path to a fully dynamic
infrastructure that not only reduces cost, but is both intelligent and secure.
In the third quarter, the company will announce new offerings, System z
Solution Editions, which will integrate a portfolio of enterprise software and
security products that will attract new workloads to the platform. The company
expects improved revenue performance in the third quarter and year-to-year
pre-tax profit growth in the fourth quarter in Systems and Technology.
 
The company expects 2009 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be
approximately $1.4 billion, essentially flat compared to 2008. This estimate
reflects current pension plan assumptions. For the period ending June 30,
2009, the estimated return on assets for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (U.S.
Plan) was (1) percent and for all worldwide defined benefit plans the
return on assets was 0 percent. In July, the company announced proposed changes
to the United Kingdom (U.K.) defined benefit plan. An employee consultation
period is required by law and will end in October, 2009.  See the companys 2008 Annual Report Note U, Retirement-Related
Benefits, on pages 106 to 116 for additional information.
 
The company expects in the normal course of business that its effective tax
rate in 2009 will be 26.7 percent. The rate will change period to period based
on non-recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and
changes in tax law, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix
of income before taxes, the timing and amount of foreign dividend repatriation,
state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.
 
Currency Rate Fluctuations
 
Changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect the companys results.
At June 30, 2009, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities
denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at
year-end 2008. The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to
limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other
foreign currency-based transactions. Further discussion of currency and hedging
appears in the 2008 IBM Annual Report in Note L, Derivatives and Hedging
Transactions, on pages 90 to 94.
 
In the first six months of 2009, the companys revenue
declined 12.4 percent as reported and 5.4 percent adjusted for currency. In the
second quarter, revenue decreased 13.3 percent as reported and 6.8 percent
adjusted for currency. This currency impact was driven from the companys
operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The company maintains
currency hedging programs for cash planning purposes which mitigate, but do not
eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial
results. In addition to the translation of earnings, the impact of currency
changes also may affect the companys pricing and sourcing actions. For
example, the company may procure components and supplies in multiple functional
currencies and sell products and services in other currencies. The company
believes that some of these currency-based changes in cost impacts the price
charged to clients. However, the company estimates that the maximum effect of
currency, before taking pricing or sourcing actions into account, and net of hedging
activity, negatively impacted total diluted earnings per share growth by less
than $0.01 in the second quarter and $0.08 for the first six months of 2009,
respectively.
 
For non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is
highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of
operations, as required by SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking
prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and, as needed, by entering into foreign
currency hedge contracts.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
In the companys 2008
Annual Report, on pages 45 to 47, there is a discussion of the companys
liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table
presented on page 45 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and
marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities
for each of the past five years. For the six months ended, or as of, as
applicable, June 30, 2009, those amounts are $9.1 billion for net cash
from operating activities, $12.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and
$10 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30,
2009 appear in the table below and remain unchanged from December 31,
2008.  The company does not have ratings
trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow
the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments
thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual
agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses
which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit
rating were to fall below investment grade. At June 30, 2009, the fair
value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $1,725 million,
before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in
fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding
instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual
arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a
material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

The table appearing on page 46
of the 2008 Annual Report presents the format in which management reviews cash
flows for each of the past five years and is accompanied by a description of
the way cash flow is managed, measured and reviewed. While the company prepares
its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with SFAS No. 95, Statement
of Cash Flows, on page 6 of this Form 10-Q and discusses causes and
events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 51, the
following is the management view of cash flows for the first six months of 2009
and 2008 prepared in a manner consistent with the table and description on page 46
of the 2008 Annual Report:

Free cash flow for the
first six months of 2009 increased $187 million versus the first six months of
2008. The improvement year to year was primarily driven by lower capital
expenditures. Also, in the first six months of 2009, $4,843 million was
returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
 
Events that could
temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above and in the
2008 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material
changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from
litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the
capital markets. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend
on a number of variables, which are more completely described in Note 14, Contingencies,
on pages 24 to 26 of this Form 10-Q. The company expects to make
legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of
approximately $1,100 million in 2009. 
The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding
because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets
or pension plan funding regulations.

Global
Financing
 
Global Financing is a
reportable segment that is measured as if it were a standalone entity.
Accordingly, the information presented in this section is consistent with this
separate company view.  The mission of
Global Financing is to facilitate clients acquisition of IBM hardware,
software, and services with the objective of generating consistently strong
returns on equity.

The decrease in revenue
in the second quarter, as compared to the same period in 2008, was primarily
due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 10.5
percent (4 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in financing
revenue (down 13.6 percent to $427 million), slightly offset by an increase in
used equipment sales (up 0.6 percent to $141 million); and
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 14.9
percent driven by decreases in internal financing (down 24.8 percent to $137
million) and used equipment sales to the Systems and Technology segment (down
9.7 percent to $310 million).
 
The decrease in external
and internal financing revenue was primarily due to lower average asset
balances.
 
The decrease in revenue
in the first six months of 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, was
primarily due to:
 
·                  A decline in external revenue of 9.5
percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) due to decreases in financing revenue
(down 11.4 percent to $877 million) and used equipment sales (down 2.9 percent
to $269 million); and
 
·                  A decline in internal revenue of 8.2
percent driven by a decrease in internal financing (down 22.7 percent to $298
million), offset by an increase in used equipment sales to the Systems and
Technology segment (up 2.4 percent to $538 million).
 
The decrease in external
and internal financing revenue was primarily due to lower average asset
balances.
 
Global Financing gross
profit decreased 5.4 percent in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the same
period in 2008, with gross margin increasing 4.7 points. Gross profit decreased
0.4 percent in the first six months of 2009 compared to prior year, with gross
margin increasing 5.3 points. The gross profit dollar decrease in both periods
was due to lower revenue.  The margin
improvement in both periods was due to an improvement in both financing and
equipment sales margins.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Global Financing pre-tax
income increased 8.6 percent in the second quarter of 2009 versus the same
period in 2008.  The increase was
primarily driven by a decrease in financing receivables provisions of $26
million and other selling, general and administrative expense of $45 million,
partially offset by the decrease in gross profit of $36 million.  Pre-tax income increased 1.1 percent in the
first six months of 2009 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a
decrease in other selling, general and administrative expense of $66 million,
partially offset by higher financing receivables provisions of $50 million and
the decrease in gross profit of $5 million.
 
The increase in return on
equity from second quarter 2009 to the same period in 2008 and for the first
six months of 2009 compared to the first six months of 2008 was primarily due
to a lower average equity balance.

(c)     These assets, along with
other financing assets in this table, are leveraged at the value in the table
using Global Financing debt.
(d)    Global Financing debt is
comprised of intercompany loans and external debt. A portion of Global
Financing debt is in support of the companys internal business, or related to
intercompany mark-up embedded in the Global Financing assets. See table on page 61.
 
Sources and Uses of Funds
 
The primary use of funds
in Global Financing is to originate client and commercial financing assets.
Client financing assets for end users consist primarily of IBM hardware,
software and services, but also include non-IBM equipment, software and
services to meet IBM clients total solutions requirements. Client financing
assets are primarily sales-type, direct financing and operating leases for
equipment as well as loans for hardware, software and services with terms generally
from two to seven years. Global Financings client loans are primarily for
software and services and are unsecured. These loans are subjected to
additional credit analysis in order to mitigate the associated risk and, when
deemed necessary, covenants are put into agreements to protect against
deterioration during the life of the obligation. Client financing also includes
internal activity as described on page 53 of the 2008 IBM Annual Report.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
Commercial financing
receivables arise primarily from inventory and accounts receivable financing
for dealers and remarketers of IBM and non-IBM products. Payment terms for
inventory financing and accounts receivable financing generally range from 30
to 90 days.  These short-term receivables
are primarily unsecured and are also subject to additional credit actions in
order to mitigate the associated risk.
 
Approximately
98 percent of Global Financings external financing assets are in the segments
core competency of technology equipment and solutions financing.  At June 30, 2009, approximately 59
percent of the external portfolio is with investment grade clients with no
direct exposure to consumers or mortgage lending institutions.

Total new originations
exceeded cash collections of both client and commercial financing assets in the
second quarter of 2009, which resulted in a net increase in financing assets in
this period. Cash collections of both client and commercial financing assets
exceeded new financing originations in the first six months of 2009, which
resulted in a net decline in financing assets from December 31, 2008. The
decrease in originations in both periods in the table above was due to lower
demand for IT equipment associated with the current economic environment.
 
Cash generated by Global
Financing was primarily deployed to pay the intercompany payables and dividends
to IBM.

Management Discussion  (continued)
 
The percentage of
financing receivables reserved increased from 2.0 percent at December 31,
2008 to 2.3 percent at June 30, 2009 due to the decline in the gross
financing receivables balance from December 31, 2008, and the increase in
the specific allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Specific reserves increased 4.7 percent from $386 million at December 31,
2008 to $404 million at June 30, 2009. 
Unallocated reserves decreased $16 million from $144 million at December 31,
2008 to $128 million at June 30, 2009 due to the decline in gross
financing receivables.
 
Global Financings bad
debt expense was an increase of $83 million for the six months ended June 30,
2009, compared to an increase of $33 million for the six months ended June 30,
2008. The increase in bad debt expense was attributed to the growth in specific
reserves.
 
In the second quarter of
2009, compared to the second quarter of 2008, bad debt expense decreased $26
million.
 
Residual Value
 
Residual value is a risk
unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon
the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease
inception.  Global Financing has insight
into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease.  Based upon this product information, Global
Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and
compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.
 
Global Financing optimizes the recovery of residual
values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to
new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.  Sales of equipment, which are primarily
sourced from equipment returned at the end of a lease, represented 44.4 percent
and 40.7 percent of Global Financings revenue in the second quarter and first
six months, respectively, of 2009 and 41.7 percent and 36.9 percent in the
second quarter and first six months, respectively, of 2008.  The increase in the second quarter and the
first six months of 2009 was driven primarily by the decrease in financing
revenue.  The gross margins on these
sales were 53.7 percent and 50.1 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and
2008, respectively.  The gross margins
were 52.0 percent and 47.8 percent for the first six months of 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The increase in both
periods is driven primarily by higher margin internal sales.
 
The following table
presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and
direct financing leases and operating leases at December 31, 2008 and June 30,
2009. In addition, the table presents the residual value as a percentage of the
related original amount financed and a run out of when the unguaranteed
residual value assigned to equipment on leases at June 30, 2009 is
expected to be returned to the company. In addition to the unguaranteed
residual value below, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain
guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease.
These third-party guarantees are included in minimum lease payments as provided
for by accounting standards in the determination of lease classifications for
the covered equipment and provide protection against risk of loss arising from
declines in equipment values for these assets. 
The residual value guarantee increases the minimum lease payments that
are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease
or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees
were $160 million and $280 million for the financing transactions
originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008,
respectively, and $266 million and $478 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. The associated
aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were
$10 million and $18 million for the financing transactions originated
during the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008,
respectively, and $16 million and $30 million for the financing
transactions originated during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30,
2008, respectively. The cost of guarantees was $1.3 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2009 and $2.3 million for the quarter ended June 30,
2008, and $2.1 million and $4 million for each of the six months
ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively.

The
company funds Global
Financing through borrowings using a debt-to-equity ratio target of
approximately 7 to 1. The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed
of intercompany loans and external debt. The terms of the intercompany loans
are set by the company to substantially match the term and currency underlying
the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. Both assets and
debt are presented in the Global Financing balance sheet on page 58.
 
The Global Financing
business provides funding predominantly for the companys external clients but
also provides intercompany financing for the company. As previously stated, the
company measures  Global Financing as if
it were a standalone entity and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt
supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included
in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 57 and in Segment
Information on pages 70 and 71.
 
In the companys
Consolidated Statement of Earnings on page 3, however, the external
debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing
to the company is reclassified from Cost of Financing to Interest Expense.
 
The following table provides additional information on total company debt.
In this table, intercompany activity is comprised of internal loans and leases
at arms length pricing in support of Global Services long-term contracts and
other internal activity. The company believes these assets should be
appropriately leveraged in line with the overall Global Financing business
model.

Financing was primarily deployed to pay intercompany payables and dividends to
the company in order to maintain an appropriate debt-to-equity ratio.

Looking Forward
 
Global Financings
financial position provides flexibility and funding capacity which enables the
company to be well positioned in the current environment. Global Financings
assets and new financing volumes are primarily IBM products and services
financed to the companys clients and business partners, and substantially all
financing assets are IT related assets which provide a stable base of business
for future growth.
 
The companys System z
and high-end converged System p servers announced in 2008 continue to be a
significant financing opportunity. Global Financings offerings are competitive
and available to clients as a result of the companys borrowing cost and access
to the capital markets. Overall, Global Financings originations will be
dependent upon the demand for IT products and services as well as client
participation rates.
 
IBM continues to access
both the short-term commercial paper market and the medium and long-term debt
markets.  A protracted period where IBM
could not access the capital markets would likely lead to a slowdown in originations.
 
Interest rates and the
overall economy (including currency fluctuations) will have an effect on both
revenue and gross profit. The companys interest rate risk management policy,
however, combined with the Global Financing pricing strategy should mitigate
gross margin erosion due to changes in interest rates.
 
The economy could impact
the credit quality of the Global Financing receivables portfolio and therefore
the level of provision for bad debts. Global Financing will continue to apply
rigorous credit policies in both the origination of new business and the
evaluation of the existing portfolio.
 
As discussed on page 60,
Global Financing has historically been able to manage residual value risk both
through insight into the companys product cycles, as well as through its remarketing
business.
 
Global Financing has policies in place to manage each
of the key risks involved in financing. These policies, combined with product
and client knowledge, should allow for the prudent management of the business
going forward, even during periods of uncertainty with respect to the economy.
