NOTE
1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 
OVERVIEW

 
The
Singing Machine Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”, “SMC”, “The Singing Machine”)
and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada (“Macau Subsidiary”), SMC Logistics,
Inc. (“SMC-L”) and SMC-Music, Inc.(“SMC-M”) are primarily engaged in the development, marketing, and sale
of consumer karaoke audio systems, accessories, musical instruments and musical recordings. The products are sold by SMC to retailers
and distributors for resale to consumers.
 
NOTE
2 – LIQUIDITY
 
In
August 2019, we received notification from a major customer that several containers of goods from multiple vessels purchased direct
import by the customer had arrived severely water damaged. Upon inspection of the damaged goods by insurance surveyors it was
their opinion that the source of the damage was due to moisture in the pallets provided by the factory which caused significant
condensation and consequently water damage to the merchandise. Actual damage to the goods occurred while the goods were in transit.
We have filed insurance claims on our cargo insurance policy which does provide for recovery of the sales value plus additional
expenses associated with the damaged goods. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, the customer charged us back a total
of approximately $48,000 for damaged goods consisting of sales value of approximately $46,000 which was recorded as a reduction
in net sales and approximately $2,000 in survey fees which were expensed as a component of general and administrative expenses
on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the customer
charged us back a total of approximately $1,691,000 for damaged goods consisting of sales value of approximately $1,580,000 which
was recorded as a reduction in net sales, approximately $109,000 in freight charges which were expensed as a component of sales
and marketing expenses and approximately $2,000 in survey fees which were expensed as a component of general and administrative
expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended December 31,
2019 we have incurred additional related expenses of approximately $127,000 and $346,000, respectively that were included as a
component of general and administrative expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. We continue
to gather the relevant information required to complete the insurance claims, however due to the significant extent of the damage
more time will be required by the underwriter to determine the final claim settlement. As such, we have recorded a refund due
to the customer of approximately $510,000 which reflects approximately $1,691,000 of chargebacks by the customer less approximately
$1,181,000 the customer has deducted on payment remittances to the Company as of December 31, 2019. We recognized an insurance
claim receivable of approximately $1,286,000 (the approximate cost of the damaged goods returned that will be destroyed) on the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. The timing of the collection of this insurance claim receivable
remains uncertain at this time.
 
As
of December 31, 2019 the Company was in default on the Revolving Credit Facility due to non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage
ratio in part due to the loss of margin and expenses associated with the damaged goods discussed above as well as a loss from
operations. In November 2019, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”)
whereby PNC “forbears” taking action it would be entitled to under a default through March 31, 2020 at which time
we would renegotiate renewal of the Revolving Credit Facility or obtain alternative financing.
 

 
As
of December 31, 2019 the Company did not meet the required EBITDA hurdle of greater than or equal to $400,000 for the third quarter
ended December 31, 2019 and is unlikely to meet the remaining hurdles of the Forbearance Agreement for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019 the Revolving Credit Facility has no outstanding balance and there have been no further
actions by PNC to exercise any of their options afforded to them as per the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility.
 
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,003,000 compared to net income of
approximately $1,473,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The Company expects cash flows from operations as well as
other financing resources to be adequate to satisfy working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months from the
date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company plans to supplement cash flows from
operations from several activities and resources including the following:
 


 
●
Reduce
    operating expenses.

 
 
 

 
●
Continue
    to negotiate renewal of the existing Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank prior to its expiration on July 15, 2020.

 
 
 

 
●
Continuing
    discussions for alternative financing arrangements with several financial institutions. 

 
 
 

 
●
Utilize
    “dynamic discount” programs offered by several of the Company’s major customers which allow for accelerated
    payment of invoices in exchange for an early pay discount.

There
can be no assurances that any of the above actions can be accomplished or that financing will be available on acceptable terms.
If the Company is unable to obtain financing or continues to experience sustained losses from operations this would have a material
adverse effect on its ability to meet its financial obligations when due.
 
NOTE
3 - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying
unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, such condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial position and the condensed
consolidated results of operations. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet information as of March 31,
2019 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended March 31, 2019. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
that report.
 
USE
OF ESTIMATES
 
The
Singing Machine makes estimates and assumptions in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances, warranty
reserves, inventory reserves and reserves for promotional incentives that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty; therefore,
the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Historically, past changes to these estimates have not had a
material impact on the Company’s financial condition. However, circumstances could change which may alter future expectations.
 
COLLECTIBILITY
OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
 
The
Singing Machine’s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s estimates of the creditworthiness of its
customers, current economic conditions and historical information, and, in the opinion of management, is believed to be in an
amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions. Management sets 100% reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other
reserves based upon historical collection experience.
 
The
Company is subject to chargebacks from customers for cooperative marketing programs, defective returns, return freight and handling
charges that are deducted from open invoices and reduce collectability of open invoices.
 
Should
business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the Company, this allowance may need to be
significantly increased, which would have a negative impact on operations.
 
FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
 
The
functional currency of the Macau Subsidiary is the Hong Kong dollar. The financial statements of the subsidiary are translated
to U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for
revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are recorded in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations and translations are recorded in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Any
such amounts were not material during the periods presented.
 
Concentration
of Credit Risk
 
At
times, the Company maintains cash in United States bank accounts that are more than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insured amounts. The Company also maintains cash balances in foreign financial institutions. The amounts at foreign financial
institutions at December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 are approximately $426,000 and $211,000, respectively.
 
Financial
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist of accounts receivable.
 
INVENTORY
 
Inventories
are comprised primarily of electronic karaoke equipment, microphones and accessories, and are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value, as determined using the first in, first out method. Inventories also include an estimate for the net realizable
value of expected future inventory returns due to warranty and allowance programs. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019
the estimated amounts for these future inventory returns were approximately $2,444,000 and $599,000, respectively. The Company
reduces inventory on hand to its net realizable value on an item-by-item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable
value of an inventory item falls below its original cost. A charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable
value of specific inventory items declines below cost. Management regularly reviews the Company’s investment in inventories
for such declines in value. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 the Company had inventory reserves of approximately $404,000
and $254,000 respectively for estimated excess and obsolete inventory.

LONG-LIVED
ASSETS 
 
The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication
that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the related assets are
less than the carrying amount, the carrying amounts are reduced to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360-10-05,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
 
PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT 
 
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is provided for in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to their estimated useful
lives using accelerated and straight-line methods.
 
FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
We
follow FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosures of information about the fair value of certain financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. For purposes of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial
instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than
in a forced sale or liquidation.
 
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
expenses, refunds due to customers and due to/from related parties approximates fair value due to the relatively short period
to maturity for these instruments. The carrying amounts on the subordinated debt to Starlight Marketing Development, Ltd. (related
party) and finance leases approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity and related interest accrued at
a rate similar to market rates. The carrying amount on the revolving line of credit approximates fair value due to the relatively
short period to maturity and related interest accrued at market rates.
 
REVENUE
RECOGNITION AND RESERVE FOR SALES RETURNS
 
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The Company’s
contracts with customers consist of one performance obligation (the sale of the Company’s products). Revenue is recognized
when the goods are delivered and control of the goods sold is transferred to the customer. The Company’s contracts have
no financing elements, payment terms are less than 120 days and have no further contract asset or liability obligations once control
of goods is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recorded in the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for
the sale of these goods.
 
Costs
incurred in fulfilling contracts with customers include administrative costs associated with the procurement of goods are included
in general and administrative expenses, in-bound freight costs are included in the cost of goods sold and accrued sales representative
commissions are included in selling expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
 
The
Company disaggregates revenues by product line and major geographic region as most of its revenue is generated by the sales of
karaoke hardware and the Company has no other material business segments (See NOTE 10).
 
The
Company generally does not allow products to be returned other than return allowance programs for goods returned to the customer
for various reasons and accordingly records a sales return reserve based on historic return amounts, events as identified and
management estimates.
 
The
Company’s reserve for sales returns were approximately $4,546,000 and $896,000 as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019,
respectively.

Revenue
is derived from four different major product lines. Disaggregated revenue from these product lines for the three and nine months
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:
 


 
STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION 
 
The
Company follows the provisions of the FASB ASC 718-20, “Compensation – Stock Compensation Awards Classified as Equity”.
ASC 718-20 requires all share-based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options, be measured at fair value
and expensed in the condensed consolidated statements of operations over the service period (generally the vesting period). The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value stock options. Employee stock option compensation expense for the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes the estimated fair value of options granted, amortized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for the entire portion of the award. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, the stock option expense was approximately $5,000 and $10,000, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, the stock option expense was $15,000 and $30,000, respectively.
 
ADVERTISING

 
Costs
incurred for producing and publishing advertising of the Company are charged to operations the first time the advertising takes
place. The Company has entered into cooperative advertising agreements with its major customers that specifically indicate that
the customer must spend the cooperative advertising fund upon the occurrence of mutually agreed events. The percentage of the
cooperative advertising allowance ranges from 1% to 13% of the purchase. The customers must advertise the Company’s products
in the customer’s catalog, local newspaper and other advertising media. The customer must submit the proof of the performance
(such as a copy of the advertising showing the Company’s products) to the Company to request for the allowance. The customer
does not have the ability to spend the allowance at their discretion. The Company believes that the identifiable benefit from
the cooperative advertising program and the fair value of the advertising benefit is equal or greater than the cooperative advertising
expense. Advertising expense, which is included as a component of selling expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of operations, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $2,040,000 and $1,328,000, respectively.
Advertising expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $3,820,000 and $2,877,000, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 there was an accrual for cooperative advertising allowances of $1,689,000 and $185,000,
respectively. These amounts were a component of accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
 
RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS 
 
Research
and development costs are charged to results of operations as incurred. These expenses are shown as a component of general and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, these amounts totaled approximately $13,000 and $27,000, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
these amounts totaled approximately $36,000 and $64,000 respectively.
 
INCOME
TAXES
 
The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method
of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If it is more likely than not that some portion
of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.
 
The
Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each interim period and, based on management’s best
estimate of its full year effective tax rate, recognizes cumulative adjustments to its deferred tax assets and liabilities. For
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we estimated our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. As of December 31,
2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $1,053,000 and $758,000, respectively. The
Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $240,000 and an income tax provision of approximately $367,000 for the
three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $295,000
and an income tax provision of $422,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(Unaudited)
 
The
Company recognizes a liability for uncertain tax positions. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position in a
previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is not based on clear and
unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or
annual periods. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. As of December 31, 2019, there were no uncertain tax positions that
resulted in any adjustment to the Company’s provision for income taxes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. The Company currently has no liabilities recorded for
accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions.
 
COMPUTATION
OF EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
 
Income
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during
the period. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 total potential dilutive shares from common stock options amounted to approximately
2,250,000 and 2,350,000 shares, respectively. These shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 because their effect was anti-dilutive. These shares were included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018.
 
ADOPTION
OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Topic 842, as amended, “Leases”. The ASU requires lessees to recognize
leases on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use
model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term
longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification
of expense recognition in the income statement. On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease standard using the optional
transition method under which comparative financial information will not be restated and continue to apply the provisions of the
previous lease standard in its disclosures for the comparative periods. (See Note 7– LEASES).
 
The
Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the
Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date. The liability is equal to the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. The asset is based on
the liability, subject to certain adjustments. Operating leases result in straight-line expense (similar to operating leases
under the prior accounting standard) while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to capital leases
under the prior accounting standard). As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s operating leases is not readily
determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The Company utilizes the
implicit rate for its finance leases.
 
RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740). Among several issues addressed in this ASU,
there was one area that may potentially affect the Company’s calculations of interim income tax provision or benefit. The
guidance specifies that an entity should apply the annual effective tax rate to the year-to date income or loss as long as the
tax benefits for any losses are expected to be realized during the year or would be recognizable as a deferred tax asset at the
end of the year eliminating the requirement of a valuation allowance for that interim period. There is specific guidance for circumstances
in which an entity incurs a loss on a year-to-date basis that exceeds the anticipated ordinary loss for the year, which is an
exception to the general guidance in Subtopic 740-270. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of this updated guidance
on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
 
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses” (Topic 326). This ASU represents
a significant change in the current accounting model by requiring immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current
expected credit losses. Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred, which delayed recognition of
expected losses that might not yet have met the threshold of being probable. The
amendments in ASU 2016-03 for smaller reporting companies are effective for fiscal years beginning after April 1, 2023 including
interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of this
updated guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December
31, 2019
(Unaudited)
 
As
of December 31, 2019 the Company remained in default on the Revolving Credit Facility due to non-compliance with the fixed charge
coverage ratio in part due to the loss of margin and related expenses associated with the damaged goods received by one major
customer in August, 2019. In November 2019, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with PNC whereby PNC “forbears”
taking action it would be entitled to under a default through March 31, 2020 and would continue forbearance actions provided the
Company continued to meet compliance with certain conditions (See Note 2 – LIQUIDITY).
 
As
of December 31, 2019 the Company did not meet the required conditions of the Forbearance Agreement and is unlikely to meet the
remaining hurdles of the Forbearance Agreement for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019 the Revolving
Credit Facility has no outstanding balance and there have been no further actions by PNC to exercise any of their options afforded
to them as per the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility.
 
Prior
the Forbearance Agreement interest on the Revolving Line of Credit was accrued at .75% per annum over PNC’s announced prime
rate with an option for the Company to elect the 1, 2 or 3 month fully absorbed PNC LIBOR Rate plus 2.75% per annum with a default
rate of 2% over the applicable rate. Upon execution of the Forbearance Agreement there was a pricing rate increase of .5% on the
.75% per annum rate and the PNC LIBOR Rate plus 2.75% (See Note 2 – LIQUIDITY). There is an unused facility fee equal to
.375% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility which will be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year
for the actual number of days elapsed and will be payable quarterly in arrears. During the three months ended December 31, 2019
and 2018 the Company incurred interest expense of approximately $86,000 and $100,000, respectively, on amounts borrowed against
the Revolving Credit Facility. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred interest expense
of approximately $119,000 and $155,000, respectively on amounts borrowed against the Revolving Credit Facility. During the three
months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred an unused facility fee of approximately $10,000 and $8,000, respectively
on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred
an unused facility fee of approximately $30,000 and $23,000, respectively on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
 
The
Revolving Line of Credit is secured by first priority security interests in all of the named borrowers’ tangible and intangible
assets as well as first priority security interests of 100% of member or ownership interests of any of its domestic existing or
newly formed subsidiaries and first priority lien on up to 65% of the borrowers’ foreign subsidiary’s existing or
subsequently formed or acquired foreign subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility is also secured by a related-party debt subordination
agreement with Starlight Marketing Development, Ltd. in the amount of approximately $803,000. Costs associated with renewal of
the Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $40,000 were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the agreement. During
the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred amortization expense of approximately $3,000 associated
with the amortization of deferred financing costs from the original Revolving Credit Facility. During the nine months ended December
31, 2019 and 2018 the Company incurred amortization expense of approximately $10,000 associated with the amortization of deferred
financing costs from the original Revolving Credit Facility.
 
Subordinated
Related Party Debt
 
The
subordination agreement was amended reducing the amount of related party subordinated debt to the remaining amount due of approximately
$815,000. Provision has also been made to allow repayment of the remaining $815,000 in quarterly installments of $123,000 including
interest accrued at 6% per annum commencing September 30, 2017 and ending on the debt maturity date of June 30, 2019. There are
no provisions to continue accruing interest on the outstanding principal amount due as of June 30, 2019. Payments of $123,000
are only permitted upon receipt of the Company’s quarterly compliance certificate; the Company having met the mandatory
pay-down of the Revolving Credit Facility to $1,000,000 and average excess availability for the prior 30 days (after subtraction
of third party trade payables 30 days or more past due) of no less than $1,000,000 after giving effect to the payment. As part
of the Conditions to Installment Payment of the subordinated debt, payments not made under this note that cannot be made as a
result of the foregoing prohibition, including payments after the scheduled maturity date, shall not be deemed an Event of Default
and can be made as soon as the Company is able to demonstrate that it meets the liquidity requirements defined above. Quarterly
installment payments of $123,000 due on the last day of each fiscal quarter have not been made since September 2017 due to the
Company not meeting these requirements; a payment of $123,000 which includes principal and interest, was not made during the three
months ended December 31, 2019. A payment of $25,000 was made in August 2019 with approximately $12,500 paying down the principal
and approximately $12,500 paying interest due. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred
interest expense of approximately $0 and $7,000 respectively on the related party subordinated debt. During the nine months ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred interest expense of approximately $0 and $20,000, respectively on the related
party subordinated debt. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the remaining amount due on the subordinated related party
debt was approximately $803,000 and $815,000, respectively.

North America that individually owed over 10% of total accounts receivable. At March 31, 2019, 62% of accounts receivable were
due from three customers in North America that individually owed over 10% of total accounts receivable.
 
The
Company generates most of its revenue from retailers of products in the United States with a significant amount of sales concentrated
with several large customers the loss of which could have an adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. For the
three months ended December 31, 2019, there were four customers who individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s
net sales. Revenue derived from these customers as a percentage of net sales were 27%, 17%, 13%, and 12% respectively. For the
three months ended December 31, 2018, there were five customers who individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s

OVERVIEW
 
The
Singing Machine Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”, “SMC”, “The Singing Machine”)
and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada (“Macau Subsidiary”), SMC Logistics,
Inc. (“SMC-L”) and SMC-Music, Inc.(“SMC-M”) are primarily engaged in the development, marketing, and sale
of consumer karaoke audio systems, accessories, musical instruments and musical recordings. The products are sold by SMC to retailers
and distributors for resale to consumers.
 
Our
products are sold throughout North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa primarily through major mass merchandisers and
warehouse clubs, on-line retailers and to a lesser extent department stores, lifestyle merchants, direct mail catalogs and showrooms,
music and record stores, and specialty stores.
 
Representative
customers include Amazon, Best Buy, BJ’s Wholesale, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, JC Penney and Wal-Mart. Our business
has historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations causing our revenues to vary from quarter to quarter and between the same
periods in different fiscal years. Our products are manufactured for the most part based on the purchase indications of our customers.
We are uncertain of how significantly our business would be harmed by a prolonged economic recession, but we anticipate that continued
contraction of consumer spending would negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.
 
Sales
of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season, which includes Christmas. A substantial
majority of our sales occur during the second quarter ending September 30 and the third quarter ending December 31. Sales in our
second and third quarter, combined, accounted for approximately 94% and 89% of net sales in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

QUARTER
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
 
NET
SALES
 
Net
sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 decreased to approximately $15,520,000 from $19,452,000 a decrease of approximately
$3,932,000 as compared to the same period ended December 31, 2018. There was a decrease in sales of approximately $512,000 to
our UK distributor and a decrease of sales to one major customer of approximately $1,596,000 both of whom ended the prior year
with excess inventory and reduced purchases during the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The remaining decrease of approximately
$1,824,000 was primarily due to additional sales adjustments required for the estimated returns of the new Carpool Karaoke The
Mic (“CPK”) product of approximately $532,000 that did not sell as well as projected and estimated additional returns
of core product due to a disappointing holiday season for the consumer electronics and toy industries in general.
 
GROSS
PROFIT
 
Gross
profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 decreased to approximately $4,033,000 from $5,626,000 a decrease of approximately
$1,593,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Approximately $1,136,000 of the decrease was commensurate with the
drop in net sales. The remaining decrease was primarily due to the increased sales adjustments required for estimated returns
of both the CPK products and core products.
 
Gross
profit margin for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was 26.0% compared to 28.9% for the three months ended December 31,
2018. The additional reserve accrual for estimated returns of CPK product contributed approximately 1.6 margin points of the decrease
due to the significantly higher margin yield of this product. The remaining 1.3 margin point decrease was primarily due the margin
yield on the estimated mix of excess core product to be returned by customers.
 
OPERATING
EXPENSES
 
For
the quarter ended December 31, 2019, total operating expenses increased to approximately $4,922,000 compared to approximately
$3,826,000 from the same period in the prior year. This represents an increase in total operating expenses of approximately $1,096,000
from the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Selling expenses increased by approximately $1,166,000, of which approximately $559,000
was due to an increase in advertising allowances granted to major customers to assist in sales of inventories during peak season,
approximately $314,000 was due to marketing and royalty expenses associated with the CPK product with the remaining variance primarily
due to additional expenses in freight related to the increase in returned goods.
 

20
 


 
General
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $83,000 to approximately $1,442,000 for the three months ended December
31, 2019 compared to approximately $1,525,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the reversal of an
accrual for unexercised and expired stock warrants issued to an investment banking firm previously expensed at a fair market value
of approximately $101,000 in a prior year.
 
(LOSS)
INCOME FROM OPERATIONS
 
There
was a loss from operations of approximately $889,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to income from operations
of approximately $1,800,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in income from operations of approximately
$2,689,000 was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and increase in selling expenses as explained above.
 
INCOME
TAXES
 
For
the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $240,000 and an
income tax provision of approximately $367,000, respectively, due to management’s best estimate of the Company’s full
year effective tax rate of approximately 22.7% and 22.0%, respectively.
 
NET
(LOSS) INCOME
 
For
the three months ended December 31, 2019 there was a net loss of approximately $758,000 compared to net income of approximately
$1,290,000 for the same period a year ago. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the same reasons discussed in (Loss)
Income from Operations and Income Taxes.
 
NINE
MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
 
NET
SALES
 
Net
sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 decreased to approximately $40,410,000 from $45,594,000 a decrease of approximately
$5,184,000 as compared to the same period ended December 31, 2018. There were decreases in sales of approximately $1,990,000 to
our UK distributor and approximately $1,237,000 to one major customer both of whom ended the prior year with excess inventory
and reduced purchases during the nine months ended December 31, 2019. There was a reduction in net sales of approximately $1,596,000
to one major customer who charged the Company back for goods shipped direct import that were damaged in transit (See Note 2 –
LIQUIDITY). The remaining decrease of was primarily due to additional sales adjustments required for the estimated returns of
the new CPK and core product.
 
GROSS
PROFIT
 
Gross
profit for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 decreased to approximately $10,663,000 from approximately $11,224,000 a decrease
of approximately $561,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in sales accounted for a decrease in
gross profit of approximately $1,275,000. There was an increase in the cost of our microphone products of approximately $104,000
due to the late season 15% tariff assessment that we were unable to pass on to the customer. These decreases in gross profit were
offset by approximately $893,000 the high margin yield of CPK product that was sold with the remaining variance due to margin
yield on mix of other products sold.
 
Gross
profit margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 was 26.4% compared to 24.6% for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
The sale of the new CPK product introduced in fiscal 2020 accounted for approximately 2.2 points of the gross profit margin increase
with the remaining .4 points of margin decrease primarily due to the mix of other products sold.
 
OPERATING
EXPENSES
 
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, total operating expenses increased to approximately $11,795,000 compared to approximately
$9,084,000 from the same period in the prior year. This represents an increase in total operating expenses of approximately $2,711,000
from the nine months ended December 31, 2018. Selling expenses increased by approximately $1,852,000, primarily due to discretionary
marketing expenses, commission and royalty expenses of approximately $806,000 primarily associated with the launch and sale of
the CPK product. There was an increase in advertising allowance expense of approximately $580,000 as incremental co-op advertising
was required to help customers sell through stock of CPK and core product due to lagging performance in holiday sales for the
consumer electronics and toy industries in general. There was an increase in freight costs of approximately $109,000 due to in-bound
freight and handling charged by one major customer for the return of damaged goods as explained in net sales.
 
General
and administrative expenses increased by approximately $863,000 to approximately $5,049,000 for the nine months ended December
31, 2019 compared to approximately $4,186,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2018. There was an increase of approximately
$295,000 in bad debt expense primarily due to recovery of bad debt from the Toys R Us bankruptcy during the nine months ended
December 31, 2018 of approximately $325,000 compared to no significant recovery of bad debt expenses during the nine months ended
December 31, 2019. Insurance expense increased approximately $135,000 over the same period ending December 31, 2018 due to accounts
receivable insurance purchased for a major customer. There was approximately $346,000 in administrative expenses relating to the
processing of damaged goods received by one major customer as explained in net sales with the remaining variance due to other
variable administrative expenses.
 
(LOSS)
INCOME FROM OPERATIONS
 
There
was a loss from operations of approximately $1,132,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 compared to income from operations
of approximately $2,141,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in income from operations of approximately
$3,273,000 was primarily due the decrease in gross profit and increase in selling and general administrative expenses as explained
above.

INCOME
TAXES
 
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $295,000 and an
income tax provision of approximately $422,000, respectively, due to management’s best estimate of the Company’s full
year effective tax rate of approximately 22.7% and 22.0%, respectively.
 
NET
(LOSS) INCOME
 
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2019 there was a net loss of approximately $1,003,000 compared to net income of approximately
$1,473,000 for the same period a year ago. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the same reasons discussed in (Loss)
Income from Operations and Income Taxes.
 
LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As
of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $519,000 as compared to cash on hand of approximately $211,000
on March 31, 2019. We had working capital of approximately $5,489,000 as of December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by operating
activities was approximately $684,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to approximately $1,498,000 used
in operating activities for the same period a year ago. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019 there was an increase in
accounts payable of approximately $5,742,000 partially due to pending resolution and payment of the related insurance claim filed
(See Note 2 – LIQUIDITY). There was an increase in reserves for sales returns of approximately $3,650,000 based on anticipated
returns of CPK product as well as in increase in overstock returns of core product due to decreased performance in the consumer
electronic and toy industry segments in general. There was an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $1,780,000 primarily
due to the significant increase in advertising allowance granted to customers to assist in customer product sell-through related
to the CPK product as well as to help mitigate overstock returns of core product after peak season. These increases in cash provided
by operations were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $6,125,000 due to peak season sales, an increase
in insurance receivable of approximately $1,286,000 relating to damaged goods claims from one customer (See Note 2 – LIQUIDITY),
an increase of approximately $2,229,000 in inventories due to increased estimated future returns primarily related to the CPK
product. There were increases in related party accounts receivable of approximately $895,000 due to peak seasonal amounts due
for goods shipped to our Canadian distributor. These activities accounted for approximately 93% of cash provided operations with
the remaining 7% due to seasonal changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
 
Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,498,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. During the nine months
ended December 31, 2018 the Company had net income of approximately $1,473,000 inclusive of bad debt recovery of Toys R Us bankruptcy
administrative claims of approximately $253,000. During this period accounts receivable increased by approximately $9,697,000
due primarily to the seasonal increase in net sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2018. This use of operating cash was
offset by operating activities that provided cash including a decrease in inventories of approximately $2,475,000 due to the sale
of prior year excess inventory related to the Toys R Us bankruptcy, a seasonal increase in accounts payable (primarily inventory
vendors) of approximately $1,745,000, a seasonal increase in accrued expenses of approximately $1,037,000, a seasonal increase
in reserves for estimated sales returns of approximately $1,324,000, an increase in amounts due to related parties of approximately
$294,000. These activities accounted for approximately 90% of the cash used in operations with the remaining 10% due to seasonal
changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
 
Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $517,000 as compared to
approximately $289,000 used in investing activities for the same period ended a year ago and consisted primarily of purchases
of molds and tooling for new products and a current fiscal year investment in a new Enterprise Resourcing Planning (ERP) system
of approximately $304,000.
 
Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $140,000 compared to cash
provided by financing activities of approximately $2,554,000 for the same period ended of the prior year. We received approximately
$284,000 from a financing arrangement with Dimension Funding to finance implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning system.
This increase in cash provided by financing activities were offset by payments of finance leases and the bank term note of approximately
$136,000.
 
As
of December 31, 2019 the Company was in default on the Revolving Credit Facility due to non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage
ratio in part due to the loss of margin and related expenses associated with the damaged goods received by one major customer
in August, 2019. In November 2019, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with PNC Bank National Association (“PNC”)
whereby PNC “forbears” taking action it would be entitled to under a default through March 31, 2020 at which time
we would renegotiate renewal of the Revolving Credit Facility or obtain alternative financing.
 

 

As
of December 31,2019 the Company did not meet the required EBITDA hurdle of greater than or equal to $400,000 for the third quarter
ended December 31, 2019 and is unlikely to meet the remaining hurdles of the Forbearance Agreement for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019 the Revolving Credit Facility was settled in full and there have been no further actions
by PNC to exercise any of their options afforded to them as per the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility.
 

22
 

 
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,003,000 compared to net income of
approximately $1,473,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The Company expects cash flows from operations as well as
other financing resources to be adequate to satisfy working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months from the
date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company plans to supplement cash flows from
operations from several activities and resources including the following:
 


 
●
Reduce
    operating expenses.

 
●
Continue
    to negotiate renewal of the existing Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank prior to its expiration on July 15, 2020.

 
●
Continuing
    discussions for alternative financing arrangements with several financial institutions.

 
●
Utilize
    “dynamic discount” programs offered by several of the Company’s major customers which allow for accelerated
    payment of invoices in exchange for an early pay discount.

 

There
can be no assurances that any of the above actions can be accomplished or that financing will be available on acceptable terms.
If the Company is unable to obtain financing or continues to experience sustained losses from operations this would have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition and the ability to meet its financial obligations when due.
 
INVENTORY
SELL THROUGH
 
We
monitor the inventory levels and sell through activity of our major customers to properly anticipate defective returns and maintain
the appropriate level of inventory. We believe that our warranty provision reflects the proper amount of reserves to cover potential
defective sales returns based on historical return ratios and information available from the customers.
 
SEASONAL
AND QUARTERLY RESULTS
 
Historically,
our operations have been seasonal, with the highest net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters (reflecting increased
orders for systems and music merchandise during the Christmas holiday season) and to a lesser extent the first and fourth quarters
of the fiscal year. Sales in our second and third fiscal quarters, combined, accounted for approximately 94% and 89% of net sales
in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Our
results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of orders placed and shipped
to customers, as well as other factors. The fulfillment of orders can therefore significantly affect results of operations on
a quarter-to-quarter basis.
 
INFLATION
 
Inflation
has not had a significant impact on our operations. We generally have adjusted our prices to track changes in the Consumer Price
Index since prices we charge are generally not fixed by long-term contracts.
 
OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
 
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.
 
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The
Company’s interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make subjective decisions, assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgement increases such judgements become even more subjective.
While management believes that its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may be materially different than
estimated. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions have not materially changed from those identified in the Company’s
2019 Annual Report.
